"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,9733308,R35GM128638,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2019,388750,0.012169473928459514
"Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models Modern computational techniques based on machine-learning (ML) and, more recently, deep-learning (DL) are playing a critical role in realizing the precision medicine initiative. However, there is a critical need to systematically combine these powerful data-driven techniques with prior molecular network knowledge to make more accurate predictive models while also satisfactorily explaining their predictions in terms of mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,9835005,F32GM134595,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fellowship', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Freedom', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'base', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'driving force', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human data', 'human model', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical sciences', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'sex', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61610,0.03406727833133117
"Advancing Human Health by Lowering Barriers to Electrophysiology in Genetic Model Organisms Project Summary The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has proven valuable as a model for many high-impact medical conditions. The strength of C. elegans derives from the extensive homologies between human and nematode genes (60-80%) and the many powerful tools available to manipulate genes in C. elegans, including expressing human genes. Researchers utilizing medical models based on C. elegans have converged on two main quantifiable measures of health and disease: locomotion and feeding; the latter is the focus of this proposal. C. elegans feeds on bacteria ingested through the pharynx, a rhythmic muscular pump in the worm’s throat. Alterations in pharyngeal activity are a sensitive indicator of dysfunction in muscles and neurons, as well as the animal’s overall health and metabolic state. C. elegans neurobiologists have long recognized the utility of the elec- tropharyngeogram (EPG), a non-invasive, whole-body electrical recording analogous to an electrocardiogram (ECG), which provides a quantitative readout of feeding. However, technical barriers associated with whole- animal electrophysiology have limited its adoption to fewer than fifteen laboratories world-wide. NemaMetrix Inc. surmounted these barriers by developing a turn-key, microfluidic system for EPG acquisition and analysis called the the ScreenChip platform. The proposed research and commercialization activities significantly expand the capabilities of the ScreenChip platform in two key respects. First, they enlarge the phenotyping capabilities of the platform by incorporating high-speed video of whole animal and pharyngeal movements. Second they develop a cloud database compatible with Gene Ontology, Open Biomedical Ontologies and Worm Ontology standards, allowing data-mining of combined electrophysiological, imaging and other data modalities. The machine-readable database will be compatible with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. It will be accessible to all researchers to enable discovery of relationships between genotypes, phenotypes and treatments using large-scale analysis of multidimensional phenotypic profiles. The research and commercialization efforts culminate in an unprecedented integration of genetic, cellular, and organismal levels of analysis, with minimal training and effort required by users. Going forward, we envision the PheNom platform as a gold standard for medical research using C. elegans. n/a",Advancing Human Health by Lowering Barriers to Electrophysiology in Genetic Model Organisms,9671422,R44GM119906,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Amplifiers', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacteria', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Feeds', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Image', 'Ingestion', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Locomotion', 'Market Research', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nematoda', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Periodicity', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Pump', 'Readability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Video Microscopy', 'addiction', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'commercialization', 'data mining', 'design', 'feeding', 'human disease', 'human model', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'phenotypic data', 'prevent', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'web app']",NIGMS,"NEMAMETRIX, INC.",R44,2019,475637,-0.003840164117506859
"Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks The goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods that will identify genes driving epistasis between quantitative trait loci. Genetic association studies in both humans and model organisms have been increasingly able to detect interactions among genetic variants that influence disease risk and pathogenesis. However, identifying which genes are represented by individual variants is a major challenge. Many variants influencing disease are situated between genes, and even those that are in genes may be representing an effect from a neighboring gene. In model organism studies the situation is even more problematic. In breeding experiments, genetic associations with phenotypes typically encompass large regions of DNA with many genes, and experimental follow-up to identify the genes responsible for the association is resource-intensive. To address this problem, we are developing computational tools to prioritize putative gene interactions in interacting genomic regions for biological follow-up. We use machine learning classifiers trained on functional gene-gene interaction networks and combinatorial optimization to identify likely candidate gene-gene interactions responsible for epistatic interactions between genomic regions. Our methods sift through enormous spaces of candidate interactions, retaining only those whose functional interactions identify as plausible for supporting the epistatic interaction. These tools hold promise to dramatically limit the resource-intensity of biological follow up of putative epistasis and to clarify the genetic architecture of complex disease. Genetic studies in humans and model organisms are critical to understanding how genes interact to influence disease. Standard association studies, however, do not identify individual genes, but rather large genetic regions containing many genes, and determining individual genes responsible for phenotypic effects requires resource-intensive biological follow-up experiments. We are developing computational methods to prioritize genes in these regions for biological follow-up, with the ultimate goal of speeding the discovery of novel roles of genes in disease.",Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks,9712956,R21LM012615,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Breeding', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic study', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Letters', 'Lower Organism', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human model', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'mutant', 'novel', 'supervised learning', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,JACKSON LABORATORY,R21,2019,223200,0.018222152380403787
"Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity Project Summary Our overarching goal is to understand how information characterizing genes and their function can be organized, integrated, and then generalized to new contexts. This is a central question of the post-genomic era, and one that becomes ever more pressing as novel assays expand the scope, breadth, and detail of information describing gene properties. While the Gene Ontology is the most prominent and universal system for organizing gene function, hundreds of others exist, often serving specialized research interests. Most laboratories depend on the validity of some subset of this data to design new experiments or interpret their results, but their quality is hard to directly ascertain, particularly in novel or complex integrative methodologies. Based on substantial preliminary data, we hypothesize that determining robustness and specificity will provide a highly general assessment of the utility of databases. We propose to use these properties to assess the entire corpus of resources organizing gene information, as well as the methods which exploit this information, and the results that they report. Critically, determining robustness and specificity does not require validation with respect to ‘gold standard’ information. By evaluating these resources with respect to their joint specificity and robustness we determine means of integrating and organizing their data for use in novel applications. Finally, we propose to apply our improvements in quality control to better target rare but robust results where this is an experimental goal, notably rare diseases and single cell expression. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Determine the uniqueness and robustness of data characterizing gene function. We develop a formal approach for characterizing robustness and uniqueness/specificity by exploiting prior probability in the form of gene multifunctionality. We will evaluate robustness and specificity across essentially all complex and structured databases characterizing genes. These measures can be compared between databases or over time and provide a global landscape of data structure. 2. Test methods designed to exploit information describing gene function. Statistical and machine learning methods exploiting structured data will be assessed for robust and specific output. Data features driving performance in diverse applications will be identified and complementary sources of data as well as community clusters will be defined. 3. Evaluate results that depended on the use of databases describing gene function. Using a combination of text-mining and figure-mining, we will assess the ongoing literature for novel, robust, and specific gene-function associations. We will characterize and evaluate the “dark matter” of gene-function association from both the point of unannotated genes as well as incomplete functions. Project Narrative Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene function in many different contexts and this data is captured in numerous resources which catalogue the varied properties of genes. The primary goal of this project is to explore and characterize the specificity and robustness of information about gene function within these databases. Because most biomedical experiments build on pre-existing knowledge, establishing guidelines for interpreting that data also has a large impact on our ability to understand novel results, particularly where they are unusual, as in many rare diseases.",Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity,9765396,R01LM012736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'comparative', 'dark matter', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2019,480000,0.05579578193340326
"The adaptive potential of translational regulation Project Summary/Abstract  Our current understanding of the adaptive effects of mutation is largely limited to alterations in protein coding sequence and disruption of transcriptional cis-regulatory promoters. Very little is known about how mutations alter translation, or the role these mutations play in adaptation and evolution. This project seeks to address this gap by identifying the functional effect of mutations on translation. To accomplish this I will first identify mutations that arise from adaptation to various nutrient limited environments. I will then use expression profiling (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and RATE-seq) to identify the effect these mutations have on translation, as well as other levels of gene expression. This will provide insight into the magnitude of effect mutations have on translation and their relative rate. Furthermore, to fully characterize the role synonymous mutations have on fitness I will be using a deep scanning synonymous mutation library. To understand the role tRNA abundance plays in the fitness effect of a given synonymous mutations, I will also be evaluating fitness within tRNA under- and over-expression backgrounds. Because of the closely coupled nature of translation rates and mRNA decay, I will also characterize the effect synonymous mutations have on mRNA decay using RATE-seq. My analysis of the functional effects of these mutations on gene expression, particularly within the genetic background and environment in which they arose, will allow for the development of a machine learning algorithm that can use sequence and annotation features to predict the effect of a mutation on gene expression. This tool will aid future research into the effect mutations have of gene expression by allowing the identification of high-confidence candidates for further evaluation.  This project will be conducted at New York University’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, whose mission is to answer otherwise intractable biological questions using applied experimental and computational approaches. The Center houses numerous facilities and cores that will be instrumental in the performance of this work. The collaborative atmosphere and multi-disciplinary nature of NYU’s research communities that will enable me to stay abreast of developments in related fields and to rapidly communicate my research to interested parties. I will be trained under the guidance of Dr. David Gresham, an excellent researcher working on complementing long-term evolution experiments with gene expression studies to characterize the adaptive potential of the regulation of gene expression. Project Narrative The translation of mRNA into protein is a critical step in gene expression that is tightly regulated with mis-regulation of translation being a hallmark of many human pathologies. Understanding how mutations can alter the regulation of translation is an understudied but important aspect of adaptation and evolution. Ultimately, without an understanding of the adaptive potential of translation we have an incomplete, and imperfect, picture of the underlying genetic causes of numerous forms of cancer and genetic diseases.",The adaptive potential of translational regulation,9683394,F32GM131573,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Pathology', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Nutrient', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathology', 'Performance at work', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Translation Initiation', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'analytical tool', 'cancer genetics', 'collaborative environment', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'preservation', 'promoter', 'response', 'ribosome profiling', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61226,0.02494011478727928
"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,9699752,R35GM131845,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Caenorhabditis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth', 'Hermaphroditism', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Meiosis', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Switch Genes', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'X Inactivation', 'autosome', 'chromatin modification', 'condensin', 'dosage', 'histone demethylase', 'male', 'man', 'neural network', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'sex', 'sex determination', 'single molecule', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2019,466290,0.01653301987307897
"Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme Project Summary/Abstract Background: The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This motivation has led to the development of radiogenomics, the study of the connection between a tumor’s underlying molecular traits and its clinical and imaging phenotypes. Radiogenomic analyses provide an opportunity to identify “imaging surrogates” for inferring gene expression. This is clinically applicable for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who routinely undergo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, current radiogenomic approaches make strong algorithmic assumptions, and results are potentially biased due to the many different ways that data is preprocessed and selected. The goals of this proposal are to (1) develop new radiogenomic models for identify imaging surrogates, and (2) systematically assess the robustness of radiogenomic findings. Aim 1: To evaluate the application of deep neural networks to discover radiogenomic associations. Aim 2: To compare resultant radiogenomic associations given different model inputs. Aim 3: To determine if the use of radiomic features increases specificity of radiogenomic associations. Methods: In Aim 1, deep neural networks will be trained on public GBM data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (gene expression), and The Cancer Imaging Archive (paired MR images). The model will take high-dimensional gene expression data and predict semantic imaging phenotypes derived from semi-automatically segmented regions-of-interest (ROIs) on MR images. To enable learning of deep networks, the gene expression profile of each patient will be parsed into numerous sparse vectors that encode molecular pathway information. After training, “activation maxi- mization” will extract imaging surrogates from the deep neural network. In Aim 2, a set of common feature selection methods will be applied to the gene expression data. Subsequently, the altered gene data will be the input to deep network to test their ability to derive consistent imaging surrogates. In Aim 3, radiomic features such as histogram and textural features will be extracted from the same ROIs segmented in Aim 1. Instead of semantic imaging phenotypes as the target output, the deep networks will take gene expression data and predict radiomic features. The inferred genes in each imaging surrogate from Aims 1–3 will be annotated with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using several major biological knowledge bases as reference gene sets. Enrichment scores will be normalized, assessed for significance using permutation testing, and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Long-term Objective: The development and systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods will help characterize the extent of overlapping information across biological scales in multimodal cancer patient data. Relevance to Public Health The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This research aims to develop new models to correlate tumor gene expression and its appearance in magnetic resonance images, and to perform a systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods to study their robustness in identifying meaningful biological mechanisms.",Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme,9656869,F31CA221061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tweens', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2019,39107,0.05641130550129949
"New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Cellular state transitions (i.e. from pluripotent to committed, replicative to quiescent, etc.) require the  coordinated regulation of thousands of genes. Therapeutically harnessing these transitions holds great  promise for human health;; for instance, autologous stem cell therapy has been successfully used in  regenerative medicine and cancer treatments, among others. While some of the key regulatory switches are  known, the field lacks a systems-­level understanding of the genomic circuits that control these transitions,  information that is critical for informed clinical intervention. Here, we will develop an integrated computational  framework to identify core gene regulatory circuits from large gene networks and predict their dynamics and  regulatory functions without the need of detailed network kinetic parameters. Advances in genomics profiling  technology have enabled the mapping of gene regulatory networks, thus we now have the capacity to identify  combinatorial interactions among genes and the master regulators of state transitions. Some systems biology  approaches have simulated the dynamics of a gene regulatory circuit, but traditional methods suffer from two  key issues. First, there is no rational rule to choose an appropriate set of regulator genes in a large network to  model. Second, since it is hard to directly measure most network kinetic parameters from experiment,  modeling results are based on a set of guessed parameters that can be less than optimal, limiting the  application of mathematical modeling to large systems and the prediction power of systems biology. To  address these issues, we recently developed algorithm named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE). RACIPE  generates an ensemble of circuit models, each of which corresponds to a distinct set of random kinetic  parameters, and uniquely identifies robust features, such as clusters of stable gene expression states, by  statistical analysis. We will further enhance RACIPE algorithms for large systems and new data analysis tools  using machine learning. This approach will convert a traditional nonlinear dynamics problem into a data  analysis problem, an essential step for extending the application of gene circuit modeling to large systems. It  also provides a novel strategy to integrate top-­down genomics approaches with bottom-­up mathematical  modeling. The algorithms will be tested and refined using literature-­based gene networks, public genomics  data, and data from collaboration, with a focus on cell differentiation in developmental processes and state  transitions in oncogenesis. Success of the project will result in a comprehensive toolkit that will unveil the gene  regulatory mechanism of cellular decision-­making in any cell of interest. The algorithmic development is   expected to have a broad impact on not only basic research in systems biology but also shed light on  therapeutic intervention in genomic medicine.      RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  Most human complex diseases are multigenic, but our understanding of the interactions between genes in  healthy states and how they are disrupted in disease states is lacking. Computational algorithms will be  designed to construct and model gene regulatory circuits of higher complexity to fill an important gap in our  understanding of the maintenance and transitions among cellular states and their abnormal behavior in  disease. In this proposal, we will develop a suite of systems-­biology tools to extend gene circuit modeling to  large systems and integrate genomics data relevant to fundamental cell biology, cancer, and other human  diseases.   ",New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits,9752643,R35GM128717,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autologous', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Public Health', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human disease', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'novel strategies', 'stem cell therapy', 'success', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2019,437500,0.03176954487631447
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery. NARRATIVE The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project will facilitate translational research by integrating and mining data about understudied druggable targets from numerous repositories and other resources. The KMC for IDG team will develop novel tools to analyze these data for the purpose of finding connections between genes/proteins/targets and diseases/phenotypes, cells/tissues, pathways/gene-sets, and drugs/small-molecules in order to identify potential applications to treat diseases and for other biological contexts of clinical relevance.",Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome,9623330,U24CA224260,"['Achievement', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Ion Channel', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Social Network', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time trend', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'community center', 'computerized data processing', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data visualization', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'druggable target', 'genomic profiles', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'online community', 'outreach', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'repository', 'response', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning', 'web site']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2019,249999,0.010626104753266391
"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,9738125,R01DE023575,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CDH1 gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryo Loss', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nasal cavity', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Palate', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Periderm', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Domains', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'craniofacial', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'embryo tissue', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model building', 'mutant', 'network models', 'novel', 'oral cavity epithelium', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'paralogous gene', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,225980,0.01617694775615192
"Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development Rotator cuff tears affect over 15% of Americans and impair shoulder joint biomechanics and function. Following repair of symptomatic tears, functional deficits frequently persist and re-tears are common, due to the complex anatomy and high functional demands on the rotator cuff tendons. Rotator cuff tendon tissue engineering research is focused on devices to improve immediate mechanical support to the repair and to stimulate early and rapid tendon regeneration rather than scarring and fibrosis, particularly for the supraspinatus tendon (SST), the most commonly torn tendon in the rotator cuff. Aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic both the highly aligned medial region of the SST, and bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the multi-axially aligned isotropic anterior region of the SST have been evaluated with promising results when seeded with adipose- derived stem cells (ASCs). However, progress in this area of rotator cuff tendon engineering and in other areas of tendon research is hindered by the lack of definitive markers for SST or for its regional heterogeneity, the lack of understanding to what extent ASCs are tenogenic and can assume the identity of tendon fibroblasts, the lack of specific markers for tendon fibroblast identity and tenogenic differentiation, and by a lack of markers for tendon maturation and response to mechanical loading in engineered tendon. Therefore, is it difficult to assess how successful current tendon tissue engineering approaches really are, or to predict how well tendon tissue engineered approaches will function in translation when autologous or allogeneic ASCs from diverse human populations are used to enhance rotator cuff repair via augmentation or interposition with engineered tendon devices. These studies will evaluate the epigenome (methylome), transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, metabolome and phenome (phenotype) of native human SST and donor-matched tissue engineered tendon produced from SST fibroblasts and ASCs. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate the data to an integrated multiome, which will then be used with machine learning approaches to extract key causal ‘driver’ genes, or tendon specific genes or molecules responsible for: 1) SST heterogeneity between medial and anterior regions. 2) Tendon cell identity and the extent of tenogenesis by ASCs on electrospun scaffolds. 3) The heterogenetic response by ASCs on uni- vs. bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the native heterogeneity of the SST. 4) The response of engineered tendon to dynamic loading. Identified driver genes or molecules will be validated though over-expression or silencing approaches, thus providing therapeutic targets for manipulation to enhance tenogenesis, and engineered tendon development and maturation. Together these innovative studies will provide a template for improved external validity of benchtop tendon tissue engineering and pre-clinical studies towards successful translation in diverse patient populations. In addition, the bioinformatics and multiomics toolboxes and assays that result from this work will be invaluable to not only the tendon research community, but also to the wider musculoskeletal and regenerative medicine fields. A small number of driver genes in other medical fields are responsible for changes in expression and protein levels in hundreds of other genes, and subsequent tissue metabolism. The process of tissue engineered rotator cuff tendon development and formation as it relates to adult tendon after surgical repair is not well understood, despite rotator cuff tears being an important clinical problem and representing almost one third of orthopedic injuries. Evaluating changes in the ability of genes to be translated to proteins at the DNA, RNA, small metabolite, and protein level of tissue engineered tendon formation under different loading conditions compared to normal adult tendon will identify driver genes and potential new ways to improve currently available options for rotator cuff repair.",Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development,9684263,R01AR073882,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cadaver', 'Cells', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Harvest', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joint structure of shoulder region', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stimulation', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'design', 'epigenome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multiple omics', 'overexpression', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preclinical study', 'progenitor', 'regenerative', 'repaired', 'response', 'rotator cuff tear', 'scaffold', 'spatial relationship', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'tendon development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'translation to humans']",NIAMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,485405,0.03135097153269058
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9746755,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,400001,0.028249109242110878
"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular physiology and is likely to reveal a subset of proteins that should be advanced as targets for new therapeutic drugs.",Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome,9762097,U24DK116204,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'human disease', 'human model', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knockout gene', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phosphoproteomics', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stable isotope', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2019,2265987,0.022583388024991293
"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,9727999,U24HG003345,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ensure', 'Equus caballus', 'Family', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Glutathione S-Transferase', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pan Genus', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudogenes', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Study models', 'Syntenic Conservation', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'Zebrafish', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'gene product', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'interest', 'member', 'novel', 'olfactory receptor', 'parallelization', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vertebrate genome', 'web site']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2019,550000,0.07298378799220735
"Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity Cortical GABAergic interneurons are critical components of neural circuitry, and their dysfunction has been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases. Although the diversity of interneurons is not disputed, both the extent of their heterogeneity and the gene regulatory mechanisms that drive it remain unclear. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing technology have shed new light on this issue, enabling the prediction of novel interneuron subtypes based on gene expression. Cross-species meta-analysis would provide key insight into conserved mechanisms of interneuron diversity. However, cross-study integration remains a major challenge. I hypothesize that interneuron identity is defined by unifying molecular processes across species. This project is designed to reveal these processes by using an integrative, cross-species approach to explore the transcriptional, epigenetic, and developmental mechanisms that govern interneuron diversity. First, I have shown that mouse interneuron subtypes replicably express genes associated with cell-cell communication, enabling cross-dataset meta-analysis. The goal of Aim 1 is to use improved computational and phylogenetic methods to define homologous interneuron subtypes across species and identify robust gene targets. Second, preliminary investigation of single cell methylome-sequencing data indicates that it can be readily aligned with expression data. In Aim 2 I will use machine learning methods to generate networks from epigenomic and expression data and identify subtype-specific regulatory features. Third, I have shown that transcriptional profiles from developing neurons can be quantitatively assessed with respect to adult expression data. Aim 3 will use meta-analytic aggregation of temporal inference methods to enable cross-dataset comparisons and define conserved developmental gene programs. These studies will reveal a multidimensional portrait of interneuron molecular identity and enable genetic access to these cell types, a key aim of the BRAIN Initiative. I also propose an extensive training plan that will support my transition to independence. CSHL provides an outstanding research environment, with unequaled opportunities for scientific discussion, advanced skills training and career development. I have assembled an exceptional team of collaborators and mentors who will help me to achieve my goals. Dr. Jesse Gillis, expert in transcriptome meta-analysis, and Dr. Josh Huang, expert in GABAergic interneuron identity, will be my mentors. Dr. Bing Ren, Dr. Adam Siepel, Dr. Guoping Feng, Dr. Jessica Tollkuhn and Dr. Michael Greenberg will be collaborators and members of my advisory committee, ensuring that my research will be of the highest caliber. My training will also involve coursework in multiomics data integration and comparative genomics, and I will continue my professional development by presenting at international conferences, mentoring students and attending workshops at CSHL. Together, the proposed studies and professional training will ensure my successful transition to an independent position at a major university where I will lead a lab that will advance the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. Interneurons are key components of neural circuitry, acting as the cellular `brakes' that dampen neuronal activity. Although it has long been known that interneurons come in many different shapes and sizes, both the extent of this diversity and its consequences for brain function remain unclear. In this project, we propose that by combining information about the gene activity and epigenetic landscapes of interneurons across multiple species we will generate an integrated, multi-layered portrait of interneuron diversity which we can use to understand brain",Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity,9754408,K99MH120050,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Lateral Geniculate Body', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Portraits', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'data integration', 'design', 'developmental neurobiology', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'methylome', 'neural circuit', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills training', 'student mentoring', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,K99,2019,118421,0.021955772379897712
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9706661,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2019,480000,0.07102316593506311
"UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The simplest conceptual model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. In this “independent action model”, if the TF has an activation domain, it activates the genes whose promoters it binds; if it has a repression domain, it represses the genes whose promoters it binds. It is remarkable then, that in existing, comprehensive data sets, that the vast majority of genes whose promoters are bound by a TF show no change in expression when the TF is knocked down or knocked out. In yeast data where all TFs have been analyzed, only 3-5% of bound genes respond when the TF is knocked out; in more recent, but less comprehensive human data it is rarely more than 15%. Furthermore, nearly every TF appears to activate some of the genes it binds while repressing others. These data show that we do not have a credible rough draft map of the regulatory logic of any eukaryote, as most of the genes bound by a TF in existing data are not regulated by that TF and we do not know how to predict which ones are. Our preliminary results show that some, but clearly not all, of the problem can be explained by technical issues inherent to the existing datasets. We there propose to generate new, comprehensive data sets that are ideally suited to studying the relationship between binding and functional regulation (Aim 1). We will use these datasets to quantify the predictive power of the independent action model. In Aim 2, we will collect genome- wide data focused understanding the interactions between TF binding and local chromatin state to see we can use the information to extend the independent action model to increase its predictive power. Finally, we will collect genome-wide data to identify TF-TF interactions that affect the gene expression response to perturbation. We will assess the predictive power of this information using computational models. This project will produce the first consistent data set that is well suited to studying the relationship between TF binding and regulation as well as the first credible overview of regulatory logic for any eukaryote. At the conclusion, we will know why perturbation of a TF apparently activates some of the genes it binds, represses other genes it binds, and does nothing at all to most of the genes it binds. Is it just the limitations of existing high-throughput data sets, or do interactions dominate independent action? What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The textbook model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. But the reality is that existing, large genomic data sets do not support this model. The proposed project will generate new genomic data sets to directly address this problem, and will investigate to what extent TF-chromatin and TF-TF interactions affect the relationship between TF binding and gene expression.",UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION,9789336,R01GM129126,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Eukaryota', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histones', 'Knock-out', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Repression', 'Resources', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Thermodynamics', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ursidae Family', 'Writing', 'Yeasts', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'improved', 'knock-down', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'response', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,314166,0.020700456417918667
"Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases Project Summary/Abstract Many diseases are understudied because they are rare or of little public interest. The effect of each understudied disease may be limited, but the cumulative effects of all these diseases could be profound. One common research challenge for these diseases is that the resources allocated to each is often limited. For instance, large- scale screening of drugs is often challenging, if not possible, in small labs. The decreasing costs of next generation sequencing make possible the generation of gene expression profiles of understudied disease samples. Integrating these expression profiles with other open data provides tremendous opportunities to gain insights into disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutics for understudied diseases. We have utilized a systems-based approach that employs gene expression profiles of disease samples and drug-induced gene expression profiles from cancer cell lines to predict new therapeutic candidates for hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma and basal cell carcinoma. All these candidates were successfully validated in preclinical models. The success of this approach relies on multiscale procedures, such as quality control of disease samples, selection of appropriate reference tissues, evaluation of disease signatures, and weighting cell lines. There is a plethora of relevant datasets and analysis modules that are publicly available, yet are isolated in distinct silos, making it tedious to implement this approach in translational research. A centralized informatics system that allows prediction of therapeutics for further experimental validation is thus of great interest to researchers working on understudied diseases. Accordingly, we propose four specific aims: 1) developing novel deep learning methods to select precise reference normal tissues for disease signature creation, 2) developing computational methods to reuse drug profiles from other disease models for drug prediction, 3) integrating open efficacy data to identify new targets from the systems-based approach, and 4) developing a centralized platform and promoting the platform in the scientific community. This proposal will reuse several big open databases (e.g., TCGA, TARGET, GTEx, GEO, LINCS, CTRP, GDSC) and employ cutting-edge informatics methods (e.g., deep learning). To demonstrate the scalability of the system, we will investigate three representative understudied diseases: multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (Aim 1), diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (Aim 2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Aim 3). Successful implementation of the systems-based approach can be used as a model for using other large open omics (proteins, metabolites) to discover therapeutics for diseases with unmet needs. This proposal will bring together experts in informatics, statistics, computer science, and physicians from Michigan State University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Spectrum Health. All data and code will be released to the public for continuing development. The system will be deployed to our OCTAD portal (http://octad.org), an open workplace for therapeutic discovery. Project Narrative About 25 million people are living with understudied diseases in the U.S. Although there are voluminous high dimensional molecular datasets that could be leveraged for research, individual labs have limited computational capacity to translate these molecular features into therapeutic hits. We propose to build a centralized information system that allows individual labs to easily harness open gene expression datasets and generate new therapeutic targets or drug candidates for further experimental validation.",Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases,9802075,R01GM134307,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Asia', 'Basal Cell', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Cancer cell line', 'Case Study', 'Cell Line', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evaluation', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Quality Control', 'Ramp', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'System', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Workplace', 'base', 'cancer gene expression', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'disorder control', 'drug candidate', 'drug mechanism', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open data', 'overexpression', 'pill', 'protein metabolite', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,453660,0.031352810316318695
"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest. The technologies developed will have important implications for modeling human disease in animal systems.",Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function,9654794,R24OD020166,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Embryo', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene-Modified', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Human', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operating System', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transgenes', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'method development', 'mutant', 'nuclease', 'recombinase', 'repaired', 'site-specific integration', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'vector']",OD,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2019,778412,0.05914129974654523
"Predictable control of gene regulation through epigenetic engineering PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Recent landmark discoveries have revealed that in addition to DNA lesions, epigenetic mechanisms also play a major role in cancer. Epigenetics is mediated in part by interactions of proteins and DNA that confer heritable gene expression states. Drugging the cancer epigenome is a burgeoning medical technology that currently uses small molecule inhibitors and small RNAs to disrupt hyperactive epigenetic enzymes. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that a new modality, fusion proteins that interact with the chromatin fiber, will activate therapeutic genes at sites that bear a specific pattern of cancer-related biochemical marks. The specific aims are to (2) use bioinformatic analyses to discover chromosome features that support inducible changes in gene expression states and (2) to use protein engineering to identify determinants of nuclear protein engagement.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods to reactivate dormant therapeutic genes in cancer cells are limited to inhibitors that bind epigenetic enzymes and other proteins.

"Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology There is now incontrovertible evidence from sophisticated lineage tracing studies that vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) de-differentiation contributes substantively to a number of vascular diseases. A major manifesta- tion of such phenotypic change is attenuated expression of a battery of VSMC-restricted genes, including the enigmatic smooth muscle calponin (Cnn1) gene. The function of Cnn1 has been studied primarily in vitro or in a single knockout mouse wherein several exons and introns were replaced with a neo cassette which, as detailed below, obfuscates accurate interpretation of phenotypes. We have championed the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system in mice to engineer subtle substitutions within regulatory elements of many genes, leaving intact all coding sequences. We report here a remarkable phenotype wherein a single base change of a single CArG box in the Cnn1 locus abolishes expression of CNN1 in vascular (but not visceral) SMC. Full expression of CNN1 is restored with a BAC carrying human CNN1 or CRISPR-mediated activation of the en- dogenous Cnn1 promoter. Cnn1 CArG mutant mice, representing the first animal models of regulatory element edits, also show elevation in VSMC DNA synthesis and defective contractile competence. Conversely, over- expression of BAC-CNN1 suppresses VSMC growth, antagonizes neointimal formation, reduces VSMC lipid uptake, and enhances contractile gene expression. Interestingly, CNN1-Ser175 appears to be a critical residue for some of these effects making it an attractive amino acid for CRISPR-mediated editing in mice. Additional data support CNN1 as a scaffold for ERK signaling and effector of the immotile state of differentiated VSMC. Importantly, a complete understanding of CNN1 function is complicated by robust expression of two related genes (Cnn2 and Cnn3) in VSMC. We hypothesize that CNN1 functions in concert with other CNN isoforms to maintain a mature VSMC differentiated state. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims using state-of-the-art tools in genetics, animal models of disease, and molecular physiology assays of VSMC function. Aim 1 will exploit the single base edit in Cnn1 as a novel loss-of-function mouse in context of acute and chronic vascular disease models; complementation studies will be carried out in vitro and in vivo to rigorously ascribe pheno- typic changes to the specific loss of CNN1. Aim 2 will exploit a well-characterized BAC mouse to elucidate functions associated with Cnn1 gain-of-function in models of vascular disease used in Aim 1. Complementary CRISPR editing of the BAC mouse, in background of Cnn1 KO, will afford exquisite insight into functional residues that mediate CNN1 function. Aim 3 will exploit new floxed Cnn2 and Cnn3 mice with an exciting VSMC-specific Cre driver we have developed to address, for the first time, triple Cnn KO mouse models at baseline and in acute or chronic vascular disease models. These studies, based on paradigm-shifting approaches to gene KOs, serve as a template for the study of other gene families linked to VSMC differen- tiation and will inform future studies targeting CNN1 in diseases where VSMC differentiation is compromised. Diseases of blood vessels involve radical changes in the normal program of gene expression and function, the underlying nature of which is poorly understood. We have used the revolutionary CRISPR system of genome editing to study a gene called CNN1, which is specific for smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. We will study this gene, along with related genes, in both cells and blood vessels to gain new insights into vascular diseases.",Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology,9671549,R01HL136224,"['Actins', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Aneurysm', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Injury', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth', 'Hematological Disease', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Introns', 'Ion Channel', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'LoxP-flanked allele', 'MAPK3 gene', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Serum Response Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'base', 'calponin', 'cell growth', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'gene function', 'genome editing', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'insight', 'knockout gene', 'loss of function', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'myocardin', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'response', 'scaffold', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vascular smooth muscle cell migration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2019,602307,0.039482335706391924
"Learning Dynamics of Biological Processes from Time Course Omics Datasets Complex biological processes, including organ development, immune response and disease progression, are inherently dynamic. Learning their regulatory architecture requires understanding how components of a large system dynamically interact with each other and give rise to emergent behavior. Recent experimental advances have made ii possible to investigate these biological systems in a data-driven fashion al high temporal resolution, allowing identification of new genes and their regulatory interactions. Longitudinal omics data sets are becoming increasingly common in clinical practice as well. Information on these collections of interacting genes can be integrated to gain systems-level insights into the roles of biological pathways and processes, including progression of diseases. Consequently, developing interpretable methods for learning functional relationships among genes, proteins or metabolites from high-dimensional time series data has become a timely research problem. The nature of these time-course data sets presents exciting opportunities and interesting challenges from a statistical perspective. Typical time-course omics data sets are challenging because of their high-dimensionality and non-linear relationships among system components. To tackle these challenges, one needs sophisticated dimension-reduction techniques that are biologically meaningful, computationally efficient and allow uncertainty quantification. Methods that incorporate prior biological information (e.g., pathway membership, protein-protein interactions) into the data analysis are good candidates for analyzing such high-dimensional systems using small samples. Here, we will develop three core methods to address the above challenges - (Aim 1): an empirical Bayes framework for clustering high-dimensional omics time-course data using prior biological knowledge; (Aim 2): a quantile-based Granger causality framework for learning interactions among genes or metabolites from their lead-lag relationships; and (Aim 3): a decision tree ensemble framework for searching cascades of interactions among genes from their temporal expression profiles. Our interdisciplinary team of statisticians and scientists will analyze time-course omics data from three research projects: (i) innate immune response systems in Drosophila, (ii) developmental process in mouse models, and (ii) longitudinal metabolite profiling of TB patients. These insights will be used to build and validate our methodology, which will be implemented in a publicly available software. This proposal is innovative in its incorporation of prior biological knowledge in the framework of novel dimension reduction techniques for interrogating high-dimensional time-course omics data. This research is significant in that it will impact basic sciences by elucidating data-driven, testable hypotheses on the regulatory architecture of biological processes, and clinical practice by monitoring disease progression and prognosis. n/a",Learning Dynamics of Biological Processes from Time Course Omics Datasets,9903643,R01GM135926,"['Biological Process', 'Data Set', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Time']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,351443,0.006570625373732238
"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of  information  from  the  NIH’s  ENCODE  project.  We  will  characterize  which  transcriptional  regulators  are  most  likely  responsible  for  perturbed  gene  expression,  their  signaling pathways and downstream targets. Previously unknown or understudied networks or genes identified  targeted for further analyses in placental growth and maturity and future prospective clinical studies.        PROJECT NARRATIVE    The normal development of the placental is essential for optimal pregnancy outcomes, and understanding normal  and  pathological  placental  development  will  allow  new  opportunities  to  prevent  major  public  health  concerns  such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. This work will seek to develop new, non-­ invasive  strategies  to  monitor  human  placental  maturation,  reflecting  normal  development,  against  which  deviations can be determined earlier in pregnancy for more effective interventions.   ","Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems

"Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis Despite major advances in prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it remains a major cause of deaths worldwide. As ASCVD is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and impact on this unmet residual risk. One such human polymorphism in the ID3 gene (rs11574) was associated with ASCVD in 3 distinct human cohorts. Notably, this SNP significantly attenuates ID3 function and studies in pre-clinical models confirm a critical role for ID3 in atheroprotection. We have previously shown that loss of ID3 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and promotes VSMC expression of inflammatory factors, processes linked to increase atherosclerosis. In collaboration with Dr. Gary Owens, we have generated a mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and VSMC-specific deletion of ID3 to study ID3-dependent VSMC specific changes during the course of lesion development in the context of the whole animal. We have developed a comprehensive CyTOF panel to identify and quantitate key cellular and intracellular changes in VSMC and other lesional cells in the aorta during the course of atherosclerosis development in these mice. To translate murine findings to humans, we have utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to knock out ID3 and produce the full allelic series of rs11574 in human cells and validated a reproducible system for differentiation of human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to VSMC. We will quantify the changes in VSMC phenotype in iPSC-derived VSMC with the full allelic series of rs11574. To further translate murine findings to humans, intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH) will be measured in human coronary arteries and analyzed with cutting edge image analysis techniques in collaboration with Dr. Milan Sonka at the University of Iowa. As such, our group is uniquely poised to dissect the role of this ASCVD-associated SNP and translate findings to humans. We hypothesize: that loss of ID3 in VSMCs will inhibit VSMC growth and promote a phenotype that exacerbates vessel wall inflammation and atherosclerosis lesion development; that human ID3 encoded by the risk allele aggravates these atherogenic VSMC functions; and that human subjects with the risk allele have larger coronary plaques with increased fatty deposits, necrotic cores and calcification compared to subjects homozygous for the common allele. As atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and further impact on ASCVD morbidity and mortality. Human ID3 gene polymorphism at rs11574 is associated with ASCVD in three unique human cohorts. Preliminary data supports a key role for ID3 in vascular smooth muscle cell biology linked to ASCVD. In the current proposal, we will utilize a novel mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and specific deletion of ID3 to elucidate the role of ID3 in promoting atherogenic VSMCs. We will then utilize CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMCs to identify the VSMC processes altered by the ID3 gene mutation linked to CVD. Lastly, we will determine if this ID3 gene mutation, alone or in combination with other gene mutations are associated with the amount and type of atherosclerotic plaque in human coronary arteries as measured by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology. Results have the potential to lead to novel targeted therapy for atherosclerosis.",Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis,9801966,R01HL148109,"['Alanine', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Aorta', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Iowa', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Necrosis', 'Null Lymphocytes', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Residual state', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Threonine', 'Translating', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'calcification', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary plaque', 'dimer', 'genome editing', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oxidized low density lipoprotein', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,687622,0.0024224892828309387
"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth in patients with refractory PA disease.",DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth,9767099,R01CA230328,"['Acromegaly', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dura Mater', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hypopituitarism', 'In Vitro', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Pituitary-dependent Cushing&apos', 's disease', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Publishing Peer Reviews', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Somatotropin', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'bone', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional status', 'genome-wide', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'methylome', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prognostic', 'small hairpin RNA', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,530660,-0.008674985038631676
"C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD PROJECT SUMMARY The Candidate is a postdoctoral fellow committed to developing an academic research group focused on applying bioinformatics to understand the pathophysiology of alcohol-related liver diseases (ALD). His previous and current postdoctoral work has given him the unique skillset to answer questions involving gene expression/regulation in the immune system. The Career Development Plan describes 2 years of mentored research wherein the candidate will develop skills in clinical immunology, generate the sequencing data outlined in the proposal, and learn leadership skills to transition into independence. The next 3 years, after obtaining an independent faculty position, will be dedicated to developing new data analysis pipelines and establishing cell biological and bioinformatics tools to understand gene regulation in the innate immune system, which will allow the candidate to establish future projects in ALD immunology. Research Plan: ALD is a spectrum of disorders that affect a growing number of people worldwide. Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that can increase the morbidity and severity of ALD disorders. In AH, the innate immune system is hypersensitive to microbial byproducts. Alcohol consumption causes gut-barrier disruption, leading to leakage of gut microbes into the portal circulation. The liver immune system is able to detect these microbes through pattern recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type Lectin receptors (CTLs). While TLRs have been well studied for their role in sensitizing the innate immune cells to microbial products, the CTLs have only recently been implicated in mouse models of ALD. CTLs are a large family of PRRs that sense a vast diversity of microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Our work has found that many members of the CTL gene family are upregulated in the liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs of AH patients. CTLs were also upregulated in PBMCs in response to LPS/TLR4 signaling. We predict CTLs are upregulated in response to gut- derived LPS in order to increase sensing for other microbes that may be present in the blood, making this pathway a secondary innate immune surveillance pathway. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis in three aims to address the functional role and regulation of this immune surveillance pathway, and the mechanism by which it is exacerbated in AH. First, we will use PBMCs isolated from AH patients to measure increased sensitivity to CTL agonists, as well as micro-/mycobiome sequencing to determine what microbial byproducts were in circulation in patients. Second, we will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the different monocyte subclasses, variation in CTL expression, and how different cell types respond to CTL agonists. Third, because CTL genes are clustered in the genome, we will use scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) to understand co-regulation of nearby genes in the genome. Altogether, this proposal will further our understanding of CTL mediated immune surveillance in host/microbial interactions during AH disease progression and potentially identify new therapeutic targets to decrease inflammation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that causes significant mortality among patients with Alcohol-related liver disease. In this project, we will investigate how the innate immune system and the micro- and myco-biome interact via a family of genes called the C-type lectin receptors (CTLs) to increase inflammation and disease severity among AH patients. The results of this project will expand our understanding of CTLs and immune surveillance, and provide new therapeutic targets for treatment of AH.",C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD,9870331,K99AA028048,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcohols', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'C Type Lectin Receptors', 'C-Type Lectins', 'CD14 gene', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Immunology', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elements', 'Ethanol Metabolism', 'Extravasation', 'FCGR3B gene', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Functional disorder', 'Fungal Components', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunology', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myelogenous', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'TLR4 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toll-like receptors', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transposase', 'Up-Regulation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cytokine', 'dectin 1', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fungus', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'immunological diversity', 'immunoregulation', 'inflammatory milieu', 'liver inflammation', 'liver injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'microbial', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'mouse dectin-2', 'mouse model', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'prevent', 'receptor expression', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIAAA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K99,2019,123096,0.0067242818986200876
"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,9573854,R35GM128638,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2018,388750,0.012169473928459514
"Machine Learning Model Validation for AD/ADRD PROJECT SUMMARY The primary goal of this Administrative Supplement is to study 20 candidate genes, previously not associated with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), in ADRD-relevant experimental models. These genes were identified by machine learning derived from meta-path-based protein knowledge graph integration. ADRD continues to be an intractable age-related neurodegenerative illness in elderly without a cure. Numerous clinical trials have failed in result in effective therapeutic management of ADRD. This unprecedented 99.6% failure rate in drug development targeting ADRD is, in part, due to lack of sufficient consideration of novel molecular pathways and mechanisms besides the ones neuropathologically associated with different dementias. The main thrust of this proposal is to use automated algorithmic network predictions based on the meta-path approach, by providing the integrated database developed at the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) Knowledge Management Center (KMC). Based on 13 distinct datasets totaling over 261 million datapoints, the AD-specific machine learning classifier model identified several key features, such as proteins that mediate inflammatory processes (JAK2, IL10 & IL2), response to oxidative stress (GSTP1), nervous system development (BDNF) and glycolysis (GAPDH). As a preliminary validation, we used human SHSY5Y cells that show robust hyper- phosphorylation of tau at S202 (itself a predictor of neurofibrillary tangle pathology relevant to ADRD) upon inflammatory stimuli (treated with cell supernatant from RAW macrophages). We used individual siRNA knockdown for the 20 predicted candidate genes in SHSY5Y cells prior to RAW macrophage media treatment, and assessed pS202-tau by Cellomics® unbiased high-content microscopy and quantitative morphometry. Four out of 20 candidate genes altered pS202 -tau levels in SHSY5Y cells, thus providing a proof-of-concept validation for the AD machine learning model. Based on this, we hypothesize that the AD-specific model is able to reliably identify novel biological datasets relevant to ADRD. We propose to test this hypothesis under three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will improve the meta-path machine-learning models and data mine novel associations. In Aim 2, we will perform in vitro biological validation for the top genes predicted by the meta-path approach. In Aim 3, we will build an interactive web platform to disseminate AD-gene associations. Successful completion of these studies will open up new avenues for ADRD research and may lead to novel therapeutic targets for ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the discordance between neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, ADRD, (e.g., amyloid beta pathology) and failed attempts to clinically manage ADRD therapeutically, there is an urgent need to identify novel drug targets. The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program, to which this supplement is linked-to, plans to utilize its integrated database to develop machine learning models that can predict novel disease-protein associations. Specifically, a set of 20 genes not previously associated with ADRD, were predicted using machine learning. Of these, 4 genes show significant biological effects (regulating hyperphosphorylation of tau at S202) in ADRD-relevant cellular models. The goals of this administrative supplement are to enhance machine learning models, to provide biological validation of candidate genes predicted from machine learning, and to propose novel drug ADRD targets.",Machine Learning Model Validation for AD/ADRD,9719312,U24CA224370,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Area Under Curve', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Balance training', 'Biological', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Experimental Models', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GSTP1 gene', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'IL2 gene', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Resources Management', 'Interleukin-10', 'Internet', 'Ion Channel', 'JAK2 gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retroviridae', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Sports', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tauopathies', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Transfection', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'age related', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'candidate validation', 'data mining', 'design', 'drug development', 'evidence base', 'forest', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'knowledge integration', 'macrophage', 'morphometry', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nervous system development', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'response', 'small hairpin RNA', 'tau Proteins', 'web app', 'web interface']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,U24,2018,378750,0.019987352857487338
"Advancing Human Health by Lowering Barriers to Electrophysiology in Genetic Model Organisms Project Summary The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has proven valuable as a model for many high-impact medical conditions. The strength of C. elegans derives from the extensive homologies between human and nematode genes (60-80%) and the many powerful tools available to manipulate genes in C. elegans, including expressing human genes. Researchers utilizing medical models based on C. elegans have converged on two main quantifiable measures of health and disease: locomotion and feeding; the latter is the focus of this proposal. C. elegans feeds on bacteria ingested through the pharynx, a rhythmic muscular pump in the worm’s throat. Alterations in pharyngeal activity are a sensitive indicator of dysfunction in muscles and neurons, as well as the animal’s overall health and metabolic state. C. elegans neurobiologists have long recognized the utility of the elec- tropharyngeogram (EPG), a non-invasive, whole-body electrical recording analogous to an electrocardiogram (ECG), which provides a quantitative readout of feeding. However, technical barriers associated with whole- animal electrophysiology have limited its adoption to fewer than fifteen laboratories world-wide. NemaMetrix Inc. surmounted these barriers by developing a turn-key, microfluidic system for EPG acquisition and analysis called the the ScreenChip platform. The proposed research and commercialization activities significantly expand the capabilities of the ScreenChip platform in two key respects. First, they enlarge the phenotyping capabilities of the platform by incorporating high-speed video of whole animal and pharyngeal movements. Second they develop a cloud database compatible with Gene Ontology, Open Biomedical Ontologies and Worm Ontology standards, allowing data-mining of combined electrophysiological, imaging and other data modalities. The machine-readable database will be compatible with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. It will be accessible to all researchers to enable discovery of relationships between genotypes, phenotypes and treatments using large-scale analysis of multidimensional phenotypic profiles. The research and commercialization efforts culminate in an unprecedented integration of genetic, cellular, and organismal levels of analysis, with minimal training and effort required by users. Going forward, we envision the PheNom platform as a gold standard for medical research using C. elegans. n/a",Advancing Human Health by Lowering Barriers to Electrophysiology in Genetic Model Organisms,9467327,R44GM119906,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacteria', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Feeds', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nematoda', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Periodicity', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Pump', 'Readability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Video Microscopy', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'commercialization', 'data mining', 'design', 'feeding', 'human disease', 'human model', 'member', 'phenotypic data', 'prevent', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'web app']",NIGMS,"NEMAMETRIX, INC.",R44,2018,510448,-0.003840164117506859
"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. This knowledge can be further applied to understand disease mechanisms of cancers and guide personalized treatment of cancer patients.",Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium,9462855,R01LM012011,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Canes', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Encyclopedias', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Models', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'cancer genome', 'cancer subtypes', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'supercomputer', 'translational medicine', 'translational study']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,327823,0.06545428315907265
"Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity Project Summary Our overarching goal is to understand how information characterizing genes and their function can be organized, integrated, and then generalized to new contexts. This is a central question of the post-genomic era, and one that becomes ever more pressing as novel assays expand the scope, breadth, and detail of information describing gene properties. While the Gene Ontology is the most prominent and universal system for organizing gene function, hundreds of others exist, often serving specialized research interests. Most laboratories depend on the validity of some subset of this data to design new experiments or interpret their results, but their quality is hard to directly ascertain, particularly in novel or complex integrative methodologies. Based on substantial preliminary data, we hypothesize that determining robustness and specificity will provide a highly general assessment of the utility of databases. We propose to use these properties to assess the entire corpus of resources organizing gene information, as well as the methods which exploit this information, and the results that they report. Critically, determining robustness and specificity does not require validation with respect to ‘gold standard’ information. By evaluating these resources with respect to their joint specificity and robustness we determine means of integrating and organizing their data for use in novel applications. Finally, we propose to apply our improvements in quality control to better target rare but robust results where this is an experimental goal, notably rare diseases and single cell expression. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Determine the uniqueness and robustness of data characterizing gene function. We develop a formal approach for characterizing robustness and uniqueness/specificity by exploiting prior probability in the form of gene multifunctionality. We will evaluate robustness and specificity across essentially all complex and structured databases characterizing genes. These measures can be compared between databases or over time and provide a global landscape of data structure. 2. Test methods designed to exploit information describing gene function. Statistical and machine learning methods exploiting structured data will be assessed for robust and specific output. Data features driving performance in diverse applications will be identified and complementary sources of data as well as community clusters will be defined. 3. Evaluate results that depended on the use of databases describing gene function. Using a combination of text-mining and figure-mining, we will assess the ongoing literature for novel, robust, and specific gene-function associations. We will characterize and evaluate the “dark matter” of gene-function association from both the point of unannotated genes as well as incomplete functions. Project Narrative Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene function in many different contexts and this data is captured in numerous resources which catalogue the varied properties of genes. The primary goal of this project is to explore and characterize the specificity and robustness of information about gene function within these databases. Because most biomedical experiments build on pre-existing knowledge, establishing guidelines for interpreting that data also has a large impact on our ability to understand novel results, particularly where they are unusual, as in many rare diseases.",Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity,9566292,R01LM012736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'comparative', 'dark matter', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,472478,0.05579578193340326
"Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks The goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods that will identify genes driving epistasis between quantitative trait loci. Genetic association studies in both humans and model organisms have been increasingly able to detect interactions among genetic variants that influence disease risk and pathogenesis. However, identifying which genes are represented by individual variants is a major challenge. Many variants influencing disease are situated between genes, and even those that are in genes may be representing an effect from a neighboring gene. In model organism studies the situation is even more problematic. In breeding experiments, genetic associations with phenotypes typically encompass large regions of DNA with many genes, and experimental follow-up to identify the genes responsible for the association is resource-intensive. To address this problem, we are developing computational tools to prioritize putative gene interactions in interacting genomic regions for biological follow-up. We use machine learning classifiers trained on functional gene-gene interaction networks and combinatorial optimization to identify likely candidate gene-gene interactions responsible for epistatic interactions between genomic regions. Our methods sift through enormous spaces of candidate interactions, retaining only those whose functional interactions identify as plausible for supporting the epistatic interaction. These tools hold promise to dramatically limit the resource-intensity of biological follow up of putative epistasis and to clarify the genetic architecture of complex disease. Genetic studies in humans and model organisms are critical to understanding how genes interact to influence disease. Standard association studies, however, do not identify individual genes, but rather large genetic regions containing many genes, and determining individual genes responsible for phenotypic effects requires resource-intensive biological follow-up experiments. We are developing computational methods to prioritize genes in these regions for biological follow-up, with the ultimate goal of speeding the discovery of novel roles of genes in disease.",Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks,9528022,R21LM012615,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Breeding', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic study', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Lower Organism', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human model', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,JACKSON LABORATORY,R21,2018,200175,0.018222152380403787
"New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Cellular state transitions (i.e. from pluripotent to committed, replicative to quiescent, etc.) require the  coordinated regulation of thousands of genes. Therapeutically harnessing these transitions holds great  promise for human health;; for instance, autologous stem cell therapy has been successfully used in  regenerative medicine and cancer treatments, among others. While some of the key regulatory switches are  known, the field lacks a systems-­level understanding of the genomic circuits that control these transitions,  information that is critical for informed clinical intervention. Here, we will develop an integrated computational  framework to identify core gene regulatory circuits from large gene networks and predict their dynamics and  regulatory functions without the need of detailed network kinetic parameters. Advances in genomics profiling  technology have enabled the mapping of gene regulatory networks, thus we now have the capacity to identify  combinatorial interactions among genes and the master regulators of state transitions. Some systems biology  approaches have simulated the dynamics of a gene regulatory circuit, but traditional methods suffer from two  key issues. First, there is no rational rule to choose an appropriate set of regulator genes in a large network to  model. Second, since it is hard to directly measure most network kinetic parameters from experiment,  modeling results are based on a set of guessed parameters that can be less than optimal, limiting the  application of mathematical modeling to large systems and the prediction power of systems biology. To  address these issues, we recently developed algorithm named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE). RACIPE  generates an ensemble of circuit models, each of which corresponds to a distinct set of random kinetic  parameters, and uniquely identifies robust features, such as clusters of stable gene expression states, by  statistical analysis. We will further enhance RACIPE algorithms for large systems and new data analysis tools  using machine learning. This approach will convert a traditional nonlinear dynamics problem into a data  analysis problem, an essential step for extending the application of gene circuit modeling to large systems. It  also provides a novel strategy to integrate top-­down genomics approaches with bottom-­up mathematical  modeling. The algorithms will be tested and refined using literature-­based gene networks, public genomics  data, and data from collaboration, with a focus on cell differentiation in developmental processes and state  transitions in oncogenesis. Success of the project will result in a comprehensive toolkit that will unveil the gene  regulatory mechanism of cellular decision-­making in any cell of interest. The algorithmic development is   expected to have a broad impact on not only basic research in systems biology but also shed light on  therapeutic intervention in genomic medicine.      RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  Most human complex diseases are multigenic, but our understanding of the interactions between genes in  healthy states and how they are disrupted in disease states is lacking. Computational algorithms will be  designed to construct and model gene regulatory circuits of higher complexity to fill an important gap in our  understanding of the maintenance and transitions among cellular states and their abnormal behavior in  disease. In this proposal, we will develop a suite of systems-­biology tools to extend gene circuit modeling to  large systems and integrate genomics data relevant to fundamental cell biology, cancer, and other human  diseases.   ",New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits,9574761,R35GM128717,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autologous', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Public Health', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human disease', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'novel strategies', 'stem cell therapy', 'success', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2018,437500,0.03176954487631447
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery.

"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well.

"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular physiology and is likely to reveal a subset of proteins that should be advanced as targets for new therapeutic drugs.",Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome,9564894,U24DK116204,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'human disease', 'human model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knockout gene', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phosphoproteomics', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stable isotope', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2018,2270717,0.022583388024991293
"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,9527894,U24HG003345,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ensure', 'Equus caballus', 'Family', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Glutathione S-Transferase', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pan Genus', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudogenes', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Study models', 'Syntenic Conservation', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'Zebrafish', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'duplicate genes', 'gene product', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'interest', 'member', 'novel', 'olfactory receptor', 'parallelization', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vertebrate genome', 'web site']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2018,550000,0.07298378799220735
"Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme Project Summary/Abstract Background: The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This motivation has led to the development of radiogenomics, the study of the connection between a tumor’s underlying molecular traits and its clinical and imaging phenotypes. Radiogenomic analyses provide an opportunity to identify “imaging surrogates” for inferring gene expression. This is clinically applicable for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who routinely undergo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, current radiogenomic approaches make strong algorithmic assumptions, and results are potentially biased due to the many different ways that data is preprocessed and selected. The goals of this proposal are to (1) develop new radiogenomic models for identify imaging surrogates, and (2) systematically assess the robustness of radiogenomic findings. Aim 1: To evaluate the application of deep neural networks to discover radiogenomic associations. Aim 2: To compare resultant radiogenomic associations given different model inputs. Aim 3: To determine if the use of radiomic features increases specificity of radiogenomic associations. Methods: In Aim 1, deep neural networks will be trained on public GBM data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (gene expression), and The Cancer Imaging Archive (paired MR images). The model will take high-dimensional gene expression data and predict semantic imaging phenotypes derived from semi-automatically segmented regions-of-interest (ROIs) on MR images. To enable learning of deep networks, the gene expression profile of each patient will be parsed into numerous sparse vectors that encode molecular pathway information. After training, “activation maxi- mization” will extract imaging surrogates from the deep neural network. In Aim 2, a set of common feature selection methods will be applied to the gene expression data. Subsequently, the altered gene data will be the input to deep network to test their ability to derive consistent imaging surrogates. In Aim 3, radiomic features such as histogram and textural features will be extracted from the same ROIs segmented in Aim 1. Instead of semantic imaging phenotypes as the target output, the deep networks will take gene expression data and predict radiomic features. The inferred genes in each imaging surrogate from Aims 1–3 will be annotated with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using several major biological knowledge bases as reference gene sets. Enrichment scores will be normalized, assessed for significance using permutation testing, and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Long-term Objective: The development and systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods will help characterize the extent of overlapping information across biological scales in multimodal cancer patient data. Relevance to Public Health The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This research aims to develop new models to correlate tumor gene expression and its appearance in magnetic resonance images, and to perform a systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods to study their robustness in identifying meaningful biological mechanisms.",Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme,9470767,F31CA221061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tweens', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2018,38615,0.05641130550129949
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9547382,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'fecal microbiota', 'gut microbiota', 'human microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolomics', 'metatranscriptomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota transplantation', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'stool sample', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,634157,0.027064799839876814
"UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The simplest conceptual model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. In this “independent action model”, if the TF has an activation domain, it activates the genes whose promoters it binds; if it has a repression domain, it represses the genes whose promoters it binds. It is remarkable then, that in existing, comprehensive data sets, that the vast majority of genes whose promoters are bound by a TF show no change in expression when the TF is knocked down or knocked out. In yeast data where all TFs have been analyzed, only 3-5% of bound genes respond when the TF is knocked out; in more recent, but less comprehensive human data it is rarely more than 15%. Furthermore, nearly every TF appears to activate some of the genes it binds while repressing others. These data show that we do not have a credible rough draft map of the regulatory logic of any eukaryote, as most of the genes bound by a TF in existing data are not regulated by that TF and we do not know how to predict which ones are. Our preliminary results show that some, but clearly not all, of the problem can be explained by technical issues inherent to the existing datasets. We there propose to generate new, comprehensive data sets that are ideally suited to studying the relationship between binding and functional regulation (Aim 1). We will use these datasets to quantify the predictive power of the independent action model. In Aim 2, we will collect genome- wide data focused understanding the interactions between TF binding and local chromatin state to see we can use the information to extend the independent action model to increase its predictive power. Finally, we will collect genome-wide data to identify TF-TF interactions that affect the gene expression response to perturbation. We will assess the predictive power of this information using computational models. This project will produce the first consistent data set that is well suited to studying the relationship between TF binding and regulation as well as the first credible overview of regulatory logic for any eukaryote. At the conclusion, we will know why perturbation of a TF apparently activates some of the genes it binds, represses other genes it binds, and does nothing at all to most of the genes it binds. Is it just the limitations of existing high-throughput data sets, or do interactions dominate independent action? What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The textbook model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. But the reality is that existing, large genomic data sets do not support this model. The proposed project will generate new genomic data sets to directly address this problem, and will investigate to what extent TF-chromatin and TF-TF interactions affect the relationship between TF binding and gene expression.",UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION,9578803,R01GM129126,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Eukaryota', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histones', 'Knock-out', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Repression', 'Resources', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Thermodynamics', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ursidae Family', 'Writing', 'Yeasts', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'improved', 'knock-down', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'response', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,311500,0.020700456417918667
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9527869,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,472477,0.07102316593506311
"Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species Project Summary To begin unraveling the mysteries of the brain we must first understand its fundamental unit: the neuron. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have resulted in the rapid generation of high dimensional data for individual cells, revealing vast heterogeneity and enabling the prediction of novel cell subtypes based on expression patterns. In spite of this wealth of data, a theoretical framework to define subtype identity is lacking. Cross-laboratory expression analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to obtain robust and replicable results and we have previously shown that scRNA-seq data is readily amenable to gene co-expression meta-analysis. Here, we propose that these methods, in combination with cross-species analysis, will provide important validation of novel subtypes, and allow for the identification of new gene functional modules that drive neuronal diversity. Our overall hypothesis is that coordinated gene expression patterns underlie neuronal identity and function. The specific aims to address this hypothesis combine both computational and experimental approaches. First, we will characterize cell-type specific co-expression using RNA-seq data from bulk tissue and from single cells, defining best practices for network construction and identifying and characterizing gene modules that are unique to single cell data. Second, we will define a data- driven cell type taxonomy for the mouse and human nervous systems, and use this to identify neuronal subtype marker genes for validation with co-in situ hybridization and follow up with gene targeting and further scRNA-seq experiments. Finally, we will elucidate functional pathways that are unique to or conserved across species by comparing mouse and human neuronal subtype co-expression networks, with a particular focus on characterizing the cell type specific connectivity of psychiatric disease genes. These aims are consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's strategic plan to describe the molecules, cells and neural circuits associated with complex behaviors. As a result, these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of neuronal diversity and identity, leading to improved understanding of the molecular pathology of brain disorders. Project Narrative It has long been known that there are many different kinds of neurons that are involved in controlling brain activity. However, it is unclear precisely how many different types of neurons exist, and to what degree human neurons resemble those of other animals. In this project we propose that by combining information about the gene activity in both human and mouse neurons we will begin to put together a final `parts list' of the nervous system which we can use to understand brain disorders.",Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species,9513320,F32MH114501,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'molecular pathology', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,F32,2018,51923,-0.004820541861958273
"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9490337,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosomal location', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'synthetic genomics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,397299,0.02763920387343193
"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner.

"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of  information  from  the  NIH’s  ENCODE  project.  We  will  characterize  which  transcriptional  regulators  are  most  likely  responsible  for  perturbed  gene  expression,  their  signaling pathways and downstream targets. Previously unknown or understudied networks or genes identified  targeted for further analyses in placental growth and maturity and future prospective clinical studies.        PROJECT NARRATIVE    The normal development of the placental is essential for optimal pregnancy outcomes, and understanding normal  and  pathological  placental  development  will  allow  new  opportunities  to  prevent  major  public  health  concerns  such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. This work will seek to develop new, non-­ invasive  strategies  to  monitor  human  placental  maturation,  reflecting  normal  development,  against  which  deviations can be determined earlier in pregnancy for more effective interventions.   ","Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems

"Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle (SMC) phenotypic modulation, the transition from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype accompanied by neointima formation following vascular injury, plays a critical role in the development and progression of several proliferative cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. The regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic modulation, however, are poorly understood. A hallmark feature of the phenotypic modulation is the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, down- regulates SMC gene expression and stimulates SMC proliferation via posttranscriptional regulation of the related genes. The post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in SMC phenotype gene expression, however, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data indicate that the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes is caused by abnormal RNA editing of their precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). This abnormal pre-mRNA editing is facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which converts adenosines to inosines (A->I editing). A-to-I RNA editing of the pre-mRNA transcripts from introns or 3'-untranslated regions alters pre- mRNA splicing, leading to decreased mature mRNA levels and abnormal cellular functions. PDGF-BB induces ADAR1 while down-regulating SMC myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and calponin (CNN). Knockdown of ADAR1 by shRNA restores PDGF-BB-blocked SMMHC and CNN expression, demonstrating that ADAR1 plays an essential role in SMC phenotype modulation. ADAR1 appears to be also important for PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation/survival. In vivo studies show that SMMHC and CNN pre-mRNA is accumulated when their mature mRNA is decreased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Moreover, ADAR1 is highly induced in media layer SMCs initially, and neointima SMCs subsequently following the injury. Of importance, knockdown of ADAR1 dramatically inhibits injury-induced neointima formation, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in vascular remodeling in vivo. These seminal findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that ADAR1/abnormal RNA editing mediates PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC contractile genes and SMC proliferation/survival, leading to SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) determine the role and mechanism whereby ADAR1 modulates SMC phenotype; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAR1 function in regulating SMC proliferation/survival; and 3) study the role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will unravel a novel mechanism governing SMC phenotypic modulation, which will ultimately lead to identification of novel targets for developing therapeuti agents to treat proliferative vascular diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in the United States. Transition of vascular smooth muscle (SMC) from a differentiated phenotype to a proliferative state accompanied by neointima formation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. In this application, a combination of molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches with gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies will be used to establish a novel mechanism underlying SMC phenotypic modulation. The completion of this project will advance our understanding of the fundamental pathologic mechanisms that contribute to the progression of aforementioned proliferative vascular diseases, and most importantly, lead to identification of important novel targets for developing therapeutic agents to treat these diseases.",Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling,9238787,R01HL119053,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'ADAR1', 'Adenosine', 'Angioplasty', 'Ants', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Bite', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Cell physiology', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryo', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypertension', 'Ice', 'Injury', 'Inosine', 'Introns', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'MYH11 gene', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Proliferation', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Veins', 'adenosine deaminase', 'calponin', 'gain of function', 'genetic approach', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'knock-down', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Precursor', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neointima formation', 'novel', 'platelet-derived growth factor BB', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'restenosis', 'small hairpin RNA', 'teration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2018,375000,0.030608773385328893
"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Orofacial clefting is a common disease that causes significant morbidity for the affected individual and a major burden to families and society. The etiology of orofacial clefting is complex, but genetic factors contribute significant risk. To date, scores of genes have been identified where rare variants cause rare syndromic forms of orofacial clefting, and DNA variants at 24 loci have been associated with the common non-syndromic form of orofacial clefting. Despite these efforts, less than half of the heritable risk has been identified. In addition, the pathogenic variant has yet to be determined at most of the 24 associated loci. New approaches are needed to identify these genetic risk factors. Since most of the associated loci are located between genes, it is hypothesized that the pathogenic allele is in a regulatory element. Thus, the new approaches should not only help find new candidate genes but they should also find the elements that regulate the expression of those genes. In this proposal, we will use a triumvirate approach to find new candidate genes, the DNA elements that regulate their expression and the transcription factors that bind to those regulatory elements. In total, analysis of these three datasets will yield a gene regulatory network for a target tissue. The target tissue for this proposal is periderm. Periderm is the most superficial layer of squamous epithelial cells that covers the entire embryo, including the oral cavity. Recent studies from human and animal models identified 19 genes that are essential for periderm development, and of these, 10 have DNA variation that causes or increases risk for orofacial clefting. Despite its significant role in palate development, little is known about periderm at the molecular level. The immediate goals of this proposal are to i) determine the gene regulatory network for periderm and ii) apply that new knowledge to identify alleles within the 24 associated loci that perturb the gene regulatory network for periderm. The longterm goals of this proposal are to identify genetic pathways that are essential for periderm differentiation and to identify the actual pathogenic DNA variants that perturb these pathways. This new knowledge will help determine recurrence risk and provide opportunities to develop new rational therapies. In particular, since periderm only exists in the embryo and since it is the most superficial layer of the embryo, it is an ideal target for in utero therapies, when and where orofacial clefting actually occurs. We have two parallel specific aims. In Aim 1 we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm differentiation in zebrafish by systematically perturbing the system. In Aim 2, we will use a parallel approach to determine the gene regulatory network for mouse periderm. It is essential to use both animal models because while studies of zebrafish periderm led to the identification of genes required for development of the lip and palate, the “periderm” between these two clades has a different embryonic origin and it is possible aspects of the gene regulatory network are different. Our project thus exploits the power and tractability of the zebrafish, and the human-like origin of periderm in the mouse. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,9783225,R56DE023575,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Dominant-Negative Mutation', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Palate', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Periderm', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Domains', 'RNA analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Transposase', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Zebrafish', 'clinically significant', 'differential expression', 'embryo tissue', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome sequencing', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'loss of function', 'member', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oral cavity epithelium', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'paralogous gene', 'prenatal therapy', 'promoter', 'rare condition', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R56,2018,339622,-0.003537289953108689
"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth in patients with refractory PA disease.",DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth,9580729,R01CA230328,"['Acromegaly', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dura Mater', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hypopituitarism', 'In Vitro', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Pituitary-dependent Cushing&apos', 's disease', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Publishing Peer Reviews', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Somatotropin', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'bone', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional status', 'genome-wide', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'methylome', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prognostic', 'small hairpin RNA', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,562135,-0.008674985038631676
"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways. In addition, besides the contribution to the specific neurobiology, the technologies are widely applicable to areas such as developmental cell biology, and to other small organisms such as fly larvae and zebrafish embryos. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Synapse development is an important and active area of research linking genes and environments to the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system.

"Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML No abstract available PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the bone marrow, where immature cells accumulate and disrupt the production of normal blood cells, disrupting normal blood formation and organ function. Despite advances in research, AML patients are typically treated with chemotherapy agents that often fail to cure them and frequently lead to relapse. We propose to create new therapies for repressing AML based on targeting the epigenome, or the pattern of chemical modification of DNA and histones, the proteins that package and order DNA to promote gene expression.",Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML,9681931,F31CA228331,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Apoptosis', 'Arginine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Modification Process', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Docking', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Synergism', 'Embryonic Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histones', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Bone Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Myelogenous', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Network-based', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Production', 'Protein Methyltransferases', 'Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'analog', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1', 'design', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F31,2018,49524,-0.0014673785936072088
"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects. Such patients exhibit unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. As motile cilia function is required both for airway mucus clearance and embryonic left-right patterning, we will develop functional assays and software to assess cilia candidate genes containing rare coding variants identified in heterodoxy patients for their role in airway cilia motility and left-right patterning of organ asymmetries.",Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning,9341016,R01GM104412,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cilia', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Embryo', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Frequency', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Handedness', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Knock-out', 'Left', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Situs Inversus', 'Structure', 'Structure of respiratory epithelium', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'Visceral', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'With laterality', 'Zebrafish', 'airway epithelium', 'cilium motility', 'congenital heart disorder', 'disease phenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'founder mutation', 'gene function', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research clinical testing', 'respiratory', 'software development', 'structural heart disease', 'tool', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,546200,0.042585578428487966
"Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity Project Summary Our overarching goal is to understand how information characterizing genes and their function can be organized, integrated, and then generalized to new contexts. This is a central question of the post-genomic era, and one that becomes ever more pressing as novel assays expand the scope, breadth, and detail of information describing gene properties. While the Gene Ontology is the most prominent and universal system for organizing gene function, hundreds of others exist, often serving specialized research interests. Most laboratories depend on the validity of some subset of this data to design new experiments or interpret their results, but their quality is hard to directly ascertain, particularly in novel or complex integrative methodologies. Based on substantial preliminary data, we hypothesize that determining robustness and specificity will provide a highly general assessment of the utility of databases. We propose to use these properties to assess the entire corpus of resources organizing gene information, as well as the methods which exploit this information, and the results that they report. Critically, determining robustness and specificity does not require validation with respect to ‘gold standard’ information. By evaluating these resources with respect to their joint specificity and robustness we determine means of integrating and organizing their data for use in novel applications. Finally, we propose to apply our improvements in quality control to better target rare but robust results where this is an experimental goal, notably rare diseases and single cell expression. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Determine the uniqueness and robustness of data characterizing gene function. We develop a formal approach for characterizing robustness and uniqueness/specificity by exploiting prior probability in the form of gene multifunctionality. We will evaluate robustness and specificity across essentially all complex and structured databases characterizing genes. These measures can be compared between databases or over time and provide a global landscape of data structure. 2. Test methods designed to exploit information describing gene function. Statistical and machine learning methods exploiting structured data will be assessed for robust and specific output. Data features driving performance in diverse applications will be identified and complementary sources of data as well as community clusters will be defined. 3. Evaluate results that depended on the use of databases describing gene function. Using a combination of text-mining and figure-mining, we will assess the ongoing literature for novel, robust, and specific gene-function associations. We will characterize and evaluate the “dark matter” of gene-function association from both the point of unannotated genes as well as incomplete functions. Project Narrative Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene function in many different contexts and this data is captured in numerous resources which catalogue the varied properties of genes. The primary goal of this project is to explore and characterize the specificity and robustness of information about gene function within these databases. Because most biomedical experiments build on pre-existing knowledge, establishing guidelines for interpreting that data also has a large impact on our ability to understand novel results, particularly where they are unusual, as in many rare diseases.",Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity,9425727,R01LM012736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'comparative', 'dark matter', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2017,464956,0.05579578193340326
"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. This knowledge can be further applied to understand disease mechanisms of cancers and guide personalized treatment of cancer patients.",Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium,9251894,R01LM012011,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Canes', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Encyclopedias', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'cancer genome', 'cancer subtypes', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'supercomputer', 'translational medicine', 'translational study']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,328031,0.06545428315907265
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9353372,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota transplantation', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,650808,0.027064799839876814
"Separating Wheat from Chaff in Major Depression Blood Biomarker Studies Project Summary Blood expression profiling of major depression disorder (MDD) patients has the potential to refine disease classification and diagnosis, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and improve drug targeting and clinical trial outcomes. However, the only significant finding in the largest MDD blood RNA study, a recent RNAseq profiling of 922 individuals comparing MDD patients with healthy controls, was a composite increase in the expression of genes associated with the interferon response pathway in MDD. Statistical analysis of such datasets is complicated by disease heterogeneity and by sources of inter-individual gene expression variation, such as high person-to-person differences in human blood cell type proportions, making it difficult to find measurements that robustly distinguish clinical groups. We have recently developed latent variable based computational approaches that more effectively model heterogeneity including blood proportions in blood gene expression data and that improve the identification of disease associated differentially expressed genes and disease-associated differences in cell type proportions. We have demonstrated that our methods increase the power to detect differentially expressed genes and improve agreement among separate studies of disease-associated global RNA expression. The latent variable framework we use can be exploited for interpreting the observed changes by attributing them to specific blood cell types. Preliminary analysis using these approaches on the large recent MDD RNAseq dataset finds evidence for additional depression related signatures and differentially expressed RNAs not detected by the original analysis. Analysis of the association of these signatures with acute symptoms and their stability over time in individuals suggests that they are most likely novel MDD trait markers. We will apply this enhanced methodology to identify novel MDD-associated genes in this large RNAseq dataset, confirm these signatures by analysis of other MDD public datasets, investigate the state/trait and genetic basis for these signatures and use machine learning to generate a purely clinical and biological data-driven classification of depression subgroups. This study is expected to result in an improved analysis framework for blood RNA biomarkers studies of psychiatric disease, significant new insight into MDD associated cell type proportion and blood gene expression trait signatures, and the identification of molecularly coherent depression subgroups. Project Narrative We have developed new computational methods that improve the ability to identify blood gene expression changes in genome-wide studies of blood in MDD. We will apply enhanced versions of these methods to investigate public MDD datasets.

"Predicting gene regulation across populations to understand mechanisms underlying complex traits Project Summary A better understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results and implicated genes across populations has implications for precision medicine and can only be accomplished by studying the genetic architecture of complex traits in diverse populations. For many complex traits, gene regulation is likely to play a crucial mechanistic role given the consistent enrichment of regulatory variants among trait-associated variants. We have developed a gene-level association method called PrediXcan that harnesses the regulatory knowledge generated by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies to directly test for genes associated with complex traits. An advantage of this gene-based approach over other aggregate variant approaches is that the results are inherently mechanistic and provide directionality, guiding follow-up experiments and future drug development. The genetic contribution to population phenotypic differentiation is driven by differences in causal allele frequencies, effect sizes, and genetic architectures. We propose to broaden the scope of PrediXcan to include diverse populations by (1) optimizing predictors of gene expression within and across diverse populations in multiple tissues and (2) performing gene-level association studies and quantifying regulability on a range of phenotypes in non-European populations. We will use machine learning to optimize predictive models of gene expression in datasets with both genome-wide genotype and gene expression data. We will integrate prior results from larger European populations when appropriate. Based on preliminary results, we expect a range of predictive power (assessed by cross-validation R2) will be observed across genes dependent on the heritability of each gene expression trait and differences in allele frequencies and effect sizes among populations. We will compare populations by 1) calculating the correlation between heritability estimates and cross-validated prediction performance and by 2) by calculating trans-population genetic effect size correlations (allele frequency independent) and trans-population genetic impact correlations (allele frequency dependent). The optimal models will also inform the underlying genetic architectures (sparse vs. polygenic) of gene expression traits and how they vary across populations. As we have done for European populations, the predictive models and heritability estimates developed here will be added to an open access database for use in PrediXcan and other studies. We hypothesize that PrediXcan will increase power to identify genes and implicate mechanisms underlying complex traits and that we can quantify the overall effect of phenotypic variation explained by transcriptome regulation within and across populations. We will compare gene-level results across populations to determine if the same and/or unique genes and pathways are implicated for a particular phenotype. We will estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance explained collectively by all gene expression levels, which we name the regulability of a trait. All results, scripts, and software will be available in publicly accessible databases and repositories. Project Narrative Differences in DNA sequence among individuals can lead to differences in gene expression levels, which in turn can lead to trait differences. We have developed a method that harnesses these DNA differences to predict gene expression levels, which are then tested for correlation with a disease or other trait of interest. Our project will lead to a better understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results and implicated genes across populations, which has the potential to improve the implementation of precision medicine among diverse populations and reduce health disparities.",Predicting gene regulation across populations to understand mechanisms underlying complex traits,9304684,R15HG009569,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological', 'Cholesterol', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'European', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Height', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'data access', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'interest', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'trait', 'transcriptome']",NHGRI,LOYOLA UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R15,2017,429000,0.026853493281941667
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9459529,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,400000,0.028249109242110878
"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular physiology and is likely to reveal a subset of proteins that should be advanced as targets for new therapeutic drugs.",Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome,9453342,U24DK116204,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'drug development', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knockout gene', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phosphoproteomics', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stable isotope', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2017,2308193,0.022583388024991293
"Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species Project Summary To begin unraveling the mysteries of the brain we must first understand its fundamental unit: the neuron. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have resulted in the rapid generation of high dimensional data for individual cells, revealing vast heterogeneity and enabling the prediction of novel cell subtypes based on expression patterns. In spite of this wealth of data, a theoretical framework to define subtype identity is lacking. Cross-laboratory expression analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to obtain robust and replicable results and we have previously shown that scRNA-seq data is readily amenable to gene co-expression meta-analysis. Here, we propose that these methods, in combination with cross-species analysis, will provide important validation of novel subtypes, and allow for the identification of new gene functional modules that drive neuronal diversity. Our overall hypothesis is that coordinated gene expression patterns underlie neuronal identity and function. The specific aims to address this hypothesis combine both computational and experimental approaches. First, we will characterize cell-type specific co-expression using RNA-seq data from bulk tissue and from single cells, defining best practices for network construction and identifying and characterizing gene modules that are unique to single cell data. Second, we will define a data- driven cell type taxonomy for the mouse and human nervous systems, and use this to identify neuronal subtype marker genes for validation with co-in situ hybridization and follow up with gene targeting and further scRNA-seq experiments. Finally, we will elucidate functional pathways that are unique to or conserved across species by comparing mouse and human neuronal subtype co-expression networks, with a particular focus on characterizing the cell type specific connectivity of psychiatric disease genes. These aims are consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's strategic plan to describe the molecules, cells and neural circuits associated with complex behaviors. As a result, these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of neuronal diversity and identity, leading to improved understanding of the molecular pathology of brain disorders. Project Narrative It has long been known that there are many different kinds of neurons that are involved in controlling brain activity. However, it is unclear precisely how many different types of neurons exist, and to what degree human neurons resemble those of other animals. In this project we propose that by combining information about the gene activity in both human and mouse neurons we will begin to put together a final `parts list' of the nervous system which we can use to understand brain disorders.",Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species,9395464,F32MH114501,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'molecular pathology', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,F32,2017,59166,-0.004820541861958273
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identifynovelcellsubtypesthroughchangesintheexpressionrelationshipsbetweengenes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expressionprofilesislikelytobenefitfromavarietyofapproaches.Inordertofindagreementbetweenthose approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9398289,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2017,472477,0.06599824426862483
"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9280975,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosomal location', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'synthetic genomics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,397299,0.02763920387343193
"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest. The technologies developed will have important implications for modeling human disease in animal systems.",Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function,9276155,R24OD020166,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Embryo', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene-Modified', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operating System', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transgenes', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'method development', 'mutant', 'nuclease', 'recombinase', 'repaired', 'site-specific integration', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'vector']",OD,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2017,706555,0.05914129974654523
"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems

and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of  information  from  the  NIH’s  ENCODE  project.  We  will  characterize  which  transcriptional  regulators  are  most  likely  responsible  for  perturbed  gene  expression,  their  signaling pathways and downstream targets. Previously unknown or understudied networks or genes identified

"Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures Project Summary/Abstract  The placenta is an essential organ in human development, and disruption of its function can result in problems in pregnancy including miscarriage, preterm labor, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Additionally, disrupted placenta function during pregnancy has been associated with a great number of disorders and diseases that do not present until much later in the offspring's life such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. How the exposures encountered in the environment drive alterations in placenta structure and function is poorly understood, and placenta function is difficult to assess in vivo using noninvasive methods. We propose to understand how gene expression is altered in the placenta during gestation by noninvasively characterizing the placenta transcriptome in association with exposure to chemicals known to alter endocrine signaling. These chemicals, called phthalates, are commonly found in a variety of commercial products such as plastics and personal care products, and phthalate exposure has also been shown to effect neurodevelopment. The link between phthalate exposure and placenta gene expression in vivo is not yet clear; therefore we have assembled a team comprised of neuroscientists, placenta biologists, environmental epidemiologists, and genomics experts do address how phthalate exposure and gestational age effects gene that are expressed in the placenta but not in other tissues. One of the advantages of the proposed research is that we will assess placenta gene expression noninvasively through RNA molecules contained in extracellular vesicles that are secreted into the urine of pregnant women. Collecting gene expression data and chemical exposure data from urine is highly clinically relevant, and we expect our approach will have clear translational applications just as home pregnancy tests that rely on the detection of placenta produced hormones in urine have become common. Our proposed study will provide the basic science background for the development of rapid, noninvasive tests for assessing placenta function, chemical exposures, and ultimately problems in neurodevelopment and other danger signals during pregnancy. Project Narrative  The proposed research will collect genome wide placenta gene expression data from 50 pregnant women at three time points during gestation. In addition to assessing gene expression differences the proposed research will develop methods to noninvasively determine placenta-originating transcripts among all transcripts existing in the urine of pregnant women. The proposed research will also compare gene expression to endocrine disrupting chemicals known to cause health problems.",Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures,9341310,R21ES027878,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Circulation', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Collection', 'Conceptus', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Placenta', 'Placental Biology', 'Placentation', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Tests', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Procedures', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Syncytiotrophoblast', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Uterine cavity', 'Villous', 'age effect', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytotrophoblast', 'design', 'developmental toxicology', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personal care products', 'phthalates', 'postnatal', 'prospective', 'response', 'study population', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2017,191131,0.05438634606742616
"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways. In addition, besides the contribution to the specific neurobiology, the technologies are widely applicable to areas such as developmental cell biology, and to other small organisms such as fly larvae and zebrafish embryos. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Synapse development is an important and active area of research linking genes and environments to the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system.

"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects. Such patients exhibit unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. As motile cilia function is required both for airway mucus clearance and embryonic left-right patterning, we will develop functional assays and software to assess cilia candidate genes containing rare coding variants identified in heterodoxy patients for their role in airway cilia motility and left-right patterning of organ asymmetries.",Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning,9118227,R01GM104412,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cilia', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Embryo', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Frequency', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Handedness', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Knock-out', 'Left', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Situs Inversus', 'Structure', 'Structure of respiratory epithelium', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'Visceral', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'With laterality', 'Zebrafish', 'airway epithelium', 'cilium motility', 'congenital heart disorder', 'disease phenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'founder mutation', 'gene function', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'software development', 'structural heart disease', 'tool', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,653850,0.042585578428487966
"Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. The RNAi technique is widely used in both biological research and clinical applications because it has the ability to knockdown essentially any gene of interest. However, one major unresolved issue in RNAi studies is non-specific gene silencing. It is well known that, in addition to the single intended gene target, many unintended targets are also simultaneously silenced. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new methods for improving RNAi specificity. RNAi specificity and potency are determined by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the silencing complex. We propose the hypothesis that gene silencing specificity can be significantly improved with rational siRNA design. We have previously developed a machine learning algorithm for the design of widely-distributed commercial siRNAs. Based on this commercial success, we propose to further develop a new method for genome-wide design of next-generation siRNAs with significantly reduced off-target effects. The new design method will lay a solid foundation for further commercial development of siRNA products that can be used in a variety of RNAi-based applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. RNAi has many diverse applications as it can suppress almost any human genes by recognizing the gene sequence. We propose to remove a major hurdle in RNAi studies by genome-wide design of siRNAs with significantly improved gene silencing specificity.",Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown,9146385,R41HG008567,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput RNA Sequencing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Process', 'RNA', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Sequence Analysis', 'RNA interference screen', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'biological research', 'clinical application', 'design', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'learning strategy', 'next generation', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,"NAWGEN, LLC",R41,2016,349932,0.04347941783310049
"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. This knowledge can be further applied to understand disease mechanisms of cancers and guide personalized treatment of cancer patients.",Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium,9042426,R01LM012011,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'abstracting', 'cancer genome', 'cancer subtypes', 'data mining', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'drug mechanism', 'drug sensitivity', 'environmental change', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'research study', 'response', 'supercomputer', 'translational medicine', 'translational study']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,328232,0.06545428315907265
"Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A holy grail of bioinformatics is the creation of whole-cell models with the ability to enhance human understanding and facilitate discovery. To this end, a successful and widely-used effort is the Gene Ontology (GO), a massive project to manually annotate genes into terms describing molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components and provide relationships between terms, e.g. capturing that ""small ribosomal subunit"" and ""large ribosomal subunit"" come together to make ""ribosome"". GO is widely used to understand the function of a gene or group of genes. Unfortunately, GO is limited by the effort required to create and update it by hand. It exists only for well-studied organisms and even then in only one, generic form per organism with limited overall genome coverage and a bias towards well-studied genes and functions. It is not possible to learn about an uncharacterized gene or discover a new function using GO, and one cannot quickly assemble an ontology model for a new organism, let alone a specific cell-type or disease-state.  This proposed research will change this state of affairs. Already, work has shown that large networks of gene and protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be used to computationally infer an ontology whose coverage and power are equivalent to those of the manually-curated GO Cellular Component ontology. Still, this first attempt was limited in the types of experimental data used and its ability to infer the more generally useful Biological Process ontology. Here machine learning approaches will be applied to integrate many types of experimental data into ontology model construction and analyze the type of biological information provided by each experiment, revealing those experiments most informative for capturing Biological Process information. Furthermore, the high-throughput experimental data to ontology paradigm explored here will be used to develop a computational tool to highlight novel types of hypotheses that are inaccessible by current high-throughput experimental data analysis methods.  Preliminary work has shown GO to be useful for prediction of synthetic lethal pairs of genes, i.e. genes that are individually non-essential but when knocked out together cause cell death. Given the high mutation rate in cancer, these pairs provide potential cancer drug targets, as a drug may target a gene product which is now essential in the mutated cancer cells but not other cells, thereby killing only cancer cells. Because data-driven ontologies are not as hindered by issues with bias and coverage and are specifically designed to capture only functional relationships, this proposal will explore the idea that data-driven ontologies will be better suited to help predict synthetic lethal pairs than GO. To this end, algorithms will be developed to construct a data-driven ontology of yeast DNA repair and use this ontology to predict synthetic lethal pairs of genes.  Overall, this proposal will develop the computational and experimental roadmap to construct a whole-cell model of gene function - an ontology - and use the model to discover useful biology - synthetic lethal pairs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, a new framework for using the results of commonly performed, genome-wide experiments has the potential to create whole-cell models of gene function, similar to the widely-used Gene Ontology, directly from data without manual intervention. This will allow creation of useful models of cells from different organisms, tissues and diseases which researchers can use to discover the function of unstudied genes and to uncover new functions performed by the cell. Furthermore, this proposal will use these models for the discovery of new cancer drug targets called synthetic lethal pairs of genes.            ",Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis,9145523,F30HG007618,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Processed Genes', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biological information processing', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental analysis', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'gene product', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'novel anticancer drug', 'prediction algorithm', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2016,48576,-0.0006790173885568671
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9136115,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,662793,0.027064799839876814
"Separating Wheat from Chaff in Major Depression Blood Biomarker Studies Project Summary Blood expression profiling of major depression disorder (MDD) patients has the potential to refine disease classification and diagnosis, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and improve drug targeting and clinical trial outcomes. However, the only significant finding in the largest MDD blood RNA study, a recent RNAseq profiling of 922 individuals comparing MDD patients with healthy controls, was a composite increase in the expression of genes associated with the interferon response pathway in MDD. Statistical analysis of such datasets is complicated by disease heterogeneity and by sources of inter-individual gene expression variation, such as high person-to-person differences in human blood cell type proportions, making it difficult to find measurements that robustly distinguish clinical groups. We have recently developed latent variable based computational approaches that more effectively model heterogeneity including blood proportions in blood gene expression data and that improve the identification of disease associated differentially expressed genes and disease-associated differences in cell type proportions. We have demonstrated that our methods increase the power to detect differentially expressed genes and improve agreement among separate studies of disease-associated global RNA expression. The latent variable framework we use can be exploited for interpreting the observed changes by attributing them to specific blood cell types. Preliminary analysis using these approaches on the large recent MDD RNAseq dataset finds evidence for additional depression related signatures and differentially expressed RNAs not detected by the original analysis. Analysis of the association of these signatures with acute symptoms and their stability over time in individuals suggests that they are most likely novel MDD trait markers. We will apply this enhanced methodology to identify novel MDD-associated genes in this large RNAseq dataset, confirm these signatures by analysis of other MDD public datasets, investigate the state/trait and genetic basis for these signatures and use machine learning to generate a purely clinical and biological data-driven classification of depression subgroups. This study is expected to result in an improved analysis framework for blood RNA biomarkers studies of psychiatric disease, significant new insight into MDD associated cell type proportion and blood gene expression trait signatures, and the identification of molecularly coherent depression subgroups. Project Narrative We have developed new computational methods that improve the ability to identify blood gene expression changes in genome-wide studies of blood in MDD. We will apply enhanced versions of these methods to investigate public MDD datasets.

"A web-based craniofacial disease gene discovery tool ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniofacial (CF) abnormalities constitute more than a third of all human structural birth defects. To define their genetic etiology, detailed molecular understanding is required of coordinated movement and fusion of embryonic facial prominences - as disruption of these morphogenetic events cause defects such as orofacial clefts (OFC). The NIH FaceBase initiative is an important step to address this need, as it aims to generate comprehensive whole-genome expression datasets using microarrays or Next-Gen RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on mouse embryonic CF tissue. However, genome-wide profiling identifies several thousand ""expressed"" genes and it is a formidable challenge to predict and prioritize the select few genes that are critical to tissue development or pathogenesis. We posit that although there is a wealth of genomic-level data available, this deficit remains because an adequate strategy has not yet been applied to identify these important candidate CF genes. We recently developed an innovative approach - termed in silico whole embryo body (WB) subtraction - to identify such important genes based on developmentally-enriched expression. We have applied this novel approach to ~15% of FaceBase data and assembled this knowledge as a user-friendly web-based interactive tool SysFACE (Systems tool for craniofacial expression-based gene discovery, http://bioinformatics.udel.edu/Research/SysFACE). Even with limited datasets, the beta version of SysFACE is significantly more effective, compared with unprocessed FaceBase datasets, in identification of known genes associated with OFCs from both linkage and GWAS studies. To process all existing FaceBase datasets, we will generate additional platform-specific WB reference datasets and evaluate these further with machine learning strategies to identify genes important to CF development (Aim 1). Subsequently, we aim to experimentally validate these tissue-enriched gene expression profiles, and to assemble this knowledge - along with a new evidence-based functional gene regulatory network (GRN) that will allow all molecular data from the CF published literature to be represented on systems level - as a user-friendly web-based interactive resource (Aim 2), which will also be made available through FaceBase. Development of SysFACE, as outlined in this application, will greatly improve prediction of candidate CF genes, provide an excellent resource for CF-network construction, and will facilitate CF gene discovery efforts by developmental biologists and clinicians. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Craniofacial malformations are common among structural birth defects among which orofacial clefts alone occur in 1/800 live-births and carry a lifetime cost for medical treatment, rehabilitation services and lost productivity of more than $100,000 per affected person. This application seeks to analyze FaceBase gene expression data using an integrated approach to develop a web-based user-friendly tool SysFACE - for both clinicians and scientists - that predicts and prioritizes craniofacial genes. SysFACE, available through FaceBase, will accelerate craniofacial disease gene discovery, which in turn will facilitate identification of new therapeutic approaches.",A web-based craniofacial disease gene discovery tool,9107846,R03DE024776,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye Development', 'Eye diseases', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Online Systems', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'System', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual Fields', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'data mining', 'evidence base', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene interaction', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'life time cost', 'microdeletion', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'orofacial cleft', 'rehabilitation service', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'web based interface', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R03,2016,192500,0.0798481319220127
"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.  The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013).     This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics. The team includes: Dr. Isaac Kohane, who is a Professor of Pediatrics, directs the Children's Hospital Informatics Program and leads an NLM-supported national center for biomedical computing; Dr. Ron Kikinis who is a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Dr. John Quackenbush, who is a Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.     During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies.     The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project. Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data.

"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9066171,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosomal location', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'empowered', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'promoter', 'research study', 'synthetic genomics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,397299,0.02763920387343193
"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest. The technologies developed will have important implications for modeling human disease in animal systems.",Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function,9151409,R24OD020166,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Embryo', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene-Modified', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operating System', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transgenes', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'cost', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'method development', 'mutant', 'nuclease', 'protein expression', 'recombinase', 'repaired', 'research study', 'site-specific integration', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'vector']",OD,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2016,759853,0.05914129974654523
"Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle (SMC) phenotypic modulation, the transition from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype accompanied by neointima formation following vascular injury, plays a critical role in the development and progression of several proliferative cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. The regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic modulation, however, are poorly understood. A hallmark feature of the phenotypic modulation is the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, down- regulates SMC gene expression and stimulates SMC proliferation via posttranscriptional regulation of the related genes. The post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in SMC phenotype gene expression, however, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data indicate that the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes is caused by abnormal RNA editing of their precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). This abnormal pre-mRNA editing is facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which converts adenosines to inosines (A->I editing). A-to-I RNA editing of the pre-mRNA transcripts from introns or 3'-untranslated regions alters pre- mRNA splicing, leading to decreased mature mRNA levels and abnormal cellular functions. PDGF-BB induces ADAR1 while down-regulating SMC myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and calponin (CNN). Knockdown of ADAR1 by shRNA restores PDGF-BB-blocked SMMHC and CNN expression, demonstrating that ADAR1 plays an essential role in SMC phenotype modulation. ADAR1 appears to be also important for PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation/survival. In vivo studies show that SMMHC and CNN pre-mRNA is accumulated when their mature mRNA is decreased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Moreover, ADAR1 is highly induced in media layer SMCs initially, and neointima SMCs subsequently following the injury. Of importance, knockdown of ADAR1 dramatically inhibits injury-induced neointima formation, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in vascular remodeling in vivo. These seminal findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that ADAR1/abnormal RNA editing mediates PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC contractile genes and SMC proliferation/survival, leading to SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) determine the role and mechanism whereby ADAR1 modulates SMC phenotype; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAR1 function in regulating SMC proliferation/survival; and 3) study the role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will unravel a novel mechanism governing SMC phenotypic modulation, which will ultimately lead to identification of novel targets for developing therapeuti agents to treat proliferative vascular diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in the United States. Transition of vascular smooth muscle (SMC) from a differentiated phenotype to a proliferative state accompanied by neointima formation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. In this application, a combination of molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches with gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies will be used to establish a novel mechanism underlying SMC phenotypic modulation. The completion of this project will advance our understanding of the fundamental pathologic mechanisms that contribute to the progression of aforementioned proliferative vascular diseases, and most importantly, lead to identification of important novel targets for developing therapeutic agents to treat these diseases.",Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling,8998053,R01HL119053,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'ADAR1', 'Adenosine', 'Angioplasty', 'Ants', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Cell physiology', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Contracts', 'DRADA2b protein', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypertension', 'Injury', 'Inosine', 'Introns', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'MYH11 gene', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Proliferation', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Veins', 'calponin', 'dsRNA adenosine deaminase', 'gain of function', 'genetic approach', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'knock-down', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Precursor', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neointima formation', 'novel', 'platelet-derived growth factor BB', 'protein expression', 'restenosis', 'small hairpin RNA', 'teration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2016,375000,0.030608773385328893
"Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures Project Summary/Abstract  The placenta is an essential organ in human development, and disruption of its function can result in problems in pregnancy including miscarriage, preterm labor, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Additionally, disrupted placenta function during pregnancy has been associated with a great number of disorders and diseases that do not present until much later in the offspring's life such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. How the exposures encountered in the environment drive alterations in placenta structure and function is poorly understood, and placenta function is difficult to assess in vivo using noninvasive methods. We propose to understand how gene expression is altered in the placenta during gestation by noninvasively characterizing the placenta transcriptome in association with exposure to chemicals known to alter endocrine signaling. These chemicals, called phthalates, are commonly found in a variety of commercial products such as plastics and personal care products, and phthalate exposure has also been shown to effect neurodevelopment. The link between phthalate exposure and placenta gene expression in vivo is not yet clear; therefore we have assembled a team comprised of neuroscientists, placenta biologists, environmental epidemiologists, and genomics experts do address how phthalate exposure and gestational age effects gene that are expressed in the placenta but not in other tissues. One of the advantages of the proposed research is that we will assess placenta gene expression noninvasively through RNA molecules contained in extracellular vesicles that are secreted into the urine of pregnant women. Collecting gene expression data and chemical exposure data from urine is highly clinically relevant, and we expect our approach will have clear translational applications just as home pregnancy tests that rely on the detection of placenta produced hormones in urine have become common. Our proposed study will provide the basic science background for the development of rapid, noninvasive tests for assessing placenta function, chemical exposures, and ultimately problems in neurodevelopment and other danger signals during pregnancy. Project Narrative  The proposed research will collect genome wide placenta gene expression data from 50 pregnant women at three time points during gestation. In addition to assessing gene expression differences the proposed research will develop methods to noninvasively determine placenta-originating transcripts among all transcripts existing in the urine of pregnant women. The proposed research will also compare gene expression to endocrine disrupting chemicals known to cause health problems.",Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures,9197555,R21ES027878,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Collection', 'Conceptus', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Tests', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Procedures', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Syncytiotrophoblast', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Uterine cavity', 'Villous', 'abstracting', 'age effect', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytotrophoblast', 'design', 'developmental toxicology', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personal care products', 'phthalates', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'response', 'study population', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2016,245727,0.05438634606742616
"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways. In addition, besides the contribution to the specific neurobiology, the technologies are widely applicable to areas such as developmental cell biology, and to other small organisms such as fly larvae and zebrafish embryos.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Synapse development is an important and active area of research linking genes and environments to the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system.

"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX.

"Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. The RNAi technique is widely used in both biological research and clinical applications because it has the ability to knockdown essentially any gene of interest. However, one major unresolved issue in RNAi studies is non-specific gene silencing. It is well known that, in addition to the single intended gene target, many unintended targets are also simultaneously silenced. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new methods for improving RNAi specificity. RNAi specificity and potency are determined by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the silencing complex. We propose the hypothesis that gene silencing specificity can be significantly improved with rational siRNA design. We have previously developed a machine learning algorithm for the design of widely-distributed commercial siRNAs. Based on this commercial success, we propose to further develop a new method for genome-wide design of next-generation siRNAs with significantly reduced off-target effects. The new design method will lay a solid foundation for further commercial development of siRNA products that can be used in a variety of RNAi-based applications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. RNAi has many diverse applications as it can suppress almost any human genes by recognizing the gene sequence. We propose to remove a major hurdle in RNAi studies by genome-wide design of siRNAs with significantly improved gene silencing specificity.            ",Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown,8978283,R41HG008567,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput RNA Sequencing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Process', 'RNA', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Sequence Analysis', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'biological research', 'clinical application', 'design', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'interest', 'next generation', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,"NAWGEN, LLC",R41,2015,246414,0.04347941783310049
"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. This knowledge can be further applied to understand disease mechanisms of cancers and guide personalized treatment of cancer patients.",Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium,8798024,R01LM012011,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'abstracting', 'cancer genome', 'data mining', 'design', 'drug mechanism', 'drug sensitivity', 'environmental change', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'research study', 'response', 'supercomputer', 'translational medicine', 'translational study']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,343551,0.06518060796973192
"Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A holy grail of bioinformatics is the creation of whole-cell models with the ability to enhance human understanding and facilitate discovery. To this end, a successful and widely-used effort is the Gene Ontology (GO), a massive project to manually annotate genes into terms describing molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components and provide relationships between terms, e.g. capturing that ""small ribosomal subunit"" and ""large ribosomal subunit"" come together to make ""ribosome"". GO is widely used to understand the function of a gene or group of genes. Unfortunately, GO is limited by the effort required to create and update it by hand. It exists only for well-studied organisms and even then in only one, generic form per organism with limited overall genome coverage and a bias towards well-studied genes and functions. It is not possible to learn about an uncharacterized gene or discover a new function using GO, and one cannot quickly assemble an ontology model for a new organism, let alone a specific cell-type or disease-state.  This proposed research will change this state of affairs. Already, work has shown that large networks of gene and protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be used to computationally infer an ontology whose coverage and power are equivalent to those of the manually-curated GO Cellular Component ontology. Still, this first attempt was limited in the types of experimental data used and its ability to infer the more generally useful Biological Process ontology. Here machine learning approaches will be applied to integrate many types of experimental data into ontology model construction and analyze the type of biological information provided by each experiment, revealing those experiments most informative for capturing Biological Process information. Furthermore, the high-throughput experimental data to ontology paradigm explored here will be used to develop a computational tool to highlight novel types of hypotheses that are inaccessible by current high-throughput experimental data analysis methods.  Preliminary work has shown GO to be useful for prediction of synthetic lethal pairs of genes, i.e. genes that are individually non-essential but when knocked out together cause cell death. Given the high mutation rate in cancer, these pairs provide potential cancer drug targets, as a drug may target a gene product which is now essential in the mutated cancer cells but not other cells, thereby killing only cancer cells. Because data-driven ontologies are not as hindered by issues with bias and coverage and are specifically designed to capture only functional relationships, this proposal will explore the idea that data-driven ontologies will be better suited to help predict synthetic lethal pairs than GO. To this end, algorithms will be developed to construct a data-driven ontology of yeast DNA repair and use this ontology to predict synthetic lethal pairs of genes.  Overall, this proposal will develop the computational and experimental roadmap to construct a whole-cell model of gene function - an ontology - and use the model to discover useful biology - synthetic lethal pairs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, a new framework for using the results of commonly performed, genome-wide experiments has the potential to create whole-cell models of gene function, similar to the widely-used Gene Ontology, directly from data without manual intervention. This will allow creation of useful models of cells from different organisms, tissues and diseases which researchers can use to discover the function of unstudied genes and to uncover new functions performed by the cell. Furthermore, this proposal will use these models for the discovery of new cancer drug targets called synthetic lethal pairs of genes.            ",Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis,8951600,F30HG007618,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Processed Genes', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biological information processing', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental analysis', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2015,39304,-0.0006790173885568671
"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells. The efficacy and biocompatibility (toxicity) of polymers and combination treatments will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo (in mice).",Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods,8786566,R01GM093229,"['Affinity', 'Amines', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Apoptosis', 'Biocompatible', 'Biodistribution', 'Cells', 'Combinatorial Synthesis', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA delivery', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Ethers', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transduction Agent', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Hydrophobicity', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Viral Vector', 'Phenotype', 'Plasmids', 'Polyamines', 'Polymers', 'Property', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'SCID Mice', 'Structure', 'TNFSF10 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes', 'Validation', 'Viral Vector', 'Xenograft Model', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'bone', 'cancer cell', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'combinatorial chemistry', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene therapy', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'luminescence', 'milligram', 'model design', 'monomer', 'multitask', 'nanoparticle', 'non-viral gene delivery', 'novel', 'prostate cancer cell', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'trafficking', 'transgene expression', 'vector', 'zeta potential']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2015,289337,0.046504165453213016
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,8928177,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'Cresols', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,673919,0.027064799839876814
"A web-based craniofacial disease gene discovery tool ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniofacial (CF) abnormalities constitute more than a third of all human structural birth defects. To define their genetic etiology, detailed molecular understanding is required of coordinated movement and fusion of embryonic facial prominences - as disruption of these morphogenetic events cause defects such as orofacial clefts (OFC). The NIH FaceBase initiative is an important step to address this need, as it aims to generate comprehensive whole-genome expression datasets using microarrays or Next-Gen RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on mouse embryonic CF tissue. However, genome-wide profiling identifies several thousand ""expressed"" genes and it is a formidable challenge to predict and prioritize the select few genes that are critical to tissue development or pathogenesis. We posit that although there is a wealth of genomic-level data available, this deficit remains because an adequate strategy has not yet been applied to identify these important candidate CF genes. We recently developed an innovative approach - termed in silico whole embryo body (WB) subtraction - to identify such important genes based on developmentally-enriched expression. We have applied this novel approach to ~15% of FaceBase data and assembled this knowledge as a user-friendly web-based interactive tool SysFACE (Systems tool for craniofacial expression-based gene discovery, http://bioinformatics.udel.edu/Research/SysFACE). Even with limited datasets, the beta version of SysFACE is significantly more effective, compared with unprocessed FaceBase datasets, in identification of known genes associated with OFCs from both linkage and GWAS studies. To process all existing FaceBase datasets, we will generate additional platform-specific WB reference datasets and evaluate these further with machine learning strategies to identify genes important to CF development (Aim 1). Subsequently, we aim to experimentally validate these tissue-enriched gene expression profiles, and to assemble this knowledge - along with a new evidence-based functional gene regulatory network (GRN) that will allow all molecular data from the CF published literature to be represented on systems level - as a user-friendly web-based interactive resource (Aim 2), which will also be made available through FaceBase. Development of SysFACE, as outlined in this application, will greatly improve prediction of candidate CF genes, provide an excellent resource for CF-network construction, and will facilitate CF gene discovery efforts by developmental biologists and clinicians.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Craniofacial malformations are common among structural birth defects among which orofacial clefts alone occur in 1/800 live-births and carry a lifetime cost for medical treatment, rehabilitation services and lost productivity of more than $100,000 per affected person. This application seeks to analyze FaceBase gene expression data using an integrated approach to develop a web-based user-friendly tool SysFACE - for both clinicians and scientists - that predicts and prioritizes craniofacial genes. SysFACE, available through FaceBase, will accelerate craniofacial disease gene discovery, which in turn will facilitate identification of new therapeutic approaches.                ",A web-based craniofacial disease gene discovery tool,8970355,R03DE024776,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye Development', 'Eye diseases', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Online Systems', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'RNA Sequences', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'System', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual Fields', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'data mining', 'evidence base', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lens', 'life time cost', 'microdeletion', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation service', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'web based interface']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R03,2015,282000,0.0798481319220127
"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.  The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013).     This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics.

During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes.

"Developing integrative approaches for identifying disease-causing genes and dysfunctional networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Cancer is a consequence of the accumulation of genetic alterations. Large whole-genome scale resequencing projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have been launched in an effort to comprehensively catalog the genomic mutations and epigenetic modifications that are associated with cancer. It is essential to identify cancer-causing genes and pathways to gain insight into the disease mechanisms and hence facilitate early diagnosis and optimal treatment. However, identifying cancer-causing genes and their functional pathways remains challenging due to the complex biological interactions and the heterogeneity of diseases. Genetic mutations in disease-causing genes can disturb signaling pathways that impact the expression of a set of genes performing certain biological functions. We refer to a set of such genes as a functional module. We hypothesize that driver mutations, that is, mutations that lead to cancer progression, are likely to affect common disease-associated functional modules, and the causal relationship between the mutations and the perturbed signals of the modules can be reconstructed from gene expression data and protein interaction data. In this project, we will develop a novel approach to infer disease-causing genes and networks by integrating information from multiple types of data including genomic variations, gene expression and protein interactions. We first dynamically identify disease-associated modules that consist of a set of interacting genes, then develop a Bayesian-based approach to infer causative genes from the disease-associated modules. Then, by developing a stochastic search based method, we can determine the paths connecting causative genes and gene modules. As a result, disease- related pathways are inferred from the paths. Furthermore, we will integrate those pathways with the human interactome to discover higher-level disease-associated networks. In addition, we will develop machine learning based classifiers to predict disease types and clinical outcomes utilizing the molecular signatures identified in this project, such as differentially expressed gene modules and causative genes. Our computational framework and classifiers will be made available to the research community via a webserver. The PI serves as the university bioinformatics program director and has extensive teaching and research experience. A goal of this project is also to provide scientific research training to students and o help students to gain biological insight through their involvement with the project. Students will learn practical scientific computing skills from the PI and develop their own computational approaches to solving specific biomedical problems under the guidance of the PI. Thus the project will serve as an effective learning-research model in bioinformatics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop and implement a novel framework to identify causative mutations and pathways and study cancer disease mechanisms by reconstructing signaling pathways. This will help to advance personalized medicine and lead to a greater understanding of cancer mechanisms, which can lay the foundation for improving early diagnosis and treatment planning, as well as the discovery of new therapeutic targets.            ",Developing integrative approaches for identifying disease-causing genes and dysfunctional networks,8880075,R15GM114739,"['Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Recurrent disease', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Universities', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer framework', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'prospective', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'scientific computing', 'skills', 'treatment planning', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT LITTLE ROCK,R15,2015,373520,0.06049039010474544
"ANALYSIS OF COMBINATORIAL CIS-REGULATION IN SYNTHETIC AND GENOMIC PROMOTER ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.            ",ANALYSIS OF COMBINATORIAL CIS-REGULATION IN SYNTHETIC AND GENOMIC PROMOTER,8888066,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'empowered', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,397299,0.02745315524198434
"Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle (SMC) phenotypic modulation, the transition from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype accompanied by neointima formation following vascular injury, plays a critical role in the development and progression of several proliferative cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. The regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic modulation, however, are poorly understood. A hallmark feature of the phenotypic modulation is the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, down- regulates SMC gene expression and stimulates SMC proliferation via posttranscriptional regulation of the related genes. The post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in SMC phenotype gene expression, however, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data indicate that the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes is caused by abnormal RNA editing of their precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). This abnormal pre-mRNA editing is facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which converts adenosines to inosines (A->I editing). A-to-I RNA editing of the pre-mRNA transcripts from introns or 3'-untranslated regions alters pre- mRNA splicing, leading to decreased mature mRNA levels and abnormal cellular functions. PDGF-BB induces ADAR1 while down-regulating SMC myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and calponin (CNN). Knockdown of ADAR1 by shRNA restores PDGF-BB-blocked SMMHC and CNN expression, demonstrating that ADAR1 plays an essential role in SMC phenotype modulation. ADAR1 appears to be also important for PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation/survival. In vivo studies show that SMMHC and CNN pre-mRNA is accumulated when their mature mRNA is decreased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Moreover, ADAR1 is highly induced in media layer SMCs initially, and neointima SMCs subsequently following the injury. Of importance, knockdown of ADAR1 dramatically inhibits injury-induced neointima formation, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in vascular remodeling in vivo. These seminal findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that ADAR1/abnormal RNA editing mediates PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC contractile genes and SMC proliferation/survival, leading to SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) determine the role and mechanism whereby ADAR1 modulates SMC phenotype; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAR1 function in regulating SMC proliferation/survival; and 3) study the role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will unravel a novel mechanism governing SMC phenotypic modulation, which will ultimately lead to identification of novel targets for developing therapeuti agents to treat proliferative vascular diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in the United States. Transition of vascular smooth muscle (SMC) from a differentiated phenotype to a proliferative state accompanied by neointima formation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. In this application, a combination of molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches with gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies will be used to establish a novel mechanism underlying SMC phenotypic modulation. The completion of this project will advance our understanding of the fundamental pathologic mechanisms that contribute to the progression of aforementioned proliferative vascular diseases, and most importantly, lead to identification of important novel targets for developing therapeutic agents to treat these diseases.",Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling,8794466,R01HL119053,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'ADAR1', 'Adenosine', 'Angioplasty', 'Ants', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Cell physiology', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Contracts', 'DRADA2b protein', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypertension', 'Injury', 'Inosine', 'Introns', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Smooth Muscle Myosins', 'Steno', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Proliferation', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Veins', 'calponin', 'dsRNA adenosine deaminase', 'gain of function', 'genetic approach', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Precursor', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neointima formation', 'novel', 'platelet-derived growth factor BB', 'protein expression', 'restenosis', 'small hairpin RNA', 'teration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2015,368349,0.030608773385328893
"Informatics Platform for Mammalian Gene Regulation at Isoform-level DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) Develop statistically rigorous novel algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop novel algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to estimate the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated. The novel bioinformatics methods developed by this project will help in silico discovery and research for accelerating the linkage of phenotypic and genomic information, at gene-isoform level. Public health relevance statement:  The disruption of numerous human genes and their isoforms driven by alternative splicing and alternative transcription is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism. The development of bioinformatics methods and user-friendly  software in this study will provide useful tools to better understand gene regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells, and more importantly, how dis-regulation of these mechanisms leads to a variety of diseases.",Informatics Platform for Mammalian Gene Regulation at Isoform-level,8843951,R01LM011297,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Arts', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Fertility', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secure', 'Signal Pathway', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'TP53 gene', 'TP73 gene', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Trees', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer initiation', 'cost', 'epigenomics', 'forest', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuropsychiatry', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web-accessible']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,337196,0.02550853029850172
"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods.

"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability. The research team will apply the proposed techniques to cancer research data analysis. The success of this project will be important in bridging statistical machine learning and cancer research.

"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects. Such patients exhibit unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. As motile cilia function is required both for airway mucus clearance and embryonic left-right patterning, we will develop functional assays and software to assess cilia candidate genes containing rare coding variants identified in heterodoxy patients for their role in airway cilia motility and left-right patterning of organ asymmetries.                ",Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning,8623176,R01GM104412,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cilia', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Embryo', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Handedness', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Knock-out', 'Left', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Situs Inversus', 'Structure', 'Structure of respiratory epithelium', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'Visceral', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'With laterality', 'Zebrafish', 'airway epithelium', 'cilium motility', 'congenital heart disorder', 'disease phenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'founder mutation', 'gene function', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'software development', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,573774,0.042585578428487966
"New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With recent biotechnology advances, biomedical investigations have become computationally more complex and more challenging, involving high-dimensional structured data collected at a genomic scale. To respond to the pressing need to analyze such high-dimensional data, the research team proposes to develop powerful statistical and computational tools to model and infer condition-specific gene networks through sparse and structured learning of multiple precision matrices, as for time-varying gene network analyses with microarray data. The approach will be generalized to regression analysis with covariates and to mixture models with phenotype heterogeneity, e.g., unknown disease subtypes.  Statistically, the team will investigate novel penalization or regularization approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency of estimating multiple large precision matrices describing pairwise partial correlations in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models. Computationally, innovative strategies will be explored based on the state-of-the art optimization techniques, particularly difference convex programming, augmented Lagrangian method, and the method of coordinate decent. Specific aims include: a) developing computational tools for inferring multiple precision matrices, especially when the size of a matrix greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing regression approaches for sparse as well as structured learning to associate partial correlations with covariates of interest; c) developing mixture models to infer gene disregulations in the presence of unknown disease subtypes, and to discover novel disease subtypes; d) applying the developed methods to analyze two microarray datasets for i) inference of condition-specific gene networks for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for human endothelial cells; e) developing public-domain software.

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by miRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.

"Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A holy grail of bioinformatics is the creation of whole-cell models with the ability to enhance human understanding and facilitate discovery. To this end, a successful and widely-used effort is the Gene Ontology (GO), a massive project to manually annotate genes into terms describing molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components and provide relationships between terms, e.g. capturing that ""small ribosomal subunit"" and ""large ribosomal subunit"" come together to make ""ribosome"". GO is widely used to understand the function of a gene or group of genes. Unfortunately, GO is limited by the effort required to create and update it by hand. It exists only for well-studied organisms and even then in only one, generic form per organism with limited overall genome coverage and a bias towards well-studied genes and functions. It is not possible to learn about an uncharacterized gene or discover a new function using GO, and one cannot quickly assemble an ontology model for a new organism, let alone a specific cell-type or disease-state.  This proposed research will change this state of affairs. Already, work has shown that large networks of gene and protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be used to computationally infer an ontology whose coverage and power are equivalent to those of the manually-curated GO Cellular Component ontology. Still, this first attempt was limited in the types of experimental data used and its ability to infer the more generally useful Biological Process ontology. Here machine learning approaches will be applied to integrate many types of experimental data into ontology model construction and analyze the type of biological information provided by each experiment, revealing those experiments most informative for capturing Biological Process information. Furthermore, the high-throughput experimental data to ontology paradigm explored here will be used to develop a computational tool to highlight novel types of hypotheses that are inaccessible by current high-throughput experimental data analysis methods.  Preliminary work has shown GO to be useful for prediction of synthetic lethal pairs of genes, i.e. genes that are individually non-essential but when knocked out together cause cell death. Given the high mutation rate in cancer, these pairs provide potential cancer drug targets, as a drug may target a gene product which is now essential in the mutated cancer cells but not other cells, thereby killing only cancer cells. Because data-driven ontologies are not as hindered by issues with bias and coverage and are specifically designed to capture only functional relationships, this proposal will explore the idea that data-driven ontologies will be better suited to help predict synthetic lethal pairs than GO. To this end, algorithms will be developed to construct a data-driven ontology of yeast DNA repair and use this ontology to predict synthetic lethal pairs of genes.  Overall, this proposal will develop the computational and experimental roadmap to construct a whole-cell model of gene function - an ontology - and use the model to discover useful biology - synthetic lethal pairs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, a new framework for using the results of commonly performed, genome-wide experiments has the potential to create whole-cell models of gene function, similar to the widely-used Gene Ontology, directly from data without manual intervention. This will allow creation of useful models of cells from different organisms, tissues and diseases which researchers can use to discover the function of unstudied genes and to uncover new functions performed by the cell. Furthermore, this proposal will use these models for the discovery of new cancer drug targets called synthetic lethal pairs of genes.            ",Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis,8644512,F30HG007618,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Processed Genes', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biological information processing', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental analysis', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2014,35110,-0.0006790173885568671
"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells.

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.            ",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,8817197,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'Cresols', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,727558,0.027064799839876814

During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies. The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project.  Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data. These advances will lead to the development of improved diagnostics for patients, allowing clinicians to more accurately predict the outcome of a patient's disease, leading to more effective individualized therapies.",INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY,8674406,K22LM011931,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Israel', 'K22 Award', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer cell', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical care', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medical schools', 'multitask', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'transcriptomics', 'translational medicine']",NLM,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K22,2014,170586,0.02526194764754504
"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle (SMC) phenotypic modulation, the transition from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype accompanied by neointima formation following vascular injury, plays a critical role in the development and progression of several proliferative cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. The regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic modulation, however, are poorly understood. A hallmark feature of the phenotypic modulation is the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, down- regulates SMC gene expression and stimulates SMC proliferation via posttranscriptional regulation of the related genes. The post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in SMC phenotype gene expression, however, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data indicate that the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes is caused by abnormal RNA editing of their precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). This abnormal pre-mRNA editing is facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which converts adenosines to inosines (A->I editing). A-to-I RNA editing of the pre-mRNA transcripts from introns or 3'-untranslated regions alters pre- mRNA splicing, leading to decreased mature mRNA levels and abnormal cellular functions. PDGF-BB induces ADAR1 while down-regulating SMC myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and calponin (CNN). Knockdown of ADAR1 by shRNA restores PDGF-BB-blocked SMMHC and CNN expression, demonstrating that ADAR1 plays an essential role in SMC phenotype modulation. ADAR1 appears to be also important for PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation/survival. In vivo studies show that SMMHC and CNN pre-mRNA is accumulated when their mature mRNA is decreased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Moreover, ADAR1 is highly induced in media layer SMCs initially, and neointima SMCs subsequently following the injury. Of importance, knockdown of ADAR1 dramatically inhibits injury-induced neointima formation, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in vascular remodeling in vivo. These seminal findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that ADAR1/abnormal RNA editing mediates PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC contractile genes and SMC proliferation/survival, leading to SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) determine the role and mechanism whereby ADAR1 modulates SMC phenotype; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAR1 function in regulating SMC proliferation/survival; and 3) study the role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will unravel a novel mechanism governing SMC phenotypic modulation, which will ultimately lead to identification of novel targets for developing therapeuti agents to treat proliferative vascular diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in the United States. Transition of vascular smooth muscle (SMC) from a differentiated phenotype to a proliferative state accompanied by neointima formation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. In this application, a combination of molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches with gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies will be used to establish a novel mechanism underlying SMC phenotypic modulation. The completion of this project will advance our understanding of the fundamental pathologic mechanisms that contribute to the progression of aforementioned proliferative vascular diseases, and most importantly, lead to identification of important novel targets for developing therapeutic agents to treat these diseases.            ",Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling,8653749,R01HL119053,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'ADAR1', 'Adenosine', 'Angioplasty', 'Ants', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Cell physiology', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Contracts', 'DRADA2b protein', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypertension', 'Injury', 'Inosine', 'Introns', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Smooth Muscle Myosins', 'Steno', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Proliferation', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Veins', 'calponin', 'dsRNA adenosine deaminase', 'gain of function', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Precursor', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neointima formation', 'novel', 'platelet-derived growth factor BB', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'restenosis', 'small hairpin RNA', 'teration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2014,372500,0.030608773385328893
"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

"Modeling MicroRNA-Target Functional Networks for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Prognosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of adult hematopoietic malignancy. It has a high rate of disease relapse, a consequence of chemoresistance. Recent biological studies suggest that a major component of the relapse phenotype resides in a rare population of leukemic stem cells (LSC), characterized by extensive proliferative and self-renewal potential, and poor response to standard chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesize that i) common molecular characteristics inherent to LSC-enriched populations reflect the biology of heterogeneous AML with unfavorable prognostic features; ii) these associations can be derived from systematic analysis of gene and microRNA expression profiles, and other biologic characteristics of bulk AML samples. The overarching goal of this project is to define LSC-characterized transcription factor (TF) and microRNA interactions in heterogeneous AMLs. We proposed to integrate both qualified data-driven and curated knowledge about LSC characteristics, and clinical outcomes from bulk AML. Specifically, we will perform meta-analyses on a pathway level to build LSC-specific biology, focusing on AML prognostic TF/microRNA deregulation. These approaches are supported by our two pioneering mathematical methodologies: the Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression (FAIME) and the mechanism-anchored Phenotypes-Genotype Network (PGNet). FAIME provides a novel process for transforming extensive available gene expression profiles into individual pathway profiles, resulting in more reproducible pathway signatures (46% overlap among three cohorts, empirical p<0.001). The PGNet method reveals genes regulated by disease-critical regulators and can accurately predict patient outcomes - shifting the paradigm from single gene/microRNA analysis towards ""mechanism anchored profiling"". Using PGNet, we have successfully predicted that the epigenetic regulator HDAC9 is associated with survival in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Innovatively, this project will interrogate microRNAs/genes that regulate LSC-specific biological pathways and AML prognostication, integrating regulator-regulator interactions and regulator-gene interactions. In Aim 1, we will build LSC-specific gene pathways and identify regulator-gene interactions. In Aim 2, we will correlate LSC-specific regulators and their target genes corresponding to AML outcomes. In Aim 3, we will develop novel approaches to computationally model the crucial interactions among the LSC-specific regulators and prognostic gene targets. Both the abundance of available AML patient profiles and the proven ability of our proposed methods suggest that we will achieve our aim to build an LSC-driven prognostic model.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have long been committed to the development of statistical algorithms and software tools for high-throughput data analyses (e.g. the Bioconductor package OrderedList, the online tools GOModule). These tools allow an effective functional integration of transcriptome information with clinical endpoints. This project will systematically build a pre-clinical model of the leukemic stem cell, a critical subpopulation in acute myeloid leukemia that integrates transcriptome, crucial microRNAs, targeting genes, and other biologic/clinical endpoints. This robust computational structure will facilitate predictions f outcomes and the identification of key oncogenic targets.            ",Modeling MicroRNA-Target Functional Networks for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Prognosis,8688175,R21CA167305,"['Accounting', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioconductor', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Karyotype', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Qualifying', 'Reading', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Translating', 'Yang', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'feeding', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cell', 'mathematical methods', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'stemness', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2014,166670,0.04335248591141283
"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.          Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response. To tackle these complex data types, we develop novel machine learning, network analysis, and database methods. Our personalized medicine approach will help researchers study and evaluate neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism.

"Informatics platform for mammalian gene regulation at isoform-level     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) Develop statistically rigorous novel algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop novel algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to estimate the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated. The novel bioinformatics methods developed by this project will help in silico discovery and research for accelerating the linkage of phenotypic and genomic information, at gene-isoform level.             Public health relevance statement:  The disruption of numerous human genes and their isoforms driven by alternative splicing and alternative transcription is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism.

"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability. The research team will apply the proposed techniques to cancer research data analysis.

"New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With recent biotechnology advances, biomedical investigations have become computationally more complex and more challenging, involving high-dimensional structured data collected at a genomic scale. To respond to the pressing need to analyze such high-dimensional data, the research team proposes to develop powerful statistical and computational tools to model and infer condition-specific gene networks through sparse and structured learning of multiple precision matrices, as for time-varying gene network analyses with microarray data. The approach will be generalized to regression analysis with covariates and to mixture models with phenotype heterogeneity, e.g., unknown disease subtypes.  Statistically, the team will investigate novel penalization or regularization approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency of estimating multiple large precision matrices describing pairwise partial correlations in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models. Computationally, innovative strategies will be explored based on the state-of-the art optimization techniques, particularly difference convex programming, augmented Lagrangian method, and the method of coordinate decent. Specific aims include: a) developing computational tools for inferring multiple precision matrices, especially when the size of a matrix greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing regression approaches for sparse as well as structured learning to associate partial correlations with covariates of interest; c) developing mixture models to infer gene disregulations in the presence of unknown disease subtypes, and to discover novel disease subtypes; d) applying the developed methods to analyze two microarray datasets for i) inference of condition-specific gene networks for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for human endothelial cells; e) developing public-domain software.        This proposed research is expected not only to contribute valuable analysis tools for the elucidation of condition-specific gene networks, but also to advance statistical methodology and theory in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models for high-dimensional data.

"Computational Methods for Expression Image Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in high-throughput bio-imaging technologies are enabling scientists to capture the spatio- temporal patterns of gene expression in cells, organs and individuals in efforts to generate a more comprehensive picture of genome function. Today, images capturing gene expression and protein localization patterns have unprecedented spatial resolution, resulting in high-quality maps (expression images) in model organisms. However, computational biology of gene expression patterns lags far behind genome informatics. Automated and efficient tools for analyzing expression images are a prerequisite for generating biological insights into gene functions, interactions and networks for the next generation of scientists. This project focuses on the development of novel tools and techniques for large-scale biological annotation and comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of a model organism (Drosophila melanogaster; the fruit fly). This choice is important because the fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals. The availability of >100,000 images that capture gene expression patterns, provides an opportunity to examine the similarities and differences in the expression of the developing embryos of fruit fly genes, many of which show a very high sequence and biochemical function similarity to humans proteins. Three primary aims of the proposed research are as follows: (a) Develop machine learning methods that will use the existing, but coarse, knowledge in training, and will produce refined and new stage information for existing and future images. The knowledge of the precise developmental stage is important because it enables the biologically-meaningful mining of genes with similar spatial patterns, calculating the developmental trajectories of gene expressions, facilitating stage-sensitive textual annotation of expressions captured in images, and building genome-wide expression pattern maps at critical junctures in development. (b) Develop machine learning methods to describe expression patterns in words by using the existing controlled vocabulary. These descriptions will enable the use of efficient text-mining tools to identify genes expressed in similar organs and their precursors. These descriptions will also provide a better comparison of expression patterns across species, because many efforts in the scientific community relate organism specific controlled vocabularies with each other. (c) Develop transfer learning techniques for stage and text annotation that can be used for images generated from future techniques. This is important because traditionally, machine learning approaches assume that the training data and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, new bio-imaging techniques are producing higher resolution data with substantially different color and intensity distributions, and robust methods that apply across techniques are desired.           Project Narrative This project focuses on the analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster. This fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals. The proposed research will explicate the function and interconnection of animal genes and lead to a better understanding of human diseases.",Computational Methods for Expression Image Analysis,8502758,R01LM010730,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'comparative', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'insight', 'next generation', 'novel', 'spatiotemporal', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vision development']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2013,291834,0.06663810943100949
"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1. Software engineering, testing, and documentation of the HyPhy codebase. 2. The development of a high-performance engine for phylogenetic maximum likelihood model fitting and inference. 3. Extension of a newly-initiated toolbox for machine learning applications in molecular evolution. 4. Creation and maintenance of a wiki-themed documentation resource.

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by miRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells. The efficacy and biocompatibility (toxicity) of polymers and combination treatments will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo (in mice).

"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Context-Sensitive Search of Human Expression Compendia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression experiments are an abundant and robust source of functional genomics data, with thousands of microarray and a growing number of high throughput RNA sequencing studies publicly available, most interrogating clinical and biological systems relevant to disease. They hold the promise of data-driven characterization of gene function and regulation, including in specific tissues, cell lines, and disease states, and can advance the understanding and modeling of regulatory changes that form the basis of human disease. However, these data remain largely underutilized, as biology researchers do not have effective tools to explore and analyze the entire data collection to generate novel hypotheses and direct experiments. The situation is similar to that of the Internet before the search engines - a biology researcher has to know a priori which datasets pertain to the biological question she is asking, reflect the tissue/cell-lineage specific signals of interest to her, and accurately measure the expression of genes related to her pathways of interest. There is a clear need for methods that will enable biology researchers to use their domain-specific knowledge to direct their exploration of public human expression data, enabling them to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing challenging biomedical questions. Such a system should provide users with ability to effectively explore automatically identified datasets relevant to their biological question of interest, leverage metazoan complexity including cell lineage and disease specific signals, and allow the researcher to securely include their unpublished data in the analysis. To address these challenges, this proposal describes a ""Google-style"" public search engine for large collections of gene expression data built using novel search algorithms and leveraging cloud-computing technologies. This system implements a novel query-based context-sensitive algorithm for search of large expression compendia that exploits the complexity of metazoan organisms, including cell-lineage complexity and disease aspects inherent to human expression studies. Furthermore, the challenge of heterogeneity in human samples will be addressed by developing novel hierarchical learning methods to predict cell-lineage or tissue-specific gene expression based on the compendium and to identify these signals in each dataset. This will enable users to explore tissue-specific expression and also will be integrated with the search algorithm to improve search accuracy. Proposed algorithms, search engine, and user interface will be extensively evaluated in close collaboration with biology researchers, and top predictions will be tested experimentally. These methods will be implemented in a user-friendly public search system that will leverage cloud computing to provide robust interactive query response and will enable biology researchers to explore both published data collections and their own pre-publication datasets in a context-specific, integrated, and secure manner.        We will develop a ""Google-style"" search engine for massive collections of human gene expression data. Our system will enable researchers to use their domain knowledge to explore the entirety of public human expression data to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing a diverse range of challenging biomedical questions. Public availability of our system will advance genome-level understanding of human biology and facilitate development of novel drugs, therapies, and personalized medical treatments.

"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

"Modeling MicroRNA-Target Functional Networks for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Prognosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of adult hematopoietic malignancy. It has a high rate of disease relapse, a consequence of chemoresistance. Recent biological studies suggest that a major component of the relapse phenotype resides in a rare population of leukemic stem cells (LSC), characterized by extensive proliferative and self-renewal potential, and poor response to standard chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesize that i) common molecular characteristics inherent to LSC-enriched populations reflect the biology of heterogeneous AML with unfavorable prognostic features; ii) these associations can be derived from systematic analysis of gene and microRNA expression profiles, and other biologic characteristics of bulk AML samples. The overarching goal of this project is to define LSC-characterized transcription factor (TF) and microRNA interactions in heterogeneous AMLs. We proposed to integrate both qualified data-driven and curated knowledge about LSC characteristics, and clinical outcomes from bulk AML. Specifically, we will perform meta-analyses on a pathway level to build LSC-specific biology, focusing on AML prognostic TF/microRNA deregulation. These approaches are supported by our two pioneering mathematical methodologies: the Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression (FAIME) and the mechanism-anchored Phenotypes-Genotype Network (PGNet). FAIME provides a novel process for transforming extensive available gene expression profiles into individual pathway profiles, resulting in more reproducible pathway signatures (46% overlap among three cohorts, empirical p<0.001). The PGNet method reveals genes regulated by disease-critical regulators and can accurately predict patient outcomes - shifting the paradigm from single gene/microRNA analysis towards ""mechanism anchored profiling"". Using PGNet, we have successfully predicted that the epigenetic regulator HDAC9 is associated with survival in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Innovatively, this project will interrogate microRNAs/genes that regulate LSC-specific biological pathways and AML prognostication, integrating regulator-regulator interactions and regulator-gene interactions. In Aim 1, we will build LSC-specific gene pathways and identify regulator-gene interactions. In Aim 2, we will correlate LSC-specific regulators and their target genes corresponding to AML outcomes. In Aim 3, we will develop novel approaches to computationally model the crucial interactions among the LSC-specific regulators and prognostic gene targets. Both the abundance of available AML patient profiles and the proven ability of our proposed methods suggest that we will achieve our aim to build an LSC-driven prognostic model.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have long been committed to the development of statistical algorithms and software tools for high-throughput data analyses (e.g. the Bioconductor package OrderedList, the online tools GOModule). These tools allow an effective functional integration of transcriptome information with clinical endpoints. This project will systematically build a pre-clinical model of the leukemic stem cell, a critical subpopulation in acute myeloid leukemia that integrates transcriptome, crucial microRNAs, targeting genes, and other biologic/clinical endpoints. This robust computational structure will facilitate predictions f outcomes and the identification of key oncogenic targets.            ",Modeling MicroRNA-Target Functional Networks for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Prognosis,8583454,R21CA167305,"['Accounting', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioconductor', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Karyotype', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Qualifying', 'Reading', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Translating', 'Yang', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'feeding', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cell', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'stemness', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2013,203415,0.04335248591141283
"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.          Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response. To tackle these complex data types, we develop novel machine learning, network analysis, and database methods. Our personalized medicine approach will help researchers study and evaluate neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism.

"Informatics platform for mammalian gene regulation at isoform-level     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) Develop statistically rigorous novel algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop novel algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to estimate the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated.

"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability. The research team will apply the proposed techniques to cancer research data analysis. The success of this project will be important in bridging statistical machine learning and cancer research.

"New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With recent biotechnology advances, biomedical investigations have become computationally more complex and more challenging, involving high-dimensional structured data collected at a genomic scale. To respond to the pressing need to analyze such high-dimensional data, the research team proposes to develop powerful statistical and computational tools to model and infer condition-specific gene networks through sparse and structured learning of multiple precision matrices, as for time-varying gene network analyses with microarray data. The approach will be generalized to regression analysis with covariates and to mixture models with phenotype heterogeneity, e.g., unknown disease subtypes.  Statistically, the team will investigate novel penalization or regularization approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency of estimating multiple large precision matrices describing pairwise partial correlations in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models. Computationally, innovative strategies will be explored based on the state-of-the art optimization techniques, particularly difference convex programming, augmented Lagrangian method, and the method of coordinate decent. Specific aims include: a) developing computational tools for inferring multiple precision matrices, especially when the size of a matrix greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing regression approaches for sparse as well as structured learning to associate partial correlations with covariates of interest; c) developing mixture models to infer gene disregulations in the presence of unknown disease subtypes, and to discover novel disease subtypes; d) applying the developed methods to analyze two microarray datasets for i) inference of condition-specific gene networks for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for human endothelial cells; e) developing public-domain software.

"Computational Methods for Expression Image Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in high-throughput bio-imaging technologies are enabling scientists to capture the spatio- temporal patterns of gene expression in cells, organs and individuals in efforts to generate a more comprehensive picture of genome function. Today, images capturing gene expression and protein localization patterns have unprecedented spatial resolution, resulting in high-quality maps (expression images) in model organisms. However, computational biology of gene expression patterns lags far behind genome informatics. Automated and efficient tools for analyzing expression images are a prerequisite for generating biological insights into gene functions, interactions and networks for the next generation of scientists. This project focuses on the development of novel tools and techniques for large-scale biological annotation and comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of a model organism (Drosophila melanogaster; the fruit fly). This choice is important because the fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals. The availability of >100,000 images that capture gene expression patterns, provides an opportunity to examine the similarities and differences in the expression of the developing embryos of fruit fly genes, many of which show a very high sequence and biochemical function similarity to humans proteins. Three primary aims of the proposed research are as follows: (a) Develop machine learning methods that will use the existing, but coarse, knowledge in training, and will produce refined and new stage information for existing and future images. The knowledge of the precise developmental stage is important because it enables the biologically-meaningful mining of genes with similar spatial patterns, calculating the developmental trajectories of gene expressions, facilitating stage-sensitive textual annotation of expressions captured in images, and building genome-wide expression pattern maps at critical junctures in development. (b) Develop machine learning methods to describe expression patterns in words by using the existing controlled vocabulary. These descriptions will enable the use of efficient text-mining tools to identify genes expressed in similar organs and their precursors. These descriptions will also provide a better comparison of expression patterns across species, because many efforts in the scientific community relate organism specific controlled vocabularies with each other. (c) Develop transfer learning techniques for stage and text annotation that can be used for images generated from future techniques. This is important because traditionally, machine learning approaches assume that the training data and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, new bio-imaging techniques are producing higher resolution data with substantially different color and intensity distributions, and robust methods that apply across techniques are desired.           Project Narrative This project focuses on the analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster. This fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals.

"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1. Software engineering, testing, and documentation of the HyPhy codebase. 2. The development of a high-performance engine for phylogenetic maximum likelihood model fitting and inference. 3. Extension of a newly-initiated toolbox for machine learning applications in molecular evolution. 4. Creation and maintenance of a wiki-themed documentation resource.

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by miRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells. The efficacy and biocompatibility (toxicity) of polymers and combination treatments will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo (in mice).

"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response.

"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Context-Sensitive Search of Human Expression Compendia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression experiments are an abundant and robust source of functional genomics data, with thousands of microarray and a growing number of high throughput RNA sequencing studies publicly available, most interrogating clinical and biological systems relevant to disease. They hold the promise of data-driven characterization of gene function and regulation, including in specific tissues, cell lines, and disease states, and can advance the understanding and modeling of regulatory changes that form the basis of human disease. However, these data remain largely underutilized, as biology researchers do not have effective tools to explore and analyze the entire data collection to generate novel hypotheses and direct experiments. The situation is similar to that of the Internet before the search engines - a biology researcher has to know a priori which datasets pertain to the biological question she is asking, reflect the tissue/cell-lineage specific signals of interest to her, and accurately measure the expression of genes related to her pathways of interest. There is a clear need for methods that will enable biology researchers to use their domain-specific knowledge to direct their exploration of public human expression data, enabling them to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing challenging biomedical questions. Such a system should provide users with ability to effectively explore automatically identified datasets relevant to their biological question of interest, leverage metazoan complexity including cell lineage and disease specific signals, and allow the researcher to securely include their unpublished data in the analysis. To address these challenges, this proposal describes a ""Google-style"" public search engine for large collections of gene expression data built using novel search algorithms and leveraging cloud-computing technologies. This system implements a novel query-based context-sensitive algorithm for search of large expression compendia that exploits the complexity of metazoan organisms, including cell-lineage complexity and disease aspects inherent to human expression studies. Furthermore, the challenge of heterogeneity in human samples will be addressed by developing novel hierarchical learning methods to predict cell-lineage or tissue-specific gene expression based on the compendium and to identify these signals in each dataset. This will enable users to explore tissue-specific expression and also will be integrated with the search algorithm to improve search accuracy. Proposed algorithms, search engine, and user interface will be extensively evaluated in close collaboration with biology researchers, and top predictions will be tested experimentally. These methods will be implemented in a user-friendly public search system that will leverage cloud computing to provide robust interactive query response and will enable biology researchers to explore both published data collections and their own pre-publication datasets in a context-specific, integrated, and secure manner.        We will develop a ""Google-style"" search engine for massive collections of human gene expression data. Our system will enable researchers to use their domain knowledge to explore the entirety of public human expression data to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing a diverse range of challenging biomedical questions. Public availability of our system will advance genome-level understanding of human biology and facilitate development of novel drugs, therapies, and personalized medical treatments.

"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health. n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,8197396,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2012,306196,0.060631515460402775
"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach Project Summary/Abstract We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semi- systematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health The interplay between the gene expression machinery and the compaction of genetic material into chromatin is now recognized as highly dynamic and complex. These processes must be tightly controlled for normal cellular physiology and to prevent disease states such as cancer. We will use a systems approach to genetically dissect the structural and functional relationships between the highly conserved components of these pathways in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, in order to more easily understand and eventually manipulate the vast complexity of human cells. n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,8258763,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histone H4', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'prevent', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2012,438425,0.008293613086579759
"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging.

"New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With recent biotechnology advances, biomedical investigations have become computationally more complex and more challenging, involving high-dimensional structured data collected at a genomic scale. To respond to the pressing need to analyze such high-dimensional data, the research team proposes to develop powerful statistical and computational tools to model and infer condition-specific gene networks through sparse and structured learning of multiple precision matrices, as for time-varying gene network analyses with microarray data. The approach will be generalized to regression analysis with covariates and to mixture models with phenotype heterogeneity, e.g., unknown disease subtypes.  Statistically, the team will investigate novel penalization or regularization approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency of estimating multiple large precision matrices describing pairwise partial correlations in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models. Computationally, innovative strategies will be explored based on the state-of-the art optimization techniques, particularly difference convex programming, augmented Lagrangian method, and the method of coordinate decent. Specific aims include: a) developing computational tools for inferring multiple precision matrices, especially when the size of a matrix greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing regression approaches for sparse as well as structured learning to associate partial correlations with covariates of interest; c) developing mixture models to infer gene disregulations in the presence of unknown disease subtypes, and to discover novel disease subtypes; d) applying the developed methods to analyze two microarray datasets for i) inference of condition-specific gene networks for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for human endothelial cells; e) developing public-domain software.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed research is expected not only to contribute valuable analysis tools for the elucidation of condition-specific gene networks, but also to advance statistical methodology and theory in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models for high-dimensional data.           This proposed research is expected not only to contribute valuable analysis tools for the elucidation of condition-specific gene networks, but also to advance statistical methodology and theory in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models for high-dimensional data.         ",New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data,8101478,R01GM081535,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Escherichia coli', 'Floods', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Group Structure', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Phenotype', 'Public Domains', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disorder subtype', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'programs', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2011,290523,0.04328076191075437
"Computational Methods for Expression Image Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in high-throughput bio-imaging technologies are enabling scientists to capture the spatio- temporal patterns of gene expression in cells, organs and individuals in efforts to generate a more comprehensive picture of genome function. Today, images capturing gene expression and protein localization patterns have unprecedented spatial resolution, resulting in high-quality maps (expression images) in model organisms. However, computational biology of gene expression patterns lags far behind genome informatics. Automated and efficient tools for analyzing expression images are a prerequisite for generating biological insights into gene functions, interactions and networks for the next generation of scientists. This project focuses on the development of novel tools and techniques for large-scale biological annotation and comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of a model organism (Drosophila melanogaster; the fruit fly). This choice is important because the fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals. The availability of >100,000 images that capture gene expression patterns, provides an opportunity to examine the similarities and differences in the expression of the developing embryos of fruit fly genes, many of which show a very high sequence and biochemical function similarity to humans proteins. Three primary aims of the proposed research are as follows: (a) Develop machine learning methods that will use the existing, but coarse, knowledge in training, and will produce refined and new stage information for existing and future images. The knowledge of the precise developmental stage is important because it enables the biologically-meaningful mining of genes with similar spatial patterns, calculating the developmental trajectories of gene expressions, facilitating stage-sensitive textual annotation of expressions captured in images, and building genome-wide expression pattern maps at critical junctures in development. (b) Develop machine learning methods to describe expression patterns in words by using the existing controlled vocabulary. These descriptions will enable the use of efficient text-mining tools to identify genes expressed in similar organs and their precursors. These descriptions will also provide a better comparison of expression patterns across species, because many efforts in the scientific community relate organism specific controlled vocabularies with each other. (c) Develop transfer learning techniques for stage and text annotation that can be used for images generated from future techniques. This is important because traditionally, machine learning approaches assume that the training data and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, new bio-imaging techniques are producing higher resolution data with substantially different color and intensity distributions, and robust methods that apply across techniques are desired.           Project Narrative This project focuses on the analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster. This fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals.

"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1. Software engineering, testing, and documentation of the HyPhy codebase. 2. The development of a high-performance engine for phylogenetic maximum likelihood model fitting and inference. 3. Extension of a newly-initiated toolbox for machine learning applications in molecular evolution. 4.

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by miRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: MicroRNAs are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single microRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets.

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells.

"Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Funding is sought for a five year mentored training period at Brown University for Dr. Nicola Neretti to transition from physics to independent investigator in computational biology. The candidate has a Physics PhD from Brown University, and has been working in the field of signal processing and machine learning. During the past year he has been part of a collaborative project with Dr. John Sedivy (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry) which resulted in a published paper about the analysis of gene expression array data to target c-Myc-activated genes with a correlation-based method. He has established other productive collaborations with members of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology (CCMB) at Brown University. The principal mentor will be Dr. Marc Tatar (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). The secondary mentors will be Dr. Charles Lawrence (Dep. Applied Mathematics) and Dr. John  Sedivy. The work plan for the five years is to split the training/research effort evenly between computation and biology. For the training requirements the candidate plans to attend courses and workshops in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related fields. Dr. Neretti also plans to complete lab rotations in the laboratory of Dr. Marc Tatar and Dr. John Sedivy, to acquire first hand experience in generating the biological data he will later analyze. The main focus of the research effort will be to use microarray data in time course experiments with a high temporal resolution to elucidate the complex interactions among genes and develop novel analytic techniques in functional genomic. In particular, the candidate proposes to integrate the results of gene clustering/graph analysis (e.g. correlation and tagged correlation based clustering) obtained from the time course data with the information available in genetic/pathway databases relevant to the process of senescence. This will allow the evaluation of given hypotheses about functional relationships among genes and the identification of novel dependencies, which can then be directly tested via experiments in model systems of aging. By using this approach the candidate proposes to address key questions in aging research such as what transcriptional changes are under the control of a nutrient sensing system, the temporal and hierarchical relationship of these changes, the magnitude of change that is biologically relevant, and whether genes within a functional metabolic network are co-regulated at the transcriptional level.                   n/a",Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging,8113231,K25AG028753,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ecology', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Funding Applicant', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Homologous Gene', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nutrient', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detection of nutrient', 'dietary restriction', 'experience', 'fly', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'insulin signaling', 'member', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'senescence']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K25,2011,119416,0.02089298805000087
"Rewiring the yeast brain:  Redundancy and interference in genetic networks    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)   Abstract: Similar to neural networks in animals, molecular networks in cells can generate bistable or oscillatory dynamics that maintain memories of previous events (e.g. epigenetic switch) or order periodic events (e.g. cell cycle), respectively. In cells, networks of genes interacting with one another through regulatory feedback implement such dynamics. Analogous to learning in brains, cells can """"learn"""" correlations in their environmental signals by encoding such correlations into their gene network dynamics through mutation, a """"re-wiring"""" process that occurs on the timescale of generations. The issue of learning the statistical regularities and correlations of environmental signals is best exemplified by the evolution of """"circadian clocks"""", which are oscillatory gene circuits that have learned to internalize the 24-hour light-dark circadian cycle. Strikingly, circadian clocks have evolved independently multiple times, which suggests there exists some selection pressure and/or evolutionary mechanism that repeatedly favor the convergent evolution of autonomous oscillation. The hypothesis of my research proposal is that certain types of loss-of-function mutations in duplicated genes (known as dominant-negative mutations) can easily generate bistability and oscillation in existing regulatory networks. Gene duplication followed by a loss-of-function mutation can generate a dominant-negative. A dominant negative mutation is a partial loss-of-function mutation that renders a gene duplicate functionally inactive, yet still capable of interacting with the original duplicate, the upstream effectors, and/or downstream targets. Thus, dominant-negatives can easily interfere with the proper regulation and activity of the original duplicate. Because both gene duplication and loss-of-function mutations occur frequently in evolution, this presents an evolutionary mechanism for rapidly generating bistability and autonomous oscillation in gene regulatory networks. My proposed research over the next five years will integrate experiment and theory to understand the extent to which gene duplication and dominant-negative mutations facilitate the evolution of epigenetic switches and circadian clocks in regulatory networks. We will use computer simulation and an experimental directed evolution approach in a tractable, model eukaryote (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to test the ability of cells to learn the statistical regularities of their coupled environmental signals. Understanding how and why single-cell microbes and parasites have learned to predict their environment is essential for understanding their future evolution to changing host conditions.   Public Health Relevance: The ability of parasites to learn and adapt to changing host conditions and environments presents a challenge to human health. The objective of my research proposal is to understand the capacity of gene networks in single cells to learn and predict the statistical regularities of their environment. Discovering the limitations and abilities of parasites to evolve and anticipate changes in their host environment will be invaluable for the treatment of many human diseases.       n/a",Rewiring the yeast brain:  Redundancy and interference in genetic networks,8146626,DP2OD008654,"['Animals', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Dominant-Negative Mutation', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Parasites', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Yeasts', 'abstracting', 'brain cell', 'circadian pacemaker', 'directed evolution', 'duplicate genes', 'human disease', 'loss of function mutation', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'theories']",OD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DP2,2011,2355000,0.012135720778121679
"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior.

"Context-Sensitive Search of Human Expression Compendia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression experiments are an abundant and robust source of functional genomics data, with thousands of microarray and a growing number of high throughput RNA sequencing studies publicly available, most interrogating clinical and biological systems relevant to disease. They hold the promise of data-driven characterization of gene function and regulation, including in specific tissues, cell lines, and disease states, and can advance the understanding and modeling of regulatory changes that form the basis of human disease. However, these data remain largely underutilized, as biology researchers do not have effective tools to explore and analyze the entire data collection to generate novel hypotheses and direct experiments. The situation is similar to that of the Internet before the search engines - a biology researcher has to know a priori which datasets pertain to the biological question she is asking, reflect the tissue/cell-lineage specific signals of interest to her, and accurately measure the expression of genes related to her pathways of interest. There is a clear need for methods that will enable biology researchers to use their domain-specific knowledge to direct their exploration of public human expression data, enabling them to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing challenging biomedical questions. Such a system should provide users with ability to effectively explore automatically identified datasets relevant to their biological question of interest, leverage metazoan complexity including cell lineage and disease specific signals, and allow the researcher to securely include their unpublished data in the analysis. To address these challenges, this proposal describes a ""Google-style"" public search engine for large collections of gene expression data built using novel search algorithms and leveraging cloud-computing technologies. This system implements a novel query-based context-sensitive algorithm for search of large expression compendia that exploits the complexity of metazoan organisms, including cell-lineage complexity and disease aspects inherent to human expression studies. Furthermore, the challenge of heterogeneity in human samples will be addressed by developing novel hierarchical learning methods to predict cell-lineage or tissue-specific gene expression based on the compendium and to identify these signals in each dataset. This will enable users to explore tissue-specific expression and also will be integrated with the search algorithm to improve search accuracy. Proposed algorithms, search engine, and user interface will be extensively evaluated in close collaboration with biology researchers, and top predictions will be tested experimentally. These methods will be implemented in a user-friendly public search system that will leverage cloud computing to provide robust interactive query response and will enable biology researchers to explore both published data collections and their own pre-publication datasets in a context-specific, integrated, and secure manner.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop a ""Google-style"" search engine for massive collections of human gene expression data. Our system will enable researchers to use their domain knowledge to explore the entirety of public human expression data to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing a diverse range of challenging biomedical questions.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health.          n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,8012280,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2011,306343,0.06135380990378458
"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,8063104,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histone H4', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2011,460136,0.009578192400634148
"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data.

"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software.

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control.

The main focus of the research effort will be to use microarray data in time course experiments with a high temporal resolution to elucidate the complex interactions among genes and develop novel analytic techniques in functional genomic. In particular, the candidate proposes to integrate the results of gene clustering/graph analysis (e.g. correlation and tagged correlation based clustering) obtained from the time course data with the information available in genetic/pathway databases relevant to the process of senescence. This will allow the evaluation of given hypotheses about functional relationships among genes and the identification of novel dependencies, which can then be directly tested via experiments in model systems of aging. By using this approach the candidate proposes to address key questions in aging research such as what transcriptional changes are under the control of a nutrient sensing system, the temporal and hierarchical relationship of these changes, the magnitude of change that is biologically relevant, and whether genes within a functional metabolic network are co-regulated at the transcriptional level.                   n/a",Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging,7895558,K25AG028753,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ecology', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Funding Applicant', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Homologous Gene', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nutrient', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detection of nutrient', 'dietary restriction', 'experience', 'fly', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'insulin signaling', 'member', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'senescence']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K25,2010,116662,0.02089298805000087
"Depression susceptibility genes and networks: expression, eQTL and GWAS analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the world (WHO). The severe, recurrent form often onsets during childhood or adolescence and becomes chronic. Heritability (35-70%) is similar to that of other common disorders for which genetic methodologies have yielded major discoveries. However, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have not yet produced significant results, and success may require much larger samples than are available. Alternative discovery strategies are urgently needed. Here, we will integrate genome-wide gene expression data from fresh blood with GWAS data to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs - SNP loci that influence gene expression) with the goal of discovering new MDD susceptibility loci using two novel analytic strategies, including a gene network analysis method that will be substantially developed in the context of this work. We will also seek to refine and confirm the results with genome-wide expression data from brain tissue. We will recruit a new, population-based sample of 500 new recurrent MDD cases and 500 depression-free controls, using a novel strategy in collaboration with a survey research company. Using RNA extracted from RNA-stabilized whole blood, genome-wide gene expression levels will be assayed with Illumina HT-12 array, and common SNP genotypes will be assayed (Illumina 660W) from DNA. (We will also assay brain tissue from two regions from 39 case and 27 control specimens for confirmatory studies.) Potential non-genetic sources of variability will be considered and statistically controlled. Two novel analytic strategies will be used to discover MDD susceptibility alleles, genes and gene regulatory networks. (1) A univariate discovery strategy will identify case-control gene expression differences; detect SNP eQTLs for the selected genes using genome-wide SNP data in controls; and test the association of these SNPs to MDD in two independent GWA datasets. The prior selection of a small number of eQTLs in a separate sample greatly improves power by reducing the burden of multiple testing in GWA analysis. (2) We will extend a novel multivariate method that uses machine learning algorithms to detect gene regulatory networks, and then apply this model to the analysis of the association of co-regulated gene modules to MDD. These algorithms (a) use a background pathway graph that integrates a wide range of high-throughput and curated bioinformatic data to predict biological relationships between genes, to bias the algorithm toward biologically plausible hypotheses; and then (b) use eQTL data to construct a set of gene regulatory modules (co-expressed genes) and infer a sparse regulatory program for each module. The method will then be applied to the GWA data, and (using a novel transfer learning method) to brain data. These studies will identify genes and gene networks underlying susceptibility to major depression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells. Using a new set of statistical methods, the study will attempt to identify genes and networks of genes that are altered in some people who suffer from depression. This information would be useful in finding new treatment or prevention strategies.              The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7810583,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,467448,0.009578192400634148
"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health.          n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,7713981,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bite', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2010,319254,0.06135380990378458
"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7896417,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'information processing', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'operation', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2010,332561,0.018960296616662254
"Transcriptional co-regulators in epidermis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The stratified mammalian epidermis develops from somatic ectoderm by the progressive addition and differentiation of superficial epidermal layers (1). After the initial morphogenesis, the epidermis is maintained by homeostatic mechanisms whereby keratinocytes move from the proliferating basal cell layer towards the surface as they undergo a series of differentiation steps, ultimately undergoing cell death. One role of keratinocyte differentiation is the formation of an effective permeability barrier, which depends on the regulated expression of a large battery of genes encoding components of the cornified and granular layers (2). Under funding by the parent grant, we are using molecular biology to investigate the role of a single transcription factor, the Grainyhead-like transcription factor Get1/Grhl3 (3-5), in epidermal differentiation. In contrast, in this revision application, we propose a systems biology approach to computationally generate transcriptional regulatory network for the process of epidermal differentiation. Thus, this application leads to a new direction and differs from the parent grant in two important ways: First, it expands the scope of the study to transcriptional regulatory networks in epidermal development in general, and second, it incorporates the methods of systems biology; thus the application is consistent with one of the key emphasis areas of this RFA (Developmental Biology - Systems biology). The specific goals are to: 1) Generate global gene expression data over the time course of epidermal keratinocyte differentiation; and 2) Use the time course gene expression data from 1, other genome-wide expression data, DNA motif information, functional annotation, and literature mining to infer transcriptional networks in epidermal differentiation. The goal of this project is also to build a new interdisciplinary team between the Andersen laboratory, whose primary expertise is in molecular/developmental biology, and Alex Ihler, a new assistant professor whose primary expertise is in graphical models, Bayesian inference methods, machine learning, and data mining. The contributions of the Ihler group -- the mathematical modeling required to define the networks -- will allow approaches and advances in our understanding of epidermal differentiation that would not be attainable without this collaboration.               Defective epidermal differentiation and disrupted barrier formation are salient features of several skin diseases, including childhood eczema and psoriasis.

"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software.

"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.)

"Depression susceptibility genes and networks: expression, eQTL and GWAS analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the world (WHO). The severe, recurrent form often onsets during childhood or adolescence and becomes chronic. Heritability (35-70%) is similar to that of other common disorders for which genetic methodologies have yielded major discoveries. However, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have not yet produced significant results, and success may require much larger samples than are available. Alternative discovery strategies are urgently needed. Here, we will integrate genome-wide gene expression data from fresh blood with GWAS data to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs - SNP loci that influence gene expression) with the goal of discovering new MDD susceptibility loci using two novel analytic strategies, including a gene network analysis method that will be substantially developed in the context of this work. We will also seek to refine and confirm the results with genome-wide expression data from brain tissue. We will recruit a new, population-based sample of 500 new recurrent MDD cases and 500 depression-free controls, using a novel strategy in collaboration with a survey research company. Using RNA extracted from RNA-stabilized whole blood, genome-wide gene expression levels will be assayed with Illumina HT-12 array, and common SNP genotypes will be assayed (Illumina 660W) from DNA. (We will also assay brain tissue from two regions from 39 case and 27 control specimens for confirmatory studies.) Potential non-genetic sources of variability will be considered and statistically controlled. Two novel analytic strategies will be used to discover MDD susceptibility alleles, genes and gene regulatory networks. (1) A univariate discovery strategy will identify case-control gene expression differences; detect SNP eQTLs for the selected genes using genome-wide SNP data in controls; and test the association of these SNPs to MDD in two independent GWA datasets. The prior selection of a small number of eQTLs in a separate sample greatly improves power by reducing the burden of multiple testing in GWA analysis. (2) We will extend a novel multivariate method that uses machine learning algorithms to detect gene regulatory networks, and then apply this model to the analysis of the association of co-regulated gene modules to MDD. These algorithms (a) use a background pathway graph that integrates a wide range of high-throughput and curated bioinformatic data to predict biological relationships between genes, to bias the algorithm toward biologically plausible hypotheses; and then (b) use eQTL data to construct a set of gene regulatory modules (co-expressed genes) and infer a sparse regulatory program for each module. The method will then be applied to the GWA data, and (using a novel transfer learning method) to brain data. These studies will identify genes and gene networks underlying susceptibility to major depression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells. Using a new set of statistical methods, the study will attempt to identify genes and networks of genes that are altered in some people who suffer from depression. This information would be useful in finding new treatment or prevention strategies.              The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health.          n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,7507028,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bite', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2009,322622,0.06135380990378458
"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7629191,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,448088,0.009578192400634148
"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome. Gene expression and genome-wide bioinformatic approaches to identify imprinted and non-imprinted metastable epialleles in both mice and humans will be employed. The results of this study should ultimately allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chronic human diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurological disorders by targeting the epigenome rather than the genome. They will also be helpful in determining under what circumstances the mouse is an appropriate toxicological model for assessing human risk from agents that elicit their biological effect primarily by altering the epigenome.             n/a",Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes,7650125,R01ES015165,"['Acids', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Blood specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chronic', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genistein', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Germ Layers', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monozygotic Twinning', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Production', 'RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Weight Gain', 'Xenobiotics', 'bisphenol A', 'bisulfite', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'environmental agent', 'fetal', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human birth weight', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'improved', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'offspring']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,578836,-0.003076833507981795
"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7646234,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'information processing', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2009,335920,0.018960296616662254
"Genetic variation and regulatory networks:  Mechanisms and complexity The focus of the proposed research is to understand the effect of sequence variation on the function of molecular networks. We will develop computational algorithms that integrate genotype, gene expression and phenotype data to construct models that describe how sequence variation perturbs the regulatory network, alters signal processing and is manifested in cellular phenotypes. Our approach is based on Bayesian networks, a framework we pioneered for the reconstruction of molecular networks from high-throughput data. We recently applied this framework to develop the Geronemo algorithm which we applied to yeast and uncovered a novel relationship between the sequence specific RNA factor PUF3 and P-Bodies, as well as a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in MKT1 that modulates this relationship. Both novel findings were experimentally validated subsequent to their discovery. Our approach is based on the complementary duality between genetic sequence and functional genomics. A significant influence of genotype on phenotype is induced by fine tuned perturbations to the complex regulatory network that governs a cell's activity. Variation in the expression of a single gene is more tractable and can be used as an intermediary to help associate genetic factors to the more complex downstream changes in phenotype in a hierarchical fashion. Conversely, DNA sequence polymorphisms are effective perturb-agens which provide a rich source of variation to help uncover regulatory relations in the molecular network as well as direct their causality. We will develop our methods using a large collection of highly variable yeast strains, for which we have generated robust quantitative growth curves under numerous environmental conditions. The methodologies piloted in yeast will be extended to genotype and gene expression data derived from tumor samples to attempt to elucidate the multiple genetic factors that drive their proliferation. These tools will be made publicly available, including a friendly graphical user interface and visualization. n/a",Genetic variation and regulatory networks:  Mechanisms and complexity,7937675,DP2OD002414,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Arginine', 'Arts', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carbon', 'Categories', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Double Effect', 'Drops', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Enzymes', 'Ethanol', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Genetics', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Figs -

"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software. Furthermore, computational strategies will be explored based on global optimization techniques, particularly convex programming and difference convex programming.           n/a",New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data,7468497,R01GM081535,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Class', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Consult', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pan Genus', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'information classification', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2008,268274,0.007696314837801529
"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.) In collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich) and Dr. George Church (Harvard) we will experimentally test at least 50 of the predicted genes without close sequence homologs in E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae.           n/a",Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities,7496031,R01GM079759,"['Animal Model', 'Arts', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Church', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Orphan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Sequence Homology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'metabolomics', 'protein function', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,383732,0.01720398765692415
"Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microarray technology enables investigators to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes and holds the promise to cast new light onto the regulatory mechanisms of the genome. A main avenue of experimental investigation, leveraging on this technology, is based on the temporal dissection of cellular mechanisms. Temporal experiments offer the possibility of observing these mechanisms in action and to break down the genome into sets of genes involved in the same processes. The overall goal of this project is to develop an unsupervised approach and an integrated software environment to automatically discover regulatory mechanisms from temporal microarray experiments. The hypothesis underpinning our approach is that complex interaction patterns can be identified through analysis of conditional rather than marginal gene expression profiles. This novel approach also provides principled guidance to experimental design and sampling strategies, and it naturally extends to a large class of statistical models, able to capture a wider range of dynamic behaviors and experimental designs. We plan to develop a comprehensive framework to design and analyze microarray data collected through temporal experiments. This framework will be used to specify and answer the critical design questions of sample size and sampling frequency determination. Using this framework, we will develop a new model-based approach and an iterative search algorithm, called Conditional Clustering, to identify different patterns of behavior determined by a set of genes through the analysis of the behavior of a gene given a set of other genes, rather than the behavior of each gene in isolation. We will implement this design and analysis framework in a computer program that will be distributed over the Internet.This project brings together researchers in artificial intelligence, theoretical statistics and experimental design with a long track record of methodological contributions to bioinformatics to develop a novel methodological approach to a critical question at the forefront of genomic research.         n/a",Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics,7350919,R01HG003354,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Class', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Names', 'Numbers', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Today', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'computer program', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'size', 'software development', 'statistics']",NHGRI,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2008,298801,0.045119424720771024
"Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Funding is sought for a five year mentored training period at Brown University for Dr. Nicola Neretti to transition from physics to independent investigator in computational biology. The candidate has a Physics PhD from Brown University, and has been working in the field of signal processing and machine learning. During the past year he has been part of a collaborative project with Dr. John Sedivy (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry) which resulted in a published paper about the analysis of gene expression array data to target c-Myc-activated genes with a correlation-based method. He has established other productive collaborations with members of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology (CCMB) at Brown University. The principal mentor will be Dr. Marc Tatar (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). The secondary mentors will be Dr. Charles Lawrence (Dep. Applied Mathematics) and Dr. John  Sedivy. The work plan for the five years is to split the training/research effort evenly between computation and biology. For the training requirements the candidate plans to attend courses and workshops in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related fields. Dr. Neretti also plans to complete lab rotations in the laboratory of Dr. Marc Tatar and Dr. John Sedivy, to acquire first hand experience in generating the biological data he will later analyze. The main focus of the research effort will be to use microarray data in time course experiments with a high temporal resolution to elucidate the complex interactions among genes and develop novel analytic techniques in functional genomic. In particular, the candidate proposes to integrate the results of gene clustering/graph analysis (e.g. correlation and tagged correlation based clustering) obtained from the time course data with the information available in genetic/pathway databases relevant to the process of senescence. This will allow the evaluation of given hypotheses about functional relationships among genes and the identification of novel dependencies, which can then be directly tested via experiments in model systems of aging. By using this approach the candidate proposes to address key questions in aging research such as what transcriptional changes are under the control of a nutrient sensing system, the temporal and hierarchical relationship of these changes, the magnitude of change that is biologically relevant, and whether genes within a functional metabolic network are co-regulated at the transcriptional level.                   n/a",Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging,7473948,K25AG028753,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ecology', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Funding Applicant', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Homologous Gene', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nutrient', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detection of nutrient', 'dietary restriction', 'experience', 'fly', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'insulin signaling', 'member', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'senescence']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K25,2008,122190,0.02089298805000087
"Statistical and Computational Methods for Systematically Mining the SNP and Gene     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This application is submitted in response to PAR-04-159 ``Small Grants Program for Cancer Epidemiology'' `Analyzing existing data that otherwise may have gone unexplored, such as pooled analysis of data from multiple studies coordinated into consortia.' A quick review of research articles in current literature, there are only tens of paper related to cancer study with integrated SNP and gene expression data. The lack of algorithms and user-friendly software to mine the existing data may be partly blamed. The proposed study will provide useful tools to mine the genetic data from different sources. This pilot project focuses on developing efficient algorithms for clustering, molecular network construction, and biomarker discovery with integrated SNP and gene expression data. With the efficient data mining methods we develop, cancer researchers may get much more useful information from the otherwise unexplored data. Therefore it has broad implications in the analysis of all high priority areas in cancer epidemiology research identified by Progress Review Groups, such as multiple myeloma and cancers of the breast, colon/rectum, prostate, lung, pancreas, and brain, and linking genetic polymorphisms with other variable related to cancer risk.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7445536,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,467804,0.009578192400634148
"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials. We propose to study novel methods for analyzing the large-scale biomedical data to realize their full potential of molecular diagnosis and prognosis of transplant rejection prediction for critical early treatment.          n/a",Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data,7386333,R01GM083345,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Experimental Designs', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Graft Rejection', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Oncogene Activation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer microarray', 'cancer type', 'design', 'desire', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney allograft', 'method development', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'theories', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2008,255036,0.02480769623787025
"Genetics Pathways of Glioma Invasion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malignant tumors of glial lineage are therapeutic challenges by virtue of relative inherent resistance to conventional cytolytic therapies and the innate proclivity of these cancer cells to invade into surrounding normal brain. Advances in extending median survival of glioma patients await strategies by which to control invasive tumor. The central hypothesis of this project is that local invasion by malignant glioblastoma cells is driven by specific and unique gene expression changes. Interference with the expression of these genes or interruption of the function of the gene products is likely to specifically target invasive glioblastoma cells, consequently impacting a major cause of tumor progression and recurrence. Success already realized from our use of laser capture microdissection and cDNA microarray analyses has generated candidate genes that have been validated in clinical specimens, and have undergone detailed cell and molecular biology experiments to determine the mechanism(s) by which candidate glioblastoma invasion genes activate the migratory or invasive process. Advances will be garnered through pursuit of 3 aims: The first aim is to sustain the discovery of candidate genes expressed or silenced in highly invasive glioblastoma cells compared to noninvading cells in the same tumor, and to place these candidate gene products into a functional matrix of aberrant signaling outcomes underlying invasion. The second aim is to validate candidate genes discovered in Aim #1 in the context of human glioblastoma invasion. The third aim is to determine the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of action of these genes and their matrix of aberrant signaling to discover points of convergence that serve as targets of vulnerability for therapeutic intervention. The sustained success of this project will assemble an understanding of genes driving the invasive phenotype of glioblastoma cells, discovering and validating crucial biochemical or regulatory linkages with other associated cell behaviors of proliferation and cell survival pathways. These findings will empirically elucidate those points of convergence in the pathways of the invasive phenotype that, when targeted by therapy, will most impact the malignant glial cell.         n/a",Genetics Pathways of Glioma Invasion,7391683,R01NS042262,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Co-Immunoprecipitations', 'Collection', 'Companions', 'Computational Technique', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Sequence', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Harvest', 'Histology', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interruption', 'Invaded', 'Invasive', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Glioma', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Neuroglia', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Validation', 'cDNA Arrays', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'cryostat', 'gene function', 'laser capture microdissection', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'programs', 'research study', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,TRANSLATIONAL GENOMICS RESEARCH INST,R01,2008,405644,0.0048790154703172856
"A Gene Expression Based Blood Test for Rheumatic Disease Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Clinical dilemma: Recent advances in biologic therapies for rheumatic diseases provide a means for more profound disease management. Proper diagnosis is a necessary aspect of choosing the proper biologic therapy. While disease diagnosis, based on clinical findings and laboratory tests, is effective in a significant number of patients, it can be problematic in patients with early disease, mild symptoms, or unclear presentation, leading to delayed or inappropriate treatment with poor patient outcomes and/or exposures to unnecessary drug toxicities. This problem is due in part to limitations of specificity and sensitivity of current rheumatology diagnostic laboratory tests. Many of these tests are designed to include or rule out one disease, which may be inadequate to obtain a diagnosis if the results are negative. Our preliminary data suggest that a single blood test can be developed which is capable of sensitive and specific disease diagnosis of many common rheumatic diseases using gene expression profiling of peripheral blood. We also have data suggesting that this multi-disease test is effective in patients with early disease prior to full clinical differentiation and may aid in guiding earlier treatment which can dramatically improve outcomes.   Approach: To assess the potential of gene expression-based diagnostic testing, clinical samples were collected from a cohort of patients with definitive forms of inflammatory disease, and broad-based gene expression profiling was performed. Multivariate algorithms identified 38 genes that distinguished controls and the four inflammatory diseases tested with high specificity and sensitivity. We have subsequently collected RNA from a second larger patient cohort with sufficient size to power a study to distinguish among a set of rheumatic diseases that can be difficult to distinguish, namely rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ankylosing spondylitis. Biostatistical analyses of gene expression profiles will allow us to translate these findings into two high throughput clinical tests, the first based on gene expression results and the second based on serum protein biomarkers. Finally, we will assess the prognostic power of gene expression profiling by examining results from patients early in their disease cycle with undifferentiated arthritis to determine who is likely to develop erosive disease and who is likely to go into remission. These findings will allow physicians to use more proactive forms of therapy in early undifferentiated arthritis to delay onset of erosive disease and to use less expensive drugs with fewer side effects for patients that are likely to remit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will identify novel blood markers (biomarkers) for some of the more common forms of rheumatic diseases.  These biomarkers will be used by physicians to accurately diagnose these diseases and to help distinguish patients who are more likely to develop severe forms of disease from those likely to go into remission.  Earlier diagnosis and treatment are linked to better outcome in patients.       n/a",A Gene Expression Based Blood Test for Rheumatic Disease Diagnosis,7394136,R43AR055855,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Ankylosing spondylitis', 'Arthritis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease regression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Immunology procedure', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Serum Proteins', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Undifferentiated', 'base', 'cohort', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prognostic', 'response', 'size', 'tool']",NIAMS,"CRESCENDO BIOSCIENCE, INC.",R43,2008,147000,0.05015303330311857
"Gene Expression in Drug-inflammation Models as Predictive of Idiosyncratic ADRS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Idiosyncratic, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have serious health and economic consequences, yet they are not identified in preclinical testing due to a lack of predictive models. We have developed an animal model that reproduces idiosyncratic liver injury. The model involves treatment of rats with a nontoxic dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce mild inflammation followed by treatment with a nontoxic dose of drug. Using this model with two drugs in different pharmacological classes, hepatic gene expression near the onset of injury distinguishes drugs associated with idiosyncratic liver injury in humans from drugs with similar structures that do not have this liability. The long term goal of this research is to evaluate the usefulness of changes in hepatic gene expression in animal models of drug-inflammation interaction as a preclinical predictor of the propensity of drugs to cause idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in humans. To test the hypothesis that global, hepatic gene expression changes in animal models of inflammation-drug interactions can be used to predict the propensity of drugs to cause human, idiosyncratic liver injury, rats will be cotreated with LPS and one of several drugs (at doses that alone are not hepatotoxic), and microarray analysis of gene expression will be performed on livers. In Specific Aim 1, hepatic gene expression will be analyzed for treatment-related changes. Drugs known to produce idiosyncratic liver injury in people and drugs that are in the same pharmacological classes but are not associated with idiosyncrasy will serve as a ""training set"" in this Aim. In Aim 2, the microarray data will be analyzed for patterns of expression unique to the drug-inflammation interactions that are associated with idiosyncrasy-producing drugs, and the expression data will be probed for specific genes or sets of genes that determine these unique patterns. In Aim 3, additional drugs will be used as a ""validation set"" to evaluate the usefulness of the patterns and genes identified in Aims 1 and 2. The immediate product of these studies will be an animal model of drug-inflammation interaction for which a set of genes has been identified that predicts the propensity for a drug to cause idiosyncratic liver injury in people. If successful, these studies will provide models with which to identify preclinically those drugs that could cause this type of liver damage in people. The relevance of this research to public health lies in the potential to prevent the occurrence of ""unpredictable"", drug-induced liver damage. n/a",Gene Expression in Drug-inflammation Models as Predictive of Idiosyncratic ADRS,7487344,R21GM075865,"['Address', 'Adverse reactions', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorpromazine', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug toxicity', 'Drug usage', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Famotidine', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Microarray Analysis', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histamine-2 Receptor Antagonist', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Ranitidine', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'animal data', 'base', 'data mining', 'drug development', 'drug market', 'health economics', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'post-market', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'segregation', 'trovafloxacin']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,351137,0.01500321080910926
"Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the genomes of more and more species are sequenced it has become apparent that 1 of the most powerful techniques for detemining region function in the human genome is by comparison to the genomes of other species. The implications of such understanding for disease diagnosis and specialized drug and vaccine design are dear. Similarly, genomic comparison between bacteria can reveal regions which are functionally important in the development of infectious diseases and again aid drug and vaccine design. This project has 2 primary research goals. One (1) is the development of methodology for finding functionally predictive signatures of non-coding sequences (NCS) highly conserved across multiple species, and the other is to develop novel approaches for defecting Horizontal Gene Transfer (HG'T). The comparison of genomes is the common thread in this research. ln pursuit of their first goal, the investigators plan to integrate genomic sequence data, provided by their collaborators, with experimental and literature data, such as microarray-expression data, GO-functional-annotation for nearby genes, and ChlP-Chip data. The results will be used to evaluate the functional relevance, if any, of each NCS and then to define a signature predictive of function in terms of measurable covariates and sequence structure. For instance, if a sequence signature characterizes NCS whose nearest genes contribute to a particular function then an unknown gene close to an NCS with the same signature would be a prime candidate for interrogation of that function. The Investigators propose to attack this problem  by 1). Developing non standard types of clustering methods based on supervised learning algorithms, e.g., Random Forests, 2) Representing the NCS by the parameters of a stochastic model and determining appropriate thresholds for model fitting by using resampling and other Monte Carlo methods. Under the second topic, the investigators propose 2 different approaches for determining whether functionaIly significant FGT has occurred in bacteria. The first approach is to take a known functionally important famlly (NIFgenes) for which HGT is a matter of dispute, and devise quantitative measures which they expect will enable a firm conclusion. They intend to refine similarity measures between genes in different species ,such as BLAST scores, corrected for evolutionary distance. They will compute these measures for pairs of NIF genes in different species, pairs, pairs of genes known to be HGT (antibiotic immunity conferring genes) and genes very unlikely to be HGT (ribosomal proteins). The second approach is to look for anomalously long stretches of 16s RNA conserved within substantial subsets of bacterial species which are otherwise only distantly related.  Mathematical and statistical challenge include: Under approach I, standardizing comparisons of genes with different mutation rates; devising an appropriate classifier for HGT vs. non HGT, and computing appropriate estimates of the probability of classifying a gene as HGT when it isn't and vice versa; Under approach II, extending existing methods for detecting large inclusions by taking into account phylogenetic tree topology and branch lengths.            n/a",Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT,7418308,R01GM075312,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Boxing', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Disputes', 'Distant', 'Drops', 'Exhibits', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nif Genes', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Planning Techniques', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Score', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Tetraodontidae', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'heuristics', 'markov model', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'size', 'statistics', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'willingness']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,162196,0.01339484425147399
"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome. Gene expression and genome-wide bioinformatic approaches to identify imprinted and non-imprinted metastable epialleles in both mice and humans will be employed. The results of this study should ultimately allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chronic human diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurological disorders by targeting the epigenome rather than the genome. They will also be helpful in determining under what circumstances the mouse is an appropriate toxicological model for assessing human risk from agents that elicit their biological effect primarily by altering the epigenome.             n/a",Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes,7478414,R01ES015165,"['Acids', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Blood specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genistein', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Germ Layers', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monozygotic Twinning', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Production', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Supplementation', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Xenobiotics', 'bisphenol A', 'bisulfite', 'carcinogenesis', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'environmental agent', 'fetal', 'human birth weight', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'improved', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'toxicant', 'uptake']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,577197,-0.003076833507981795
"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7473118,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Condition', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'day', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2008,335920,0.018960296616662254
"Application of MAGNet Tools to Gene Regulatory Networks in Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Application of MAGNet Tools to Gene Regulatory Networks in Cancer Principal Investigator: Sander, Chris Project Summary / Abstract We propose to apply computational algorithms from the Columbia University National Center for Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet) to study gene regulatory networks in human cancer. The project will be led by the Computational Biology Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and will build an intensive collaboration between computer scientists and clinical researchers. The aims of this project are to:  Make discoveries about gene regulation in soft tissue sarcoma and prostate cancer.  Strengthen the National Center's computational tools for the analysis of gene regulation and biological pathways, and  Develop better methods for predicting disease outcome in cancer patients. Specifically, advanced computational algorithms and software developed as part of this project will be used to predict gene regulators and their targets from mRNA and microRNA expression profiles. We propose to study three types of gene regulation in cancer samples: i) transcription of protein coding genes ii) transcription of microRNA genes and iii) translational regulation of protein coding genes by mature microRNAs. The predicted regulatory events will be compared with biological knowledge in pathway databases in order to discover novel regulatory events, detect biological processes characteristic of specific cancer subtypes and assess the accuracy of the prediction algorithms.

"Statistical Methods for Genomic and Proteomic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose developing, evaluating and comparing statistical methods in analyzing and interpreting microarray data, including a heart failure dataset collected in the co-Principal Investigator's lab. Some of the proposed methods will incorporate or be applied to other types of genomic or proteomic data. In Aim A.1, we consider detecting differential gene expression. A weighted permutation scheme is proposed to improve permutation-based inference procedures, and these methods will be compared with several recently proposed parametric and semi-parametric methods. We also propose incorporating existing biological data in the statistical methods. In Aim A.2, we study a clustering-based classification (CBC) method for gene function prediction using microarray data. CBC will be compared with other state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and random forests. Other sources of biological data, such as protein-protein interaction data, will be incorporated in the proposed method. In Aim A.3, we consider sample classification and prediction based on gene expression profiles in a general framework called penalized partial least squares (PPLS). PPLS will be compared with other supervised machine learning algorithms. We will extend PPLS to combine microarray data from multiple studies.

"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software. Furthermore, computational strategies will be explored based on global optimization techniques, particularly convex programming and difference convex programming.           n/a",New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data,7299383,R01GM081535,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Class', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Consult', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pan Genus', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'information classification', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2007,266852,0.007696314837801529
"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.) In collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich) and Dr. George Church (Harvard) we will experimentally test at least 50 of the predicted genes without close sequence homologs in E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae.           n/a",Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities,7322388,R01GM079759,"['Animal Model', 'Arts', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Church', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Orphan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Sequence Homology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'metabolomics', 'protein function', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,364130,0.01720398765692415
"Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microarray technology enables investigators to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes and holds the promise to cast new light onto the regulatory mechanisms of the genome. A main avenue of experimental investigation, leveraging on this technology, is based on the temporal dissection of cellular mechanisms. Temporal experiments offer the possibility of observing these mechanisms in action and to break down the genome into sets of genes involved in the same processes. The overall goal of this project is to develop an unsupervised approach and an integrated software environment to automatically discover regulatory mechanisms from temporal microarray experiments. The hypothesis underpinning our approach is that complex interaction patterns can be identified through analysis of conditional rather than marginal gene expression profiles. This novel approach also provides principled guidance to experimental design and sampling strategies, and it naturally extends to a large class of statistical models, able to capture a wider range of dynamic behaviors and experimental designs. We plan to develop a comprehensive framework to design and analyze microarray data collected through temporal experiments. This framework will be used to specify and answer the critical design questions of sample size and sampling frequency determination. Using this framework, we will develop a new model-based approach and an iterative search algorithm, called Conditional Clustering, to identify different patterns of behavior determined by a set of genes through the analysis of the behavior of a gene given a set of other genes, rather than the behavior of each gene in isolation. We will implement this design and analysis framework in a computer program that will be distributed over the Internet.This project brings together researchers in artificial intelligence, theoretical statistics and experimental design with a long track record of methodological contributions to bioinformatics to develop a novel methodological approach to a critical question at the forefront of genomic research.         n/a",Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics,7176152,R01HG003354,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Class', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Names', 'Numbers', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Today', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'computer program', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'size', 'software development', 'statistics']",NHGRI,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL CORPORATION,R01,2007,305165,0.045119424720771024
"Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Funding is sought for a five year mentored training period at Brown University for Dr. Nicola Neretti to transition from physics to independent investigator in computational biology. The candidate has a Physics PhD from Brown University, and has been working in the field of signal processing and machine learning. During the past year he has been part of a collaborative project with Dr. John Sedivy (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry) which resulted in a published paper about the analysis of gene expression array data to target c-Myc-activated genes with a correlation-based method. He has established other productive collaborations with members of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology (CCMB) at Brown University. The principal mentor will be Dr. Marc Tatar (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). The secondary mentors will be Dr. Charles Lawrence (Dep. Applied Mathematics) and Dr. John  Sedivy. The work plan for the five years is to split the training/research effort evenly between computation and biology. For the training requirements the candidate plans to attend courses and workshops in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related fields. Dr. Neretti also plans to complete lab rotations in the laboratory of Dr. Marc Tatar and Dr. John Sedivy, to acquire first hand experience in generating the biological data he will later analyze. The main focus of the research effort will be to use microarray data in time course experiments with a high temporal resolution to elucidate the complex interactions among genes and develop novel analytic techniques in functional genomic. In particular, the candidate proposes to integrate the results of gene clustering/graph analysis (e.g. correlation and tagged correlation based clustering) obtained from the time course data with the information available in genetic/pathway databases relevant to the process of senescence. This will allow the evaluation of given hypotheses about functional relationships among genes and the identification of novel dependencies, which can then be directly tested via experiments in model systems of aging. By using this approach the candidate proposes to address key questions in aging research such as what transcriptional changes are under the control of a nutrient sensing system, the temporal and hierarchical relationship of these changes, the magnitude of change that is biologically relevant, and whether genes within a functional metabolic network are co-regulated at the transcriptional level.                   n/a",Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging,7259194,K25AG028753,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ecology', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Funding Applicant', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Homologous Gene', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nutrient', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detection of nutrient', 'dietary restriction', 'experience', 'fly', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'insulin signaling', 'member', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'senescence']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K25,2007,102389,0.02089298805000087
"Statistical and Computational Methods for Systematically Mining the SNP and Gene     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This application is submitted in response to PAR-04-159 ``Small Grants Program for Cancer Epidemiology'' `Analyzing existing data that otherwise may have gone unexplored, such as pooled analysis of data from multiple studies coordinated into consortia.' A quick review of research articles in current literature, there are only tens of paper related to cancer study with integrated SNP and gene expression data. The lack of algorithms and user-friendly software to mine the existing data may be partly blamed. The proposed study will provide useful tools to mine the genetic data from different sources. This pilot project focuses on developing efficient algorithms for clustering, molecular network construction, and biomarker discovery with integrated SNP and gene expression data. With the efficient data mining methods we develop, cancer researchers may get much more useful information from the otherwise unexplored data. Therefore it has broad implications in the analysis of all high priority areas in cancer epidemiology research identified by Progress Review Groups, such as multiple myeloma and cancers of the breast, colon/rectum, prostate, lung, pancreas, and brain, and linking genetic polymorphisms with other variable related to cancer risk.

"Gene Expression in Drug-inflammation Models as Predictive of Idiosyncratic ADRS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Idiosyncratic, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have serious health and economic consequences, yet they are not identified in preclinical testing due to a lack of predictive models. We have developed an animal model that reproduces idiosyncratic liver injury. The model involves treatment of rats with a nontoxic dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce mild inflammation followed by treatment with a nontoxic dose of drug. Using this model with two drugs in different pharmacological classes, hepatic gene expression near the onset of injury distinguishes drugs associated with idiosyncratic liver injury in humans from drugs with similar structures that do not have this liability. The long term goal of this research is to evaluate the usefulness of changes in hepatic gene expression in animal models of drug-inflammation interaction as a preclinical predictor of the propensity of drugs to cause idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in humans. To test the hypothesis that global, hepatic gene expression changes in animal models of inflammation-drug interactions can be used to predict the propensity of drugs to cause human, idiosyncratic liver injury, rats will be cotreated with LPS and one of several drugs (at doses that alone are not hepatotoxic), and microarray analysis of gene expression will be performed on livers. In Specific Aim 1, hepatic gene expression will be analyzed for treatment-related changes. Drugs known to produce idiosyncratic liver injury in people and drugs that are in the same pharmacological classes but are not associated with idiosyncrasy will serve as a ""training set"" in this Aim. In Aim 2, the microarray data will be analyzed for patterns of expression unique to the drug-inflammation interactions that are associated with idiosyncrasy-producing drugs, and the expression data will be probed for specific genes or sets of genes that determine these unique patterns. In Aim 3, additional drugs will be used as a ""validation set"" to evaluate the usefulness of the patterns and genes identified in Aims 1 and 2. The immediate product of these studies will be an animal model of drug-inflammation interaction for which a set of genes has been identified that predicts the propensity for a drug to cause idiosyncratic liver injury in people. If successful, these studies will provide models with which to identify preclinically those drugs that could cause this type of liver damage in people. The relevance of this research to public health lies in the potential to prevent the occurrence of ""unpredictable"", drug-induced liver damage. n/a",Gene Expression in Drug-inflammation Models as Predictive of Idiosyncratic ADRS,7263212,R21GM075865,"['Address', 'Adverse reactions', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorpromazine', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug toxicity', 'Drug usage', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Famotidine', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Microarray Analysis', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histamine-2 Receptor Antagonist', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Ranitidine', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'animal data', 'base', 'data mining', 'drug development', 'drug market', 'health economics', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'post-market', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'segregation', 'trovafloxacin']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,357938,0.01500321080910926
"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome. Gene expression and genome-wide bioinformatic approaches to identify imprinted and non-imprinted metastable epialleles in both mice and humans will be employed. The results of this study should ultimately allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chronic human diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurological disorders by targeting the epigenome rather than the genome. They will also be helpful in determining under what circumstances the mouse is an appropriate toxicological model for assessing human risk from agents that elicit their biological effect primarily by altering the epigenome.             n/a",Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes,7290450,R01ES015165,"['Acids', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Blood specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genistein', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Germ Layers', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monozygotic Twinning', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Production', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Supplementation', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Xenobiotics', 'bisphenol A', 'bisulfite', 'carcinogenesis', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'environmental agent', 'fetal', 'human birth weight', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'improved', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'toxicant', 'uptake']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,568393,-0.003076833507981795
"Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the genomes of more and more species are sequenced it has become apparent that 1 of the most powerful techniques for detemining region function in the human genome is by comparison to the genomes of other species. The implications of such understanding for disease diagnosis and specialized drug and vaccine design are dear. Similarly, genomic comparison between bacteria can reveal regions which are functionally important in the development of infectious diseases and again aid drug and vaccine design. This project has 2 primary research goals. One (1) is the development of methodology for finding functionally predictive signatures of non-coding sequences (NCS) highly conserved across multiple species, and the other is to develop novel approaches for defecting Horizontal Gene Transfer (HG'T). The comparison of genomes is the common thread in this research. ln pursuit of their first goal, the investigators plan to integrate genomic sequence data, provided by their collaborators, with experimental and literature data, such as microarray-expression data, GO-functional-annotation for nearby genes, and ChlP-Chip data. The results will be used to evaluate the functional relevance, if any, of each NCS and then to define a signature predictive of function in terms of measurable covariates and sequence structure. For instance, if a sequence signature characterizes NCS whose nearest genes contribute to a particular function then an unknown gene close to an NCS with the same signature would be a prime candidate for interrogation of that function. The Investigators propose to attack this problem  by 1). Developing non standard types of clustering methods based on supervised learning algorithms, e.g., Random Forests, 2) Representing the NCS by the parameters of a stochastic model and determining appropriate thresholds for model fitting by using resampling and other Monte Carlo methods.

"Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT As the genomes of more and more species are sequenced it has become apparent that one of the mosl powerful techniques for determining region function in the human genome is by comparison to the genomes of other species. The implications of such understanding for disease diagnosis and specialized drug and vaccine design are clear. Similarly, genpmic comparison between bacteria can reveal regions which are functionally important in the development of infectious diseases and again aid drug and vaccine design. This project has two primary research goals. One is the development of methodology for finding functionally predictive signatures of non-coding sequences (NCS)highly conserved across multiple species, and the other is to develop novel approaches for detecting Horizontal Gene Transfer (HOT). The comparison of genomes is the common thread in this research.In pursuit of their first goal, the investigators plan to integrate genomic sequence data, provided by their collaborators, with experimental and literature data, such as microarray-expression data, GO-functional- annotation for nearby genes, and ChlP-Chip data. The results will be used to evaluate the functional relevance, if any, of each NCS and then to define a signature predictive of function in terms of measurable covariates and sequence structure. For instance, if a sequence signature characterizes NCS whose nearest genes contribute to a particular function then an unknown gene close to an NCS with the same signature would be a prime candidate for interrogation of that function. The investigators propose to attack this problem by 1). Developing non standard types of clustering methods based on supervised learning algorithms, e.g.,Random Forests, 2) Representing the NCS by the parameters of a stochastic model and determining appropriate thresholds for model fitting by using resampling and other Monte Carlo methods.  Under the second topic, the investigators propose two different approaches for determining whether Functionally significant HGT has occurred in bacteria. The first approach is to take a known functionally important family(NIFgenes) for which HGT is a matter of dispute, and devise quantitative measures which they expect will enable a firm conclusion.

"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7317856,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Condition', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'day', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2007,335920,0.018960296616662254
"Genetical Genomics Analysis Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Response to drug treatment is thought dependent upon genotype for many modern therapies. Knowledge of how each genotype responds to a particular therapy is bene?cial only in that one can identify portions of the population which cannot reap the benefits of said treatment. A better course of action is to identify not only which genotype responds, or not, to a particular therapy, but to identify which region of the genome is responding, or not, and how. We believe that this information will lead to new drug targets and better therapies that benefit a larger portion of the population. The goal of this proposal is to provide a suite of software tools for genetic and genomic scientists performing gene mapping experiments with genomic data as the response variable. These tools will ideally provide functionality for 1) detecting polymorphic regions of the genome that con- fer transcript expression differences, 2) identify polymorphic regions of the genome that impart expression differences in genes located elsewhere in the genome, and 3) detecting interactions between loci that may correspond to epistatic effects on transcription. Some software already exists to perform each of these tasks as distinct independent solutions. This proposal intends to produce an integrated solution, S+EQTL (S-PLUS for expression quantitative trait loci mapping), that utilizes the power of S-PLUS and both incorporates and extends the functionality of an exist- ing genetics suite. By providing scientists with an integrated set of tools for genomics experiments with a genetic component, more productive time can be spent interpreting the results rather than transforming data into different formats to be processed by multiple software analysis packages. This software should also address one of the most dif?cult aspects of genetical genomics exper- iments, the so called curse of dimensionality. As the genomics community continues gathering knowledge of transcripts in various organisms, the arrays that interrogate transcript abundance only grow larger in the number of transcript species included. In the absence of tools designed for this purpose, the research scientist is left with the option of either focusing on a narrow set of previously known genes or performing a grid-wise search on all genes in the array. The former is not interesting as these genes are likely well studied and may provide little novel insight. The latter is computationally demanding and may not be possible on the new, larger arrays. A recent publication presents a novel solution that may be enhanced to gain both power and scale using Bayesian methodology. Knowledge of how each genotype responds to a particular drug therapy is beneficial only in that one can identify portions of the population which cannot reap the benefits of said treatment. A better course of action is to identify not only which genotype responds, or not, to a particular therapy, but to identify which region of the genome is responding, or not, and how. We believe that the development of analytic tools for gene mapping experiments to identify this information will lead to new drug targets and better therapies that benefit a larger portion of the population.          n/a",Genetical Genomics Analysis Software,7216142,R43GM079852,"['Address', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Genetics', 'Anus', 'Arizona', 'Bioconductor', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cations', 'Cattle', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Con-fer', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Department of Defense', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Exons', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Government Agencies', 'Graph', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investments', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Nebraska', 'North Carolina', 'Numbers', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmaceutical Services', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Purpose', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Sus scrofa', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thermogenesis', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'animal breeding', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'expression vector', 'genetic pedigree', 'hazard', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'lecturer', 'novel', 'professor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R43,2007,101707,0.010547352016424875
"Genetic variation and regulatory networks:  Mechanisms and complexity The focus of the proposed research is to understand the effect of sequence variation on the function of molecular networks. We will develop computational algorithms that integrate genotype, gene expression and phenotype data to construct models that describe how sequence variation perturbs the regulatory network, alters signal processing and is manifested in cellular phenotypes. Our approach is based on Bayesian networks, a framework we pioneered for the reconstruction of molecular networks from high-throughput data. We recently applied this framework to develop the Geronemo algorithm which we applied to yeast and uncovered a novel relationship between the sequence specific RNA factor PUF3 and P-Bodies, as well as a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in MKT1 that modulates this relationship. Both novel findings were experimentally validated subsequent to their discovery. Our approach is based on the complementary duality between genetic sequence and functional genomics. A significant influence of genotype on phenotype is induced by fine tuned perturbations to the complex regulatory network that governs a cell's activity. Variation in the expression of a single gene is more tractable and can be used as an intermediary to help associate genetic factors to the more complex downstream changes in phenotype in a hierarchical fashion. Conversely, DNA sequence polymorphisms are effective perturb-agens which provide a rich source of variation to help uncover regulatory relations in the molecular network as well as direct their causality. We will develop our methods using a large collection of highly variable yeast strains, for which we have generated robust quantitative growth curves under numerous environmental conditions. The methodologies piloted in yeast will be extended to genotype and gene expression data derived from tumor samples to attempt to elucidate the multiple genetic factors that drive their proliferation. These tools will be made publicly available, including a friendly graphical user interface and visualization. n/a",Genetic variation and regulatory networks:  Mechanisms and complexity,7431104,DP2OD002414,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Arginine', 'Arts', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carbon', 'Categories', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Compatible', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Double Effect', 'Drops', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Enzymes', 'Ethanol', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Genetics', 'Face', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Figs -

"Clinical & Microarray Data Predict Lung Cancer Outcomes Patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) have a poor prognosis.

"Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The reverse engineering of cellular genetic circuits from gene expression data is an important and scientifically challenging problem. When applied to system more complex than a yeast cell, however, most of the approaches for reverse engineering are limited by their reliance on a significant number of ad-hoc perturbation, such as gene knockout.  We propose to address these issues and to attempt to reconstruct the genetic circuitry of human B-cells by coupling three distinct components: 1) an information theoretic method for the inference of cellular networks from microarray profile data for a large number of distinct cellular and molecular phenotypes 2) A synthetic network simulation framework for the assessment of the performance of the reverse engineering under a variety of constraints and conditions, such as noise and network complexity. 3) An adaptive learning method that will iteratively apply optimal perturbations to the biological system, which will allow refining the cellular network model over time.  Furthermore, we propose to biologically validate this approach by elucidating the cellular networks of human B lymphocytes, from a variety of normal, tumor-derived, and experimentally manipulated B cell phenotypes, which are significant both from an oncological and immunological perspective. This will be accomplished by analyzing an existing set of over 340 high-quality microarray expression profiles.  Finally, we will create a software platform to reverse engineer any biological system for which adequate microarray data is available. The platform will also allow to design and perform virtual, in-silico gene perturbation experiments. n/a",Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes,7082976,R01CA109755,"['B lymphocyte', 'artificial intelligence', 'cellular oncology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'cytogenetics', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression profiling', 'genetic models', 'human data', 'lymphoma', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular genetics', 'molecular oncology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,373483,0.024334802601253296
"Statistical Methods for Genomic and Proteomic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose developing, evaluating and comparing statistical methods in analyzing and interpreting microarray data, including a heart failure dataset collected in the co-Principal Investigator's lab. Some of the proposed methods will incorporate or be applied to other types of genomic or proteomic data. In Aim A.1, we consider detecting differential gene expression. A weighted permutation scheme is proposed to improve permutation-based inference procedures, and these methods will be compared with several recently proposed parametric and semi-parametric methods.

"Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dyanamics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microarray technology enables investigators to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes and holds the promise to cast new light onto the regulatory mechanisms of the genome. A main avenue of experimental investigation, leveraging on this technology, is based on the temporal dissection of cellular mechanisms. Temporal experiments offer the possibility of observing these mechanisms in action and to break down the genome into sets of genes involved in the same processes. The overall goal of this project is to develop an unsupervised approach and an integrated software environment to automatically discover regulatory mechanisms from temporal microarray experiments. The hypothesis underpinning our approach is that complex interaction patterns can be identified through analysis of conditional rather than marginal gene expression profiles. This novel approach also provides principled guidance to experimental design and sampling strategies, and it naturally extends to a large class of statistical models, able to capture a wider range of dynamic behaviors and experimental designs. We plan to develop a comprehensive framework to design and analyze microarray data collected through temporal experiments. This framework will be used to specify and answer the critical design questions of sample size and sampling frequency determination. Using this framework, we will develop a new model-based approach and an iterative search algorithm, called Conditional Clustering, to identify different patterns of behavior determined by a set of genes through the analysis of the behavior of a gene given a set of other genes, rather than the behavior of each gene in isolation. We will implement this design and analysis framework in a computer program that will be distributed over the Internet.This project brings together researchers in artificial intelligence, theoretical statistics and experimental design with a long track record of methodological contributions to bioinformatics to develop a novel methodological approach to a critical question at the forefront of genomic research.         n/a",Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dyanamics,7033620,R01HG003354,"['behavior', 'computer program /software', 'experimental designs', 'gene expression', 'genes', 'genome', 'mathematical model', 'model']",NHGRI,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOSTON,R01,2006,325000,0.04565678715542919
"Detecting relations among heterogeneous genomic datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past decade, the new focus on genomics has highlighted a particular challenge: to integrate the different views of the genome that are provided by various types of experimental data. The long-term objective of this work is to provide a coherent computational framework for integrating and drawing inferences from a collection of genome-wide measurements. Hence, the proposed research plan develops algorithms and computational tools for learning from heterogeneous data sets. We focus on the analysis of the yeast genome because so many genome-wide data sets are currently available; however, the tools we develop will be applicable to any genome. We approach this task using two recent trends from the field of machine learning: kernel algorithms that represent data via specialized similarity functions, and transductive algorithms that exploit the availability of unlabeled test data during the training phase of the algorithm. We apply focus on two tasks: (1) classifying groups of genes that are of interest to our collaborators, including components of the spindle pole body, cell cycle regulated genes, and genes involved in meiosis and sporulation, splicing, alcohol metabolism, etc., and (2) prediction of protein-protein interactions. These two specific aims are not only important scientific tasks, but also represent typical challenges that future genomic studies will face.

"In Silico Analysis of Ocular Genes and Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in computation and high-throughput methods of biomedical data collection have created tremendous opportunities to advance our understanding of visual physiology. We will test the hypothesis that genes and their protein products expressed in ocular tissues can be analyzed in silico using statistical and machine learning techniques and create knowledge regarding ocular gene regulation, structure and function. In particular, these studies will produce testable predictions that may be validated by bench experiments. A primary goal will be to characterize the regulatory elements that govern gene expression in ocular cells. In addition, these tools will be used to characterize ocular protein structure, particularly structure/function relationships and to make predictions about secondary and tertiary structure. Finally, in silico methods will be used to analyze the gene/protein networks that carry out cellular functions such as metabolism, signal transduction and regulation of gone expression. The following specific questions will be addressed in this research:      1) Can computational and statistical methods be used to identify DNA sequences that regulate   ocular gene expression? Can these sequences be used to identify new, uncharacterized   genes in the human genome?      2) Can these methods be used to predict protein structural features in both health and disease   states?      3) Can gene/protein functional networks be elucidated in silico by the use of advanced   analytical and modeling techniques?      This proposal describes a four year training program that aims to develop the independent research abilities of the PI, and to prepare for a career as an individual investigator in computational biology and translational medicine.         n/a",In Silico Analysis of Ocular Genes and Proteins,7082121,K08EY014665,"['DNA binding protein', 'biological signal transduction', 'computational biology', 'eye', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression', 'genetic library', 'genetic regulation', 'genetic regulatory element', 'glycoproteins', 'mathematical model', 'metabolism', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'protein structure function', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'silicon compounds', 'statistics /biometry', 'trabecular meshwork', 'vision']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K08,2006,42432,0.02559973695074926
"Novel Methylation Targets in Gastric Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular pathology of gastric carcinoma, the second most common cancer in the world, and of its precancerous precursor lesions has become much better elucidated in recent years, but much remains to be discovered. For example, tumor suppressor gene mutation, DNA hypermethylation, microsatellite instability (MSI), and altered gene expression have been shown to occur frequently during the origin and progression of this cancer. However, a greater understanding of these mechanisms and their timing in gastric carcinogenesis could lead to the ultimate development of early detection and staging biomarkers, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to this deadly disease. Therefore, in order to deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying gastric carcinogenesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) To compare and contrast the global gene expression patterns of various subtypes and premalignant stages of gastric cancer, using cDNA microarrays and bioinformatics algorithms. 1a) cDNA microarrays will be produced and hybridized to amplified RNA from various histologic subtypes and premalignant stage precursor lesions of gastric cancer. 1b) The bioinformatics programs Cluster/Treeview, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs) will be used to derive global gene expression patterns for each subtype of gastric cancer or precursor lesion. During this process, we will also identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed among the various subgroups. 2) To perform a limited methylotyping assay to ascertain epigenetic signatures of different types of gastric cancer and premalignant lesions, focusing on known as well as novel CpG islands in the promoter or upstream regions of genes. 2a) Known methylation targets will be analyzed, including E-cadherin (CDH 1), p 16, p 15, p 14-ARF, death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), human mutL homolog 1 (hMLH1), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), RASSFIA, deleted in colon carcinoma (DCC), and 14-3-3-sigma. 2b) Novel methylation target searches will be performed using CpG island microarrays, with alternative backup approaches to include methylation-sensitive genomic DNA digestion followed by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR), as well as single-gene MSP. 3) To correlate the results of, aims (1) and (2) with each other as well as with other clinical and biologic parameters of these gastric lesions. n/a",Novel Methylation Targets in Gastric Cancer,6949187,R21CA098450,"['CpG islands', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'carcinogenesis', 'carcinoma', 'gene expression', 'human subject', 'methylation', 'microarray technology', 'molecular oncology', 'molecular pathology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid hybridization', 'patient oriented research', 'stomach neoplasms']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2005,148500,0.011893810383138257
"Clinical & Microarray Data Predict Lung Cancer Outcomes Patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) have a poor prognosis. Our goal is to develop methods to translate gene expression profiles into knowledge that will lead to the identification of molecular targets for prediction and therapy in these patients.

"Multi-Agent Collaboration for AMD Subtype Classification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in developed countries and as such represents a very significant public health problem a number of specific genes, and the discovery, characterization, and eventual therapeutic control of these genes represent major goals of the vision research community. Although the strategies for gene discovery have become very powerful in recent years, there remains a major obstacle to the discovery of genes that underlie common, late-onset diseases like AMD. That obstacle is that clinicians cannot reliably sort patients with different molecular subtypes of late-onset disease into sufficiently homogeneous groups. The purpose of this project is to use the power of multi-agent systems computer technology in a novel way to aid clinicians in the collaborative development of a robust classification system based upon the ophthalmoscopic features of AMD. The result of this project will contribute to an NIH's Innovations in Biomedical Information and Science and Technology Program goal of speeding the progress of biomedical research through the development tools for electronic collaboration that will have impact on broader areas of biomedical research.   We hypothesize that a multi-agent approach to this problem will result in a classification system with greater reproducibility and discriminative power than a system developed by clinicians without such computer assistance. The availability of populations of AMD patients with lower molecular complexity will significantly increase the power of statistical techniques for AMD gene discovery. In addition to this immediate and specific benefit, the strategies we will develop during this project for objectively interfacing medical experts with each other as well as with computers will have applications in the search for other late-onset disease genes as well as in the development of multi-center and multidisciplinary clinical trials of new therapeutic approaches. The proposed system, the Intelligent Distributed Ontology Consensus system (IDOCS) goes beyond conventional groupware by addressing drawbacks to direct, synchronous interaction by providing an autonomously coordinated, asynchronous interaction and collaboration platform among clinicians through their representative intelligent agents.

By simultaneously looking at data on gene expression and metabolite concentrations, a more accurate and complete picture of cellular behavior can be determined. Using statistical and mathematical algorithms applied to high throughput data, toxicant exposure characterization will be computed including identification of type of exposure and estimates of dose amount.

"The Molecular Pathogenesis of Health Disparities in Inf* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of preterm labor have been well documented, but the relative impact of genetic predisposition, as compared to environmental and behavioral factors is not known. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that differential gene expression contributes to disparity in infection-associated preterm labor. A second objective is the creation of two large and novel resources for studying preterm labor: (1) a database of candidate critical genes, and, (2) a human gene expression tissue bank. We suggest that elucidating the pathophysiology of preterm labor requires the power to perform analyses of the fetomaternal interactions required for parturition on a genomic scale. For practical and ethical reasons, a primary study of this type in humans would be severely limited. Therefore, in the first phase of this project, we will use a validated, tightly controlled murine model of infection-induced preterm labor to generate a comprehensive catalogue of gene expression over time in multiple tissues. Preterm pregnant mice will be randomized to treatment groups modeling one of clinical conditions: A. infection with labor; B. infection without labor; C. labor without infection; and D. no infection/no labor. RNA will then be collected from myometrium, ovaries, decidua, placentas and fetal membranes from each of the groups in a time series, and the relative expression of thousands of genes will be analyzed in these samples using DNA microarrays. A similarity metric and a clustering algorithm will be used to categorize individual genes by temporal expression patterns. A novel subtractive strategy will allow us to differentiate transcripts active specifically in infection-induced from those important for infection or labor alone. Inferences will be drawn regarding the involvement of genes not physic represented in the micro arrays by mapping into known functional pathways. The final result of this analysis will be a ""short list"" of candidate genes with potentially critical roles in infection-induced labor. In the second phase of the project, we analyze human tissues (myometrium, placenta, chorion, amnion, decidua, amniocytes and blood) collected from approximately 1360 patients presenting in term and preterm labor in a cross-sectional case-control study matching for race. Expression analysis in these tissues will be targeted to the human homologues of the enriched list of candidate critical genes identified in the mouse. Differential gene expression in pre term labor with or without infection and premature rupture membranes, as well as among different racial groups, will be characterized. A computational tool known as a support vector machine will be used to generate a rank order list predictive of preterm delivery, taking into account historical, clinical and laboratory variables. This tool will identify the subset(s) of genes most likely to form the genetic basis of preterm labor, and may provide a diagnostic molecular profiling instrument for predicting preterm delivery. The large databases generated in this study will be valuable to any researcher interested in parturition and will be made accessible on the Internet. n/a",The Molecular Pathogenesis of Health Disparities in Inf*,6929305,R01HD041689,"['DNA', 'Escherichia coli', 'RNA', 'bacteria infection mechanism', 'decidua', 'disease /disorder model', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'embryo /fetus membrane', 'epidemiology', 'female', 'gene expression', 'genetic susceptibility', 'human tissue', 'induced labor', 'infection', 'laboratory mouse', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'myometrium', 'ovary', 'pathologic process', 'placenta', 'premature labor', 'racial /ethnic difference', 'tissue /cell culture']",NICHD,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2005,300000,0.07504417713769763

"Novel Methylation Targets in Gastric Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular pathology of gastric carcinoma, the second most common cancer in the world, and of its precancerous precursor lesions has become much better elucidated in recent years, but much remains to be discovered. For example, tumor suppressor gene mutation, DNA hypermethylation, microsatellite instability (MSI), and altered gene expression have been shown to occur frequently during the origin and progression of this cancer. However, a greater understanding of these mechanisms and their timing in gastric carcinogenesis could lead to the ultimate development of early detection and staging biomarkers, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to this deadly disease. Therefore, in order to deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying gastric carcinogenesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) To compare and contrast the global gene expression patterns of various subtypes and premalignant stages of gastric cancer, using cDNA microarrays and bioinformatics algorithms. 1a) cDNA microarrays will be produced and hybridized to amplified RNA from various histologic subtypes and premalignant stage precursor lesions of gastric cancer. 1b) The bioinformatics programs Cluster/Treeview, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs) will be used to derive global gene expression patterns for each subtype of gastric cancer or precursor lesion. During this process, we will also identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed among the various subgroups. 2) To perform a limited methylotyping assay to ascertain epigenetic signatures of different types of gastric cancer and premalignant lesions, focusing on known as well as novel CpG islands in the promoter or upstream regions of genes. 2a) Known methylation targets will be analyzed, including E-cadherin (CDH 1), p 16, p 15, p 14-ARF, death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), human mutL homolog 1 (hMLH1), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), RASSFIA, deleted in colon carcinoma (DCC), and 14-3-3-sigma. 2b) Novel methylation target searches will be performed using CpG island microarrays, with alternative backup approaches to include methylation-sensitive genomic DNA digestion followed by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR), as well as single-gene MSP. 3) To correlate the results of, aims (1) and (2) with each other as well as with other clinical and biologic parameters of these gastric lesions. n/a",Novel Methylation Targets in Gastric Cancer,6770192,R21CA098450,"['CpG islands', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'carcinogenesis', 'carcinoma', 'gene expression', 'human subject', 'methylation', 'microarray technology', 'molecular oncology', 'molecular pathology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid hybridization', 'patient oriented research', 'stomach neoplasms']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2004,148500,0.011893810383138257
"Clinical & Microarray Data Predict Lung Cancer Outcomes Patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) have a poor prognosis. Our goal is to develop methods to translate gene expression profiles into knowledge that will lead to the identification of molecular targets for prediction and therapy in these patients. Current clinical (staging) models for prediction of survival in these patients with small, localized tumors (Stage I) fails to identify the subset that will die less than 2.5 years after ""curative"" surgery. Our preliminary research with rule-based models using Stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients demonstrates meaningful results for prediction of survival with models that combine gene expression data with clinical data. Our primary hypothesis is: Clinical and gene expression attributes combine in rule-based models to accurately predict patient outcomes (time to death or recurrence). We propose to test this hypothesis for patients with resectable NSCLC. The Specific Aims are to: 1. Test the accuracy of the rule-based models as a function of the data type. We will use several established algorithms for generating decision rule models. Leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) will be used to evaluate model accuracy, complexity, and stability. The ""gold standard"" for performance comparison is the AJCC staging model. 2. Compare the model performance for rule-based induction to other algorithms. We will use support vector machines and artificial neural networks. We will address the role of feature selection in model performance. We will also confirm the significance of model variables using a standard statistical metric, partial least squares. We will also experimentally evaluate (random and adaptive) subsampling methods (bagging and boosting, respectively), which vote multiple rule models produced by one rule-based system, C4.5. 3. Research rule induction to hypothesize causal mechanisms in survival. We will develop a novel extension to rule induction that we call backward-chaining rule induction, a form of ""semi-supervised"" learning, which we expect to better focus the search for variable interactions to ""interesting"" rules (i.e., those with mechanistic explanations), than purely unsupervised approaches.

"Multi-Agent Collaboration for AMD Subtype Classification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in developed countries and as such represents a very significant public health problem a number of specific genes, and the discovery, characterization, and eventual therapeutic control of these genes represent major goals of the vision research community. Although the strategies for gene discovery have become very powerful in recent years, there remains a major obstacle to the discovery of genes that underlie common, late-onset diseases like AMD. That obstacle is that clinicians cannot reliably sort patients with different molecular subtypes of late-onset disease into sufficiently homogeneous groups. The purpose of this project is to use the power of multi-agent systems computer technology in a novel way to aid clinicians in the collaborative development of a robust classification system based upon the ophthalmoscopic features of AMD. The result of this project will contribute to an NIH's Innovations in Biomedical Information and Science and Technology Program goal of speeding the progress of biomedical research through the development tools for electronic collaboration that will have impact on broader areas of biomedical research.   We hypothesize that a multi-agent approach to this problem will result in a classification system with greater reproducibility and discriminative power than a system developed by clinicians without such computer assistance. The availability of populations of AMD patients with lower molecular complexity will significantly increase the power of statistical techniques for AMD gene discovery. In addition to this immediate and specific benefit, the strategies we will develop during this project for objectively interfacing medical experts with each other as well as with computers will have applications in the search for other late-onset disease genes as well as in the development of multi-center and multidisciplinary clinical trials of new therapeutic approaches.

"Integrated SNP, gene expression and proteomic analysis This project will see development of a software suite (Genetrix) comprised of tools for data management, visualization, machine learning, statistical analysis and biologic interpretation of data from the large-scale biological platforms (gene expression, SNP and proteomics), in conjunction with ancillary clinical, demographic, epidemiological, laboratory and outcome data. The bioinformatics challenges of the new large-scale biotechnologies and formidable: efficient mining of biologically- and clinically-relevant information requires coordinated contributions from computer scientists, statisticians, mathematicians, biologists and clinicians.

"The Molecular Pathogenesis of Health Disparities in Inf* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of preterm labor have been well documented, but the relative impact of genetic predisposition, as compared to environmental and behavioral factors is not known. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that differential gene expression contributes to disparity in infection-associated preterm labor. A second objective is the creation of two large and novel resources for studying preterm labor: (1) a database of candidate critical genes, and, (2) a human gene expression tissue bank. We suggest that elucidating the pathophysiology of preterm labor requires the power to perform analyses of the fetomaternal interactions required for parturition on a genomic scale. For practical and ethical reasons, a primary study of this type in humans would be severely limited. Therefore, in the first phase of this project, we will use a validated, tightly controlled murine model of infection-induced preterm labor to generate a comprehensive catalogue of gene expression over time in multiple tissues. Preterm pregnant mice will be randomized to treatment groups modeling one of clinical conditions: A. infection with labor; B. infection without labor; C. labor without infection; and D. no infection/no labor. RNA will then be collected from myometrium, ovaries, decidua, placentas and fetal membranes from each of the groups in a time series, and the relative expression of thousands of genes will be analyzed in these samples using DNA microarrays. A similarity metric and a clustering algorithm will be used to categorize individual genes by temporal expression patterns. A novel subtractive strategy will allow us to differentiate transcripts active specifically in infection-induced from those important for infection or labor alone. Inferences will be drawn regarding the involvement of genes not physic represented in the micro arrays by mapping into known functional pathways. The final result of this analysis will be a ""short list"" of candidate genes with potentially critical roles in infection-induced labor. In the second phase of the project, we analyze human tissues (myometrium, placenta, chorion, amnion, decidua, amniocytes and blood) collected from approximately 1360 patients presenting in term and preterm labor in a cross-sectional case-control study matching for race. Expression analysis in these tissues will be targeted to the human homologues of the enriched list of candidate critical genes identified in the mouse. Differential gene expression in pre term labor with or without infection and premature rupture membranes, as well as among different racial groups, will be characterized. A computational tool known as a support vector machine will be used to generate a rank order list predictive of preterm delivery, taking into account historical, clinical and laboratory variables. This tool will identify the subset(s) of genes most likely to form the genetic basis of preterm labor, and may provide a diagnostic molecular profiling instrument for predicting preterm delivery. The large databases generated in this study will be valuable to any researcher interested in parturition and will be made accessible on the Internet. n/a",The Molecular Pathogenesis of Health Disparities in Inf*,6776475,R01HD041689,"['DNA', 'Escherichia coli', 'RNA', 'bacteria infection mechanism', 'decidua', 'disease /disorder model', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'embryo /fetus membrane', 'epidemiology', 'female', 'gene expression', 'genetic susceptibility', 'human tissue', 'induced labor', 'infection', 'laboratory mouse', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'myometrium', 'ovary', 'pathologic process', 'placenta', 'premature labor', 'racial /ethnic difference', 'tissue /cell culture']",NICHD,NORTHSHORE UNIV HEALTHSYSTEM RES INST,R01,2004,300000,0.07504417713769763

"Detecting relations among heterogeneous genomic datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past decade, the new focus on genomics has highlighted a particular challenge: to integrate the different views of the genome that are provided by various types of experimental data.

Hence, the proposed research plan develops algorithms and computational tools for learning from heterogeneous data sets. We focus on the analysis of the yeast genome because so many genome-wide data sets are currently available; however, the tools we develop will be applicable to any genome. We approach this task using two recent trends from the field of machine learning: kernel algorithms that represent data via specialized similarity functions, and transductive algorithms that exploit the availability of unlabeled test data during the training phase of the algorithm.

"GenePattern: Methodologies and Software Tools.  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years there have been exciting breakthroughs in the application of computational methods to problems in cancer genomics. Machine learning techniques applied to gene expression data have been used to address the questions of distinguishing tumor morphology, predicting post-treatment outcome, and finding molecular markers for disease. While these studies have been very promising, significant challenges remain. Extracting biological knowledge from microarray-based gene expression data is difficult. The development of robust and accurate expression-based classifiers of biological and clinical states is similarly problematic. Biologists do not have access to an integrated set of robust, sophisticated analytical tools.  Our goal is to develop, implement, and distribute computational genomics methods that address these challenges in the gene expression profiling field.  Aim 1: Capture the behavior of a set of genes representing a pathway or state of the cell to reduce a list of thousands of expressed genes into a few hundred metagenes. Metagenes should filter the noise, technical variation, and idiosyncrasies of the data, and capture the actual molecular logic or relevant biological correlations and structure in the data.  Aim 2: Develop a robust and validated computational methodology for using metagene markers for classification.  Aim 3: Develop and distribute an integrated software package, GenePattern, to put the power of sophisticated computational methods into the hands of the biomedical research community.

The proposed system, the Intelligent Distributed Ontology Consensus system (IDOCS) goes beyond conventional groupware by addressing drawbacks to direct, synchronous interaction by providing an autonomously coordinated, asynchronous interaction and collaboration platform among clinicians through their representative intelligent agents. IDOCS will provide a generic meta-data infrastructure using XMLJRDF to make it easily configurable for other diseases.   n/a",Multi-Agent Collaboration for AMD Subtype Classification,6549357,R33EY013688,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' disease /disorder classification', ' disease /disorder etiology', ' human subject', ' informatics', ' interdisciplinary collaboration', ' macular degeneration', ' mathematics', ' pathologic process', ' phenotype']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R33,2003,259228,0.007859200243500432
"Predicting gene attributes from patterns of annotations. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Gene Ontology Consortium produces a controlled vocabulary for annotation of gene functions, which has been adopted by many organism-specific gene annotation databases. This allows the prediction of gene function based on partial annotation: if two attributes are strongly correlated in a database, then the presence of one attribute is evidence for the presence of the other. Recent ideas from machine learning, such as dependency networks, may allow more complicated interdependencies between genes and their attributes to be modeled efficiently, which should enable better predictions to be made. Cross-validation will be used to assess the performance of these models, in comparison with linear models and baseline models in which attributes are assumed to be independent. This approach will also be integrated with a probabilistic model of annotation-transfer based on sequence similarity. n/a",Predicting gene attributes from patterns of annotations.,6626288,F32HG002552,"['computer data analysis', ' computer graphics /printing', ' functional /structural genomics', ' genetic models', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' molecular biology information system', ' postdoctoral investigator']",NHGRI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY (MEDICAL SCHOOL),F32,2003,46420,0.0500190152187264
"The Molecular Pathogenesis of Health Disparities in Inf* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of preterm labor have been well documented, but the relative impact of genetic predisposition, as compared to environmental and behavioral factors is not known. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that differential gene expression contributes to disparity in infection-associated preterm labor. A second objective is the creation of two large and novel resources for studying preterm labor: (1) a database of candidate critical genes, and, (2) a human gene expression tissue bank. We suggest that elucidating the pathophysiology of preterm labor requires the power to perform analyses of the fetomaternal interactions required for parturition on a genomic scale. For practical and ethical reasons, a primary study of this type in humans would be severely limited. Therefore, in the first phase of this project, we will use a validated, tightly controlled murine model of infection-induced preterm labor to generate a comprehensive catalogue of gene expression over time in multiple tissues. Preterm pregnant mice will be randomized to treatment groups modeling one of clinical conditions: A. infection with labor; B. infection without labor; C. labor without infection; and D. no infection/no labor. RNA will then be collected from myometrium, ovaries, decidua, placentas and fetal membranes from each of the groups in a time series, and the relative expression of thousands of genes will be analyzed in these samples using DNA microarrays. A similarity metric and a clustering algorithm will be used to categorize individual genes by temporal expression patterns. A novel subtractive strategy will allow us to differentiate transcripts active specifically in infection-induced from those important for infection or labor alone. Inferences will be drawn regarding the involvement of genes not physic represented in the micro arrays by mapping into known functional pathways. The final result of this analysis will be a ""short list"" of candidate genes with potentially critical roles in infection-induced labor. In the second phase of the project, we analyze human tissues (myometrium, placenta, chorion, amnion, decidua, amniocytes and blood) collected from approximately 1360 patients presenting in term and preterm labor in a cross-sectional case-control study matching for race. Expression analysis in these tissues will be targeted to the human homologues of the enriched list of candidate critical genes identified in the mouse. Differential gene expression in pre term labor with or without infection and premature rupture membranes, as well as among different racial groups, will be characterized. A computational tool known as a support vector machine will be used to generate a rank order list predictive of preterm delivery, taking into account historical, clinical and laboratory variables. This tool will identify the subset(s) of genes most likely to form the genetic basis of preterm labor, and may provide a diagnostic molecular profiling instrument for predicting preterm delivery.

"In Silico Analysis of Ocular Genes and Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in computation and high-throughput methods of biomedical data collection have created tremendous opportunities to advance our understanding of visual physiology. We will test the hypothesis that genes and their protein products expressed in ocular tissues can be analyzed in silico using statistical and machine learning techniques and create knowledge regarding ocular gene regulation, structure and function. In particular, these studies will produce testable predictions that may be validated by bench experiments. A primary goal will be to characterize the regulatory elements that govern gene expression in ocular cells. In addition, these tools will be used to characterize ocular protein structure, particularly structure/function relationships and to make predictions about secondary and tertiary structure. Finally, in silico methods will be used to analyze the gene/protein networks that carry out cellular functions such as metabolism, signal transduction and regulation of gone expression. The following specific questions will be addressed in this research:      1) Can computational and statistical methods be used to identify DNA sequences that regulate   ocular gene expression? Can these sequences be used to identify new, uncharacterized   genes in the human genome?      2) Can these methods be used to predict protein structural features in both health and disease   states?      3) Can gene/protein functional networks be elucidated in silico by the use of advanced   analytical and modeling techniques?      This proposal describes a four year training program that aims to develop the independent research abilities of the PI, and to prepare for a career as an individual investigator in computational biology and translational medicine.         n/a",In Silico Analysis of Ocular Genes and Proteins,6605943,K08EY014665,"['DNA binding protein', ' biological signal transduction', ' eye', ' functional /structural genomics', ' gene expression', ' genetic library', ' genetic regulation', ' genetic regulatory element', ' glycoproteins', ' mathematical model', ' metabolism', ' molecular biology information system', ' nucleic acid sequence', ' protein structure function', ' serial analysis of gene expression', ' silicon compounds', ' statistics /biometry', ' trabecular meshwork', ' vision']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K08,2003,166328,0.02559973695074926
"CIPER--A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATOR INVOLVED IN CANCER Dysfunction of apoptotic pathways plays a critical role in the development of cancer, and the identification and characterization of genes encoding regulators of apoptosis is therefore critical for understanding the pathophysiology of cancer and for developing novel therapeutic approaches. The laboratory has identified CIPER, a gene that regulates both apoptosis and the NF-kB signal transduction pathway, one which is associated with cell survival. Because of this dual function, CIPER appears to play an important role as the control point of a molecular decision-tree; under some circumstances, CIPER may promote apoptosis, while at other times CIPER may favor cell survival. Importantly, the CIPER gene has been found to be located at the chromosomal breakpoint region of t(1;14), a recurrent translocation associated with MALT B-cell lymphoma, and is frequently mutated in lymphomas of various other histologic types as well as some non-lymphoid neoplasms. Our hypothesis is that CIPER promotes tumor development through a combination of dysregulated apoptosis and NF-kB signaling which result from chromosomal mutations affecting the CIPER gene. We are proposing a series of aims to further define the molecular mechanisms by which CIPER controls these signaling pathways, to understand the cellular stimulae which influence CIPER function, and to explore how natural mutations in the CIPER gene affect its important role as a regulator of cell survival.  n/a",CIPER--A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATOR INVOLVED IN CANCER,6463554,F32CA088470,"['B cell lymphoma', ' apoptosis', ' biological signal transduction', ' chromosome translocation', ' gene mutation', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neoplastic transformation', ' nuclear factor kappa beta', ' phosphoproteins', ' regulatory gene', ' tissue /cell culture']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2002,33997,0.016513105660422737

"INTELLIGENT MAPPING OF GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES As a step toward understanding the complex differences between normal and cancer cells, much research has been devoted to analyses of genes that are differentially expressed in particular cells.  Though recent technological advances have made it possible to conduct serial and/or simultaneous analysis of the expression patterns of thousands of genes, no comprehensive study has been reported on how many genes are expressed differentially and whether most differences are cell line-specific.  The long- term goal of this research is to develop intelligent data mapping and visual explanation technologies to improve information exploration and interpretation from high-throughput gene expression profiles for molecular analysis of cancer. Suggested by preliminary evidence from mRNA profiles of breast/prostate cancer cells that transcriptome patterns are rich in information about mechanisms that underlie cancer development, in the R21 research, multidisciplinary knowledge of molecular biology and computational intelligence are applied to (1) design cost effective molecular experiments to establish gene transcriptome distributions across cell lines, (2) pilot test the existence of transcriptome clusters in the molecular species space that correlate to cell phenotypes, and (3) identify key biomarkers that differentiate different cell lines with the highest prediction values.  Since new knowledge can only be further acquired by exploring all of the interesting aspects of complex transcriptome data in high-dimensional space, in this R33 application a statistically principled hierarchical visual exploration technique is proposed to effectively reveal and interpret the intrinsic but hidden characteristics of transcriptome clusters that should better define the nature of cancer biology and therapeutic targets.  A novel integration of information theory and computer graphics will permit (1) an automatic identification and modeling of biomarker clusters, (2) a probabilistic component analysis to form hierarchical visualization spaces allowing the complete data set to be analyzed at the top level with best separated sub-clusters analyzed at deeper levels, and (3) an interactive intelligent interface for task/hypothesis driven data mining and decision making.  The innovative nature of the research relies on the concept of combining (1) a hybrid stepwise nonlinear discriminant analysis for biomarker identification and (2) a hierarchical visual exploration of multi-foci high-dimensional transcriptome distribution to interpret the complex relationships between molecular events and cell phenotypes.  n/a",INTELLIGENT MAPPING OF GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES,6522340,R33CA083231,"['breast neoplasms', ' computer simulation', ' estrogen inhibitor', ' gene expression', ' genetic mapping', ' genetic markers', ' genetic screening', ' genetic transcription', ' information display', ' information theory', ' mathematical model', ' messenger RNA', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' phenotype', ' prostate neoplasms', ' statistics /biometry', ' structural biology', ' technology /technique development', ' transcription factor']",NCI,CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF AMERICA,R33,2002,122438,0.007082656029520551

"FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPING CEREBELLUM   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Granule cell precursors of the cerebellum        undergo exuberant proliferation and subsequent differentiation during postnatal      days 1-21 (Pl-21) in the mouse. Granule cells are also thought, to give rise to      medulloblastoma, a brain tumor primarily affecting children. This proposal is        aimed at characterizing gene expression profiles during the highly                   proliferative phase of cerebellar development in the postnatal mouse. Existing       analytical methods for elucidating the functional relationships between genes        expressed in cells typically fall to account for significant sources of              variation (i.e., ""noise"") inherent in the data. This problem will only be            compounded as analysis progresses from unicellular organisms to complex tissues      such as the developing CNS. The hypothesis driving the proposed research plan        is that improved classification and clustering techniques in functional              genomics can be obtained by incorporating sources of variation/noise into the        analytic method. The proposed work will utilize a model system of the                developing mouse cerebellum, from which improved methods for the interpretation      of complex, DNA microarray-based gene expression data will be developed.                                                                                                  Aim 1 is to generate a gene expression data set (consisting of the analysis of       19,000 genes) from the newborn and neonatal mouse cerebellum at various              developmental stages (P1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, 21, 30). Math-1 is a basic               helix-loop-helix transcription factor with essential roles in cerebellar             granule cell development. We will utilize transgenic mice in which selectable        reporter genes (e.g., jellyfish green fluorescent protein, GFP) are expressed        under control of the granule precursor cell-specific Math-1 enhancer. This will      allow for further subdivision into proliferating, immature granule cell              (Math-1-positive) and other cell types (Math-1-negative) by fluorescent cell         activated sorting (FACS). Aim 2- The time series obtained in Aim 1 will be           analyzed in both the time and frequency domain, using Fourier transforms of the      expression data. Classification and clustering techniques that fully exploit         the ""noise models"" developed in Aim 1 will be applied to these time series. In       Aim 3 we will screen candidate genes/ESTs to confirm appropriate                     spatio-temporal-specific expression in developing cerebellar granule cells from      P0-P21 using a high throughput in situ hybridization protocol. Deliverables          from the work include an open source, public domain, web-accessible tool kit of      noise-aware machine learning (classification and clustering) tools that are          anticipated to be widely applicable to the analysis of time series of gene           expression networks in complex biological systems. In addition, it is                anticipated that candidate genes with possible roles in cerebellar granule cell      proliferation, differentiation or possibly, tumorigenesis, will emerge that can      be analyzed in future hypothesis-driven projects.                                                                                                                         n/a",FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPING CEREBELLUM,6394443,R21NS041764,"['artificial intelligence', ' cerebellum', ' developmental genetics', ' developmental neurobiology', ' flow cytometry', ' functional /structural genomics', ' genetically modified animals', ' granule cell', ' green fluorescent proteins', ' in situ hybridization', ' laboratory mouse', ' neurogenetics', ' reporter genes']",NINDS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE,R21,2001,229539,0.02240286468308469

"PATHOGENESIS OF HEALTH DISPARITIES IN PRETERM BIRTH DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of preterm labor have been well documented, but the relative impact of genetic predisposition, as compared to environmental and behavioral factors is not known. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that differential gene expression contributes to disparity in infection-associated preterm labor. A second objective is the creation of two large and novel resources for studying preterm labor: (1) a database of candidate critical genes, and, (2) a human gene expression tissue bank. We suggest that elucidating the pathophysiology of preterm labor requires the power to perform analyses of the fetomaternal interactions required for parturition on a genomic scale. For practical and ethical reasons, a primary study of this type in humans would be severely limited. Therefore, in the first phase of this project, we will use a validated, tightly controlled murine model of infection-induced preterm labor to generate a comprehensive catalogue of gene expression over time in multiple tissues. Preterm pregnant mice will be randomized to treatment groups modeling one of clinical conditions: A. infection with labor; B. infection without labor; C. labor without infection; and D. no infection/no labor. RNA will then be collected from myometrium, ovaries, decidua, placentas and fetal membranes from each of the groups in a time series, and the relative expression of thousands of genes will be analyzed in these samples using DNA microarrays. A similarity metric and a clustering algorithm will be used to categorize individual genes by temporal expression patterns. A novel subtractive strategy will allow us to differentiate transcripts active specifically in infection-induced from those important for infection or labor alone. Inferences will be drawn regarding the involvement of genes not physic represented in the micro arrays by mapping into known functional pathways. The final result of this analysis will be a ""short list"" of candidate genes with potentially critical roles in infection-induced labor. In the second phase of the project, we analyze human tissues (myometrium, placenta, chorion, amnion, decidua, amniocytes and blood) collected from approximately 1360 patients presenting in term and preterm labor in a cross-sectional case-control study matching for race. Expression analysis in these tissues will be targeted to the human homologues of the enriched list of candidate critical genes identified in the mouse. Differential gene expression in pre term labor with or without infection and premature rupture membranes, as well as among different racial groups, will be characterized. A computational tool known as a support vector machine will be used to generate a rank order list predictive of preterm delivery, taking into account historical, clinical and laboratory variables. This tool will identify the subset(s) of genes most likely to form the genetic basis of preterm labor, and may provide a diagnostic molecular profiling instrument for predicting preterm delivery. The large databases generated in this study will be valuable to any researcher interested in parturition and will be made accessible on the Internet. n/a",PATHOGENESIS OF HEALTH DISPARITIES IN PRETERM BIRTH,6437197,R01HD041689,"['DNA', ' Escherichia coli', ' RNA', ' bacteria infection mechanism', ' decidua', ' disease /disorder model', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' embryo /fetus membrane', ' epidemiology', ' female', ' gene expression', ' genetic susceptibility', ' human tissue', ' induced labor', ' infection', ' laboratory mouse', ' microarray technology', ' molecular biology information system', ' myometrium', ' ovary', ' pathologic process', ' placenta', ' premature labor', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' tissue /cell culture']",NICHD,EVANSTON NORTHWESTERN HEALTHCARE RES INS,R01,2001,300000,0.0740117146576208
"FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPING CEREBELLUM   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Granule cell precursors of the cerebellum        undergo exuberant proliferation and subsequent differentiation during postnatal      days 1-21 (Pl-21) in the mouse. Granule cells are also thought, to give rise to      medulloblastoma, a brain tumor primarily affecting children. This proposal is        aimed at characterizing gene expression profiles during the highly                   proliferative phase of cerebellar development in the postnatal mouse. Existing       analytical methods for elucidating the functional relationships between genes        expressed in cells typically fall to account for significant sources of              variation (i.e., ""noise"") inherent in the data. This problem will only be            compounded as analysis progresses from unicellular organisms to complex tissues      such as the developing CNS. The hypothesis driving the proposed research plan        is that improved classification and clustering techniques in functional              genomics can be obtained by incorporating sources of variation/noise into the        analytic method. The proposed work will utilize a model system of the                developing mouse cerebellum, from which improved methods for the interpretation      of complex, DNA microarray-based gene expression data will be developed.                                                                                                  Aim 1 is to generate a gene expression data set (consisting of the analysis of       19,000 genes) from the newborn and neonatal mouse cerebellum at various              developmental stages (P1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, 21, 30). Math-1 is a basic               helix-loop-helix transcription factor with essential roles in cerebellar             granule cell development. We will utilize transgenic mice in which selectable        reporter genes (e.g., jellyfish green fluorescent protein, GFP) are expressed        under control of the granule precursor cell-specific Math-1 enhancer. This will      allow for further subdivision into proliferating, immature granule cell              (Math-1-positive) and other cell types (Math-1-negative) by fluorescent cell         activated sorting (FACS). Aim 2- The time series obtained in Aim 1 will be           analyzed in both the time and frequency domain, using Fourier transforms of the      expression data. Classification and clustering techniques that fully exploit         the ""noise models"" developed in Aim 1 will be applied to these time series. In       Aim 3 we will screen candidate genes/ESTs to confirm appropriate                     spatio-temporal-specific expression in developing cerebellar granule cells from      P0-P21 using a high throughput in situ hybridization protocol. Deliverables          from the work include an open source, public domain, web-accessible tool kit of      noise-aware machine learning (classification and clustering) tools that are          anticipated to be widely applicable to the analysis of time series of gene           expression networks in complex biological systems. In addition, it is                anticipated that candidate genes with possible roles in cerebellar granule cell      proliferation, differentiation or possibly, tumorigenesis, will emerge that can      be analyzed in future hypothesis-driven projects.                                                                                                                         n/a",FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPING CEREBELLUM,6291963,R21NS041764,"['artificial intelligence', ' cerebellum', ' developmental genetics', ' developmental neurobiology', ' flow cytometry', ' functional /structural genomics', ' genetically modified animals', ' granule cell', ' green fluorescent proteins', ' in situ hybridization', ' laboratory mouse', ' neurogenetics', ' reporter genes']",NINDS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE,R21,2000,216147,0.02240286468308469
"INNOVATIVE ALGORITHMS FOR MICROARRAY ANALYSIS   DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Description)  In order to better understand the           vast quantity of microarray data currently being generated in a number of            laboratories, new computational and analysis tools are needed. Pattern               analysis of thousands of simultaneously expressed genes will provide insight         into novel and progressive disease treatments. With the use of information           technology tools, substantial opportunities exist for improving the ability to       identify genetic anomalies. These tools will be critical in advancing the            automation and interpretation of experimental results.                                                                                                                    We will develop an innovative computer-based analytical tool called                  MicroExplore that will bring together multiple methods for analysis of               microarray data. Each method has unique properties that produce conceptually         different results. In the first phase, we propose to compare conceptual              clustering, hierarchical agglomerative and k-means algorithms. Evaluation of         the quality of data will be assessed through a combination of factors that           measure how well-known functional groupings are reflected in the output.             Efficiency and scalability will be measured through timed runs of MicroExplore       on a set of expression datasets of various sizes. Our study will focus on the        complex dataset of lymphoid gene expression belonging to an intramural NCI           laboratory. In the second phase, a novel hybrid approach will be designed to         utilize the results of multiple clustering algorithms and configurations to          achieve a ranked set of best overall clusters. Attempts to integrate external        data sources will add new dimensions to the analysis tool and provide for            powerful predictions.                                                                                                                                                     Improving the scientist's ability to accurately and efficiently identify which       candidate genes would make good therapeutics will be a fundamental step for          the advancement of cancer research and scientific discovery. MicroExplore will       be a valuable resource for the continuance of gene discovery and                     characterization.

"CIPER--A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATOR INVOLVED IN CANCER Dysfunction of apoptotic pathways plays a critical role in the development of cancer, and the identification and characterization of genes encoding regulators of apoptosis is therefore critical for understanding the pathophysiology of cancer and for developing novel therapeutic approaches. The laboratory has identified CIPER, a gene that regulates both apoptosis and the NF-kB signal transduction pathway, one which is associated with cell survival. Because of this dual function, CIPER appears to play an important role as the control point of a molecular decision-tree; under some circumstances, CIPER may promote apoptosis, while at other times CIPER may favor cell survival. Importantly, the CIPER gene has been found to be located at the chromosomal breakpoint region of t(1;14), a recurrent translocation associated with MALT B-cell lymphoma, and is frequently mutated in lymphomas of various other histologic types as well as some non-lymphoid neoplasms. Our hypothesis is that CIPER promotes tumor development through a combination of dysregulated apoptosis and NF-kB signaling which result from chromosomal mutations affecting the CIPER gene. We are proposing a series of aims to further define the molecular mechanisms by which CIPER controls these signaling pathways, to understand the cellular stimulae which influence CIPER function, and to explore how natural mutations in the CIPER gene affect its important role as a regulator of cell survival.  n/a",CIPER--A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATOR INVOLVED IN CANCER,6208105,F32CA088470,"['B cell lymphoma', ' apoptosis', ' biological signal transduction', ' chromosome translocation', ' gene mutation', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neoplastic transformation', ' nuclear factor kappa beta', ' phosphoproteins', ' regulatory gene', ' tissue /cell culture']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2000,46300,0.016513105660422737

"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications.

"Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics specifically and potently block the expression of disease-related genes. siRNA clinical utility is currently limited to disease targets in the liver, but the Khvorova lab has developed a novel, fully chemically modified siRNA platform that enables delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and results in potent modulation of gene expression in mouse and monkey brain for 6 months. This technology provides an opportunity to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extensive chemical modification protects siRNAs from degradation and is essential for in vivo delivery, but lowers the gene silencing efficacy of many siRNA sequences. Bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict the activity of non-modified siRNAs, but these algorithms cannot predict whether a chemically modified siRNA will be functional. Identifying a hyperfunctional siRNA chemical modification pattern and developing a predictive algorithm for modified siRNA sequences will be critical for the widespread application of this platform in vivo to treat AD and other genetically-linked neurological disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify parameters that impact the silencing efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs. Aim 1 will identify the step(s) that limit the activity of chemically modified siRNAs. Using a validated AGO2- immunoprecipitation technique and a small RNA high-throughput sequencing protocol, loading of 32 chemically modified siRNA sequences, each with 3 different chemical modification patterns, into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) will be quantified, and these results will be compared to their in vitro silencing activity. These efforts will provide a data set to determine the impacts of chemistry and sequence on the different steps of RISC function. Aim 2 will design and screen 192 siRNAs in 6 different chemical modification patterns (i.e., for a total of 1152 siRNAs) to systematically assess if and how changes to siRNA sequence and chemical modification patterns impact siRNA efficacy. These 1152 siRNAs will target 4 different mRNAs identified as therapeutic targets for AD. Completing this aim will identify siRNAs that effectively reduce the expression of AD targets. Using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods, including multi-parameter linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, Aim 3 will model algorithms that specifically predict functional, chemically modified siRNAs. The best performing algorithm will be determined by independent and cross-validations. Completion of this project will decrease the extent of in vitro screening needed to identify functional chemically modified siRNAs capable of targeting disease genes in the CNS and streamline the design of siRNA therapies to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of genetic disorders. Chemical modification of siRNA is necessary for delivery to the central nervous system, but may hinder the efficacy of some siRNAs. This project will define the relationships between siRNA sequence, chemical modification patterns, and efficacy to streamline the development of clinically-relevant siRNAs capable of treating genetically-defined neurological disorders.",Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders,9992249,F31LM013111,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hela Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Huntington Disease', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Interference Therapy', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2020,30514,-0.026414375168635432

I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,10022122,F32GM134595,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fellowship', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Freedom', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'base', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'driving force', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human data', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical sciences', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,67446,0.03406727833133117
"Causal Effect Estimation of Regulatory Molecules Project Summary/Abstract Transcription factors and microRNAs are essential regulatory molecules (RM) that control messenger RNAs (mRNA) and are known to be dysregulated in human diseases. Each RM may affect multiple pathways of the cell which is both a blessing and a curse. If a therapy targets the proper RM, it can attack the disease from multiple fronts and increase efficacy. On the other hand, targeted therapy may result in serious adverse effects due to our limited knowledge of the downstream causal effect of RM manipulation. Although the local bindings between single RMs and their targets have been studied computationally and experimentally, the intensity of functional consequences of such bindings on the transcriptome is unclear. Here, I propose statistical machine learning techniques and causal inference methods to predict the observed variability of gene expression using only regulatory molecules and estimate their downstream causal effect on the entire transcriptome. To achieve this goal, I start in Aim 1 by building a multi-response predictive model to predict the whole transcriptome using only RMs. This goal is challenging because the dimension of the response vector is more than the number of samples and I will use techniques from high-dimensional statistics to address this issue. In Aim 2, I will go beyond predictive modeling by estimating the causal effect of RMs on the transcriptome using invariant causal prediction. I will leverage the rapidly growing literature which connects causal inference to invariant prediction accuracy across heterogeneous data sources to infer the causal effect of RMs on mRNA. Having developed both predictive and causal models of RMs contribution to gene regulation, in Aim 3 during the R00 phase, I will focus on the most recent advances in double/debiased machine learning which allows the use of scalable machine learning methods for reliable estimation of causal effect of RMs on transcription. My proposed research will bring the most advanced statistical machine learning and causal inference techniques to genomics research and help design more effective targeted therapies by providing insights into the global role of RMs in gene expression regulation. During the training phase of the award, with the support of my outstanding mentoring team and scientific advisory committee, I will gain expertise in molecular biology and genomics while perfecting my knowledge of causal inference and machine learning. The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – James Hospital and the Mathematical Biosciences Institute will provide me with the ideal interdisciplinary environment to bridge data science and genomics and will help me achieve my career development goals and transition to a tenure-track faculty position. Project Narrative Targeting regulatory elements has the advantage of concurrently attacking multiple damaged pathways, with the possible pitfall of toxicity due to adverse unintended effects. Understanding the functional global impact of therapy on the entire transcriptome will guide us in designing drugs with higher efficacy and lower toxicity.

"Systems Biology of Shape and Size Regulation Abstract The molecular regulation of body shape and size during development and regeneration involves numerous pathways precisely integrated together with the biophysical properties of cellular and tissue dynamics, a complex process poorly understood at the level of whole animals. The overall goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the genetic regulation and coordination of large-scale tissue growth by developing and applying a novel integrated systems biology approach. Combining in vivo experiments and their morphological formalization with machine learning of mathematical biophysical models, we will discern the molecular mechanisms that control growth, shape, and size regulation. We will leverage the robustness of the planarian worm to address the molecular and physical mechanisms regulating their extraordinary homeostatic and regenerative capacity to grow, degrow, and regenerate their whole-body shapes and organs from almost any amputation and across one order of magnitude in sizes. This work will develop novel computational systems biology methods and integrate them with whole-body gene expression imaging and surgical and genetic manipulations assays to elucidate the molecular regulators of body shape and size. Morphological, genetic, and surgical data will be formalized with novel mathematical ontologies, which will serve as input to new machine learning methods able to infer mechanistic gene regulatory networks. The regulatory networks will be quantitatively modeled with a novel mathematical continuous approach for whole-body biophysical simulation, including tissue growth, adhesion molecules, and gene regulation. This computational framework combining machine learning with biophysical modeling will be able to discover the mechanisms of growth and shape regulation from large formalized experimental datasets. Novel genetic interactions will be discovered by the machine learning methodology, which predictions in terms of morphological and gene expression outcomes resulting from genetic and surgical manipulations will be validated at the bench via RNAi and in situ hybridization assays. Integrating machine learning, biophysical mathematical modeling, ontological formalizations, and in vivo surgical and molecular assays represents a comprehensive systems biology approach for elucidating the regulation of shape and size. This work will provide a mechanistic understanding of the diverse genetic pathways that regulate tissue growth dynamics and how they interact precisely between them and with tissue biophysics to create and maintain whole-body scale targeted shapes and sizes. This work will pave the way for new applications and novel therapies in human developmental, regenerative, and cancer medicine. Project Narrative The genetic regulation of the shape and size of internal organs and whole body is crucial during development, regeneration, and homeostasis. This project will develop a novel integrated systems biology approach to elucidate mechanistically the molecular pathways and their coordination that control large-scale tissue growth dynamics in living organisms.

"Learning Dynamics of Biological Processes from Time Course Omics Datasets Complex biological processes, including organ development, immune response and disease progression, are inherently dynamic. Learning their regulatory architecture requires understanding how components of a large system dynamically interact with each other and give rise to emergent behavior. Recent experimental advances have made ii possible to investigate these biological systems in a data-driven fashion al high temporal resolution, allowing identification of new genes and their regulatory interactions. Longitudinal omics data sets are becoming increasingly common in clinical practice as well. Information on these collections of interacting genes can be integrated to gain systems-level insights into the roles of biological pathways and processes, including progression of diseases. Consequently, developing interpretable methods for learning functional relationships among genes, proteins or metabolites from high-dimensional time series data has become a timely research problem. The nature of these time-course data sets presents exciting opportunities and interesting challenges from a statistical perspective. Typical time-course omics data sets are challenging because of their high-dimensionality and non-linear relationships among system components. To tackle these challenges, one needs sophisticated dimension-reduction techniques that are biologically meaningful, computationally efficient and allow uncertainty quantification. Methods that incorporate prior biological information (e.g., pathway membership, protein-protein interactions) into the data analysis are good candidates for analyzing such high-dimensional systems using small samples. Here, we will develop three core methods to address the above challenges - (Aim 1): an empirical Bayes framework for clustering high-dimensional omics time-course data using prior biological knowledge; (Aim 2): a quantile-based Granger causality framework for learning interactions among genes or metabolites from their lead-lag relationships; and (Aim 3): a decision tree ensemble framework for searching cascades of interactions among genes from their temporal expression profiles. Our interdisciplinary team of statisticians and scientists will analyze time-course omics data from three research projects: (i) innate immune response systems in Drosophila, (ii) developmental process in mouse models, and (ii) longitudinal metabolite profiling of TB patients. These insights will be used to build and validate our methodology, which will be implemented in a publicly available software. This proposal is innovative in its incorporation of prior biological knowledge in the framework of novel dimension reduction techniques for interrogating high-dimensional time-course omics data. This research is significant in that it will impact basic sciences by elucidating data-driven, testable hypotheses on the regulatory architecture of biological processes, and clinical practice by monitoring disease progression and prognosis. n/a",Learning Dynamics of Biological Processes from Time Course Omics Datasets,10021429,R01GM135926,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Drosophila genus', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Grouping', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'clinical practice', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'open source', 'organ growth', 'outcome forecast', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'temporal measurement']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,344345,0.006570625373732238
"Computational Methods to Integrate and Interpret the Transcriptome from Single Cell and Tissue Level Data In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in discovery of genetic variants and genes associated with risk for psychiatric disorders. Altered gene expression in the brain, particularly at the cell-type-specific level, is believed to be a driving factor in conferring risk through these genetic variants. To link altered transcription to psychopathology, an immense amount of transcriptomic data is being accumulated, including single-cell and tissue level transcriptomes. Some of these samples cover critical developmental periods. An outstanding challenge is how to integrate single cell and tissue level transcriptomic data and how genetic variation alters transcription in specific cells to produce psychopathology. In this high dimensional ‘omics setting, we need powerful statistical and machine learning tools to produce integrative analyses and mesh those results with large psychiatric genetic datasets to achieve new insights. We propose to use our expertise in high dimensional statistical inference to tackle this challenge. We go beyond machine learning models that specialize in prediction, focusing instead on providing interpretable statistical inferences. We identify gene communities, defined in terms of cell type and spatiotemporal window, driving risk. With vast amounts of data comes great risk of spurious inferences based on non-rigorous analyses. On the other hand, reliable, but naïve tools can sacrifice power by not fully integrating all available information. Our overall objective to produce analytic tools that yield reliable and powerful inferences relating cell-type-specific gene expression with genetic risk factors. With these analytical tools made available to the research community, our longer-term goal is to hasten discoveries in the field and thus build the foundation from which therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders emerge. Our objectives will be accomplished with the following Specific aims: 1) statistically rigorous methods to select cell-type markers and to estimate cell-type-specific (CTS) expression, which will facilitate downstream analyses, including CTS eQTLs from tissue; 2) modeling dynamic gene communities throughout development of cell lineages or tissue and relating them to community-based-score statistics to gain insight into the impact of genetic risk factors on psychiatric disorders; and 3) novel methods for estimating gene co-expression networks from single cell RNA-seq. This contribution is significant because it will make many transcriptomic resources more valuable and enable downstream analyses, such as detection of CTS eQTLs in larger sample sets with higher power. Dynamic network analysis tools enhance our ability to identify gene communities that vary over developmental epochs and this variation facilitates inferences that relate cell type and developmental period with risk factors. The research proposed is innovative, in our opinion, because it uses novel statistical methods for integrative analysis of data from multiple sources, and cutting edge results to represent high dimensional data in a meaningful way that lends itself to clustering and network analysis. The statistical tools and results arising from the proposed research are relevant to public health because they will generate a deeper understanding of the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, the refined methods and new results provided by our research will be directly useful for the research community as they hunt for ways to prevent or treat mental disorders.",Computational Methods to Integrate and Interpret the Transcriptome from Single Cell and Tissue Level Data,10007193,R01MH123184,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'brain cell', 'case control', 'cell type', 'critical developmental period', 'gene discovery', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'prevent', 'psychogenetics', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,516076,0.004477790870387594
"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate.

"A next-generation morbid map of the human genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) on gene discovery and molecular diagnostics for Mendelian conditions (MCs) is hard to overstate. However, to provide affected individuals with precise natural history, recurrence risk, and prognosis in clinical settings, identification of pathogenic variant(s)/genotypes alone is often insufficient. This is a challenge most notably for genes that cause more than one MC or ~25% of all genes that underlie MCs. In such an instance, even with a known genotype a patient's phenotype has to be compared to that of all MCs caused by variants in a gene to determine which MC, if any, is the likely diagnosis or whether patient instead has a novel condition. This comparison is increasingly difficult because delineation of the ~5,100 MCs currently known has typically been based on subjective grouping of affected individuals by phenotypic similarity. We propose to develop a quantitative framework for assessing overlap among the distributions of phenotypes due to pathogenic genotypes the same gene and apply this framework genome-wide. NGS has enabled identification of causal genotypes in hundreds of thousands of individuals with MCs, providing a sufficiently large dataset that it is now feasible to use machine learning to quantitatively and systematically identify “clusters” of co-occurring genotypes and phenotypic features for each known gene. We will refine and validate our approach by comparing differences between conventionally-delineated and quantitatively-delineated MCs and by assessing the similarity of individuals with well-studied atypical phenotypes/genotypes to quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will then apply the optimal strategy across the genome to generate a “next- generation morbid map” based on quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will also apply machine learning approaches to identify genomic properties associated with the propensity for each gene to underlie multiple MCs (i.e., the numeric contribution of each gene to the morbid map or phenotropy). This will enable a more precise and complete understanding of the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of each MC, enable more objective diagnosis of individuals with atypical phenotypes, and more robustly identify the existence of multiple MCs among individuals with non-specific “class” phenotypes (e.g., developmental delay, autism, hearing impairment). We will make all newly developed methods publicly available via interactive and programmatic web-based tools to facilitate extension of this work to other human and model organism datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The major goals of this project are to develop a quantitative framework that enables objective delineation of Mendelian conditions, apply the framework to systematically delineate conditions across all genes known to underlie a Mendelian condition, and predict the number of conditions due to each gene. This framework will provide a fuller, unbiased characterization of the genotypic/phenotypic spectrum for all Mendelian conditions, enable more precise diagnoses and counseling of individuals with difficult to diagnose phenotypes, and accelerate the detection of new Mendelian conditions.",A next-generation morbid map of the human genome,10047366,R35HG011297,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'hearing impairment', 'large datasets', 'molecular diagnostics', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2020,466172,0.022128680590224284
"Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity Project Summary Our overarching goal is to understand how information characterizing genes and their function can be organized, integrated, and then generalized to new contexts. This is a central question of the post-genomic era, and one that becomes ever more pressing as novel assays expand the scope, breadth, and detail of information describing gene properties. While the Gene Ontology is the most prominent and universal system for organizing gene function, hundreds of others exist, often serving specialized research interests. Most laboratories depend on the validity of some subset of this data to design new experiments or interpret their results, but their quality is hard to directly ascertain, particularly in novel or complex integrative methodologies. Based on substantial preliminary data, we hypothesize that determining robustness and specificity will provide a highly general assessment of the utility of databases. We propose to use these properties to assess the entire corpus of resources organizing gene information, as well as the methods which exploit this information, and the results that they report. Critically, determining robustness and specificity does not require validation with respect to ‘gold standard’ information. By evaluating these resources with respect to their joint specificity and robustness we determine means of integrating and organizing their data for use in novel applications. Finally, we propose to apply our improvements in quality control to better target rare but robust results where this is an experimental goal, notably rare diseases and single cell expression. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Determine the uniqueness and robustness of data characterizing gene function. We develop a formal approach for characterizing robustness and uniqueness/specificity by exploiting prior probability in the form of gene multifunctionality. We will evaluate robustness and specificity across essentially all complex and structured databases characterizing genes. These measures can be compared between databases or over time and provide a global landscape of data structure. 2. Test methods designed to exploit information describing gene function. Statistical and machine learning methods exploiting structured data will be assessed for robust and specific output. Data features driving performance in diverse applications will be identified and complementary sources of data as well as community clusters will be defined. 3. Evaluate results that depended on the use of databases describing gene function. Using a combination of text-mining and figure-mining, we will assess the ongoing literature for novel, robust, and specific gene-function associations. We will characterize and evaluate the “dark matter” of gene-function association from both the point of unannotated genes as well as incomplete functions. Project Narrative Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene function in many different contexts and this data is captured in numerous resources which catalogue the varied properties of genes. The primary goal of this project is to explore and characterize the specificity and robustness of information about gene function within these databases. Because most biomedical experiments build on pre-existing knowledge, establishing guidelines for interpreting that data also has a large impact on our ability to understand novel results, particularly where they are unusual, as in many rare diseases.",Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity,9995573,R01LM012736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'comparative', 'dark matter', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2020,480000,0.05579578193340326
"Functional annotation of new genes aided by deep learning New genes (NGs) are generated by multiple mechanisms and their end-piece sequences are identified as the chimeric transcript sequence from multiple human sources including healthy and disease tissues. Therefore, NGs have been recognized as important biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precision medicine. Many efforts have been made to study individual NG function and to identify relevant drug targets. However, the current in-depth research and achievements are mainly concentrated on several driver NGs, and classical cancer drugs have been directly used to target the NG domains, such as the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 fusion protein in leukemia. Some of the fusion proteins with retaining DNA-binding domains such as transcription factors can directly bind their target genes, such as the EWSR1-FLI fusion actively recruiting BAF complex. Recently, the downstream effectors of driver FGs have emerged as therapeutic targets. For example, targeting the downstream CCND2 inhibited RUNX1/ETO-driven leukemic expansion in vitro and in vivo and inhibition of STAT5, the downstream factor of NUP214-ABL1 led to the induction of leukemia cell death. However, the functions of most identified FGs have not been systematically investigated. This is mainly due to the limitations of traditional tools and the high cost of experimental procedures. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new tools for analyzing NG breakpoint-specific features systemically in the human genome and predict their originating and regulatory mechanisms, such as upstream and downstream effectors. In-depth annotation based on NG structure is important for understanding the cellular mechanisms of NGs. Effective use of systematic bioinformatics tools for functional annotation can provide a deeper insight into the role of NGs in the development and progression of diseases such as cancers to find direct and indirect therapeutic targets. In this study, we will develop five bioinformatics tools for the functional annotation and feature analysis of NGs, a predictive pipeline for automatic analysis of downstream effects of NGs, and a predictive method for tracing the origin of NGs. This project will be a substantial contribution to public health by systematicallydeep annotating thefunction of new genes (NGs) in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. These systematic annotation results will be performed through ChimerAnno (a tool for functional annotation of human chimeric genes), FGviewer (a tool for visualizing multi-tiered functional features of fusion genes), NGeffector with DeepChIP (a tool for predicting NG downstream effectors with enhanced transcription factor binding site prediction with deep learning), DeepCLIP (a tool for providing evidence of origin of NGs for trans-splicing mechanism) and hBPAI (a tool for feature extraction of human new genes' breakpoint (BP)). The application of these approaches on all kinds of human BPs of new genes will be integrated into NewGeneDB, New Gene annotation Database. This study will advance our knowledge in NG regulatory mechanisms in diseases and open up the possibility of novel treatments of cancer tools and platforms for analyzing NGs. and other diseases in the future by providing powerful",Functional annotation of new genes aided by deep learning,10029297,R35GM138184,"['ABL1 gene', 'Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Markers', 'CCND2 gene', 'Cell Death', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'EWSR1 gene', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'NUP214 gene', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'RUNX1 gene', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Source', 'Stat5 protein', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Splicing', 'Transcript', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer therapy', 'chimeric gene', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'feature extraction', 'fusion gene', 'gene function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive tools', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R35,2020,334778,0.010570967466506752
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery. NARRATIVE The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project will facilitate translational research by integrating and mining data about understudied druggable targets from numerous repositories and other resources. The KMC for IDG team will develop novel tools to analyze these data for the purpose of finding connections between genes/proteins/targets and diseases/phenotypes, cells/tissues, pathways/gene-sets, and drugs/small-molecules in order to identify potential applications to treat diseases and for other biological contexts of clinical relevance.",Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome,9843449,U24CA224260,"['Achievement', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Ion Channel', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Social Network', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time trend', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'community center', 'computerized data processing', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data visualization', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'druggable target', 'genomic profiles', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'online community', 'outreach', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'repository', 'response', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning', 'web site']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2020,249999,0.010626104753266391
"The adaptive potential of translational regulation Project Summary/Abstract  Our current understanding of the adaptive effects of mutation is largely limited to alterations in protein coding sequence and disruption of transcriptional cis-regulatory promoters. Very little is known about how mutations alter translation, or the role these mutations play in adaptation and evolution. This project seeks to address this gap by identifying the functional effect of mutations on translation. To accomplish this I will first identify mutations that arise from adaptation to various nutrient limited environments. I will then use expression profiling (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and RATE-seq) to identify the effect these mutations have on translation, as well as other levels of gene expression. This will provide insight into the magnitude of effect mutations have on translation and their relative rate. Furthermore, to fully characterize the role synonymous mutations have on fitness I will be using a deep scanning synonymous mutation library. To understand the role tRNA abundance plays in the fitness effect of a given synonymous mutations, I will also be evaluating fitness within tRNA under- and over-expression backgrounds. Because of the closely coupled nature of translation rates and mRNA decay, I will also characterize the effect synonymous mutations have on mRNA decay using RATE-seq. My analysis of the functional effects of these mutations on gene expression, particularly within the genetic background and environment in which they arose, will allow for the development of a machine learning algorithm that can use sequence and annotation features to predict the effect of a mutation on gene expression. This tool will aid future research into the effect mutations have of gene expression by allowing the identification of high-confidence candidates for further evaluation.  This project will be conducted at New York University’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, whose mission is to answer otherwise intractable biological questions using applied experimental and computational approaches. The Center houses numerous facilities and cores that will be instrumental in the performance of this work. The collaborative atmosphere and multi-disciplinary nature of NYU’s research communities that will enable me to stay abreast of developments in related fields and to rapidly communicate my research to interested parties. I will be trained under the guidance of Dr. David Gresham, an excellent researcher working on complementing long-term evolution experiments with gene expression studies to characterize the adaptive potential of the regulation of gene expression. Project Narrative The translation of mRNA into protein is a critical step in gene expression that is tightly regulated with mis-regulation of translation being a hallmark of many human pathologies. Understanding how mutations can alter the regulation of translation is an understudied but important aspect of adaptation and evolution. Ultimately, without an understanding of the adaptive potential of translation we have an incomplete, and imperfect, picture of the underlying genetic causes of numerous forms of cancer and genetic diseases.",The adaptive potential of translational regulation,9893712,F32GM131573,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Pathology', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Nutrient', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathology', 'Performance at work', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Translation Initiation', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cancer genetics', 'collaborative environment', 'driver mutation', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'preservation', 'promoter', 'response', 'ribosome profiling', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,65310,0.02494011478727928
"Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits Project Summary  Over the past decade, data generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to analyze heritability of human diseases and complex traits to improve understanding of genetic architecture, including identifying the genetic variants associated with diseases and their effect sizes. These heritability enrichment analyses have revealed underlying biological mechanisms such as regulatory elements involved in disease pathways. This research proposes statistical methods and analysis to formally assess the contribution of biological pathways, gene networks, and re-prioritized functional annotations to the genetic architecture of 94 human diseases and complex traits. Better understanding of disease architecture will improve genome-wide associations and fine mapping and provides robust inference of disease etiology and mechanisms.  The first aim is to determine the contribution of disease-associated gene pathways to disease heritability. It is well known that an abnormality in individual genes rarely causes a human disease. Large-scale pathway analysis will elucidate disease pathways by constructing functional annotations and applying an existing polygenic method to partition heritability. Furthermore, pathway analyses on candidate genes identified via whole-exome sequencing (WES) data will inform new biological inference. The resulting set of enriched pathway-trait pairs will further help with independent validation of previously reported associations and for novel associations enriched for trait heritability.  The second aim is to determine the contribution of gene network to disease heritability across 94 diseases, focusing on hub genes defined by a broad set of network connectivity metrics. The contribution of gene network to disease heritability has been only partially answered, limited to few network connectivity metrics across 42 diseases. Comprehensive analysis of gene sets informed by published gene networks will inform a new direction of integrating gene networks to infer biological mechanisms of human diseases. In addition, visualization method for large-scale gene networks will greatly enhance research translation, serving as a useful resource for studying gene-gene interactions for potential drugs and therapeutic targets.  The third aim is to de-noise and re-prioritize Mendelian annotations to infer candidate genes. Despite considerable process on prioritizing rare variants impacting Mendelian diseases, little is known about the utility of these Mendelian pathogenicity scores for common disease. I will conduct heritability enrichment analyses to answer informativeness of Mendelian disease pathogenicity scores for common disease. To further improve their informativeness, I propose a machine learning variant reprioritization framework. Ultimately, this project will produce (1) a detailed understanding of disease-associated biological pathways to disease heritability, (2) a set of functional annotations informed by gene networks significantly enriched for disease heritability, and (3) a new method to prioritize variants and identifying candidate genes based on diverse genomic features. Project Narrative Understanding human genetic variations, from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to mutations, offers a great potential in uncovering underlying disease mechanisms by identifying new disease-associated genes and in discovering potential drug targets and therapeutics. This proposed studies aim to understand the role of these genetic variations in trait heritability, leveraging disease-associated biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations. The developed method to prioritize variants and genes will answer the contribution of gene pathways, gene sets informed by gene networks, and Mendelian pathogenicity scores to disease heritability.","Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits",9990520,F31HG010818,"['Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'denoising', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'fitness', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'open source', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2020,45520,0.016551219184286686
"Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo. ABSTRACT: “Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo”  microRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small regulatory RNAs involved in repression of gene expression. They recognize their target mRNAs though base pairing and upon binding, trigger translational repression, deadenylation and decay of the target mRNAs. Given that each miRNA has the potential to regulate hundreds of genes, and several dozens of miRNAs are expressed in each cell type, miRNAs are one of the master regulators of gene expression at post-transcriptional level in animals, plants and virus. Thus, the elucidation of the miRNA complement is essential to understand gene regulation and mRNA turnover. The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method for miRNA discovery and experimental validation in vivo.  Current miRNA discovery methods heavily rely on providing sequencing evidence of a small RNA that fits into a hairpin-like structure predicted bioinformatically. The problem is that sample availability or the abundance of a specific cell type in a tissue may be limited and hamper the number of miRNAs that can be backed-up with sequencing support. In these situations, the current solution is to sequence deeper, increasing overall costs. On the other hand, the presence of a small RNA of ~22-nt does not guarantee the belonging to the miRNA family, as random degradation of cellular RNAs also will produce small RNAs of this size and only tedious experimental validation of their processing into intermediate species and mature miRNA can confirm their identity.  A recent curation work found that of the over ~7,000 metazoan miRNAs in miRBase, the reference miRNA database, only 1,175 fulfilled the features necessary to pass as miRNAs, directly rejected 3,470 as false positives and lacked enough sequencing evidence to call another 2,105 miRNAs. Therefore, there is an unmet technological need to develop a miRNA validation method that boosts the access to the miRNA candidates even from limited samples and that allows rigorous multiplexed experimental validation of their processing.  With the synergy of an interdisciplinary team that combines expertise in microRNAs and zebrafish manipulation (Dr. Cifuentes, PI) and bioinformatics (Dr. Moxon, co-I), we will develop miRAGe (miRNA Analysis Genome wide), a high-throughput method to integrate miRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. The fundamental concept behind miRAGe is the use of living cells as “organic computers” to analyze miRNA processing. We will use massively parallel oligo pool synthesis to prepare the miRNA candidate precursors and test their processing in injected zebrafish embryos. Small RNA sequencing will determine which candidates are true microRNA by detecting their ~22-nucleotide mature product and their stereotypic intermediates.  Overall, the results from this project will transform the access of the scientific community to high quality, experimentally validated miRNA data from any organism with genomic data available, thus enhancing future transversal studies on post-transcriptional regulation. NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method to integrate microRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. We will take advantage of oligo pool synthesis to prepare the microRNA candidate precursors and test their processing after injection in zebrafish embryos.

"Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity Cortical GABAergic interneurons are critical components of neural circuitry, and their dysfunction has been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases. Although the diversity of interneurons is not disputed, both the extent of their heterogeneity and the gene regulatory mechanisms that drive it remain unclear. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing technology have shed new light on this issue, enabling the prediction of novel interneuron subtypes based on gene expression. Cross-species meta-analysis would provide key insight into conserved mechanisms of interneuron diversity. However, cross-study integration remains a major challenge. I hypothesize that interneuron identity is defined by unifying molecular processes across species. This project is designed to reveal these processes by using an integrative, cross-species approach to explore the transcriptional, epigenetic, and developmental mechanisms that govern interneuron diversity. First, I have shown that mouse interneuron subtypes replicably express genes associated with cell-cell communication, enabling cross-dataset meta-analysis. The goal of Aim 1 is to use improved computational and phylogenetic methods to define homologous interneuron subtypes across species and identify robust gene targets. Second, preliminary investigation of single cell methylome-sequencing data indicates that it can be readily aligned with expression data. In Aim 2 I will use machine learning methods to generate networks from epigenomic and expression data and identify subtype-specific regulatory features. Third, I have shown that transcriptional profiles from developing neurons can be quantitatively assessed with respect to adult expression data. Aim 3 will use meta-analytic aggregation of temporal inference methods to enable cross-dataset comparisons and define conserved developmental gene programs. These studies will reveal a multidimensional portrait of interneuron molecular identity and enable genetic access to these cell types, a key aim of the BRAIN Initiative. I also propose an extensive training plan that will support my transition to independence. CSHL provides an outstanding research environment, with unequaled opportunities for scientific discussion, advanced skills training and career development. I have assembled an exceptional team of collaborators and mentors who will help me to achieve my goals. Dr. Jesse Gillis, expert in transcriptome meta-analysis, and Dr. Josh Huang, expert in GABAergic interneuron identity, will be my mentors. Dr. Bing Ren, Dr. Adam Siepel, Dr. Guoping Feng, Dr. Jessica Tollkuhn and Dr. Michael Greenberg will be collaborators and members of my advisory committee, ensuring that my research will be of the highest caliber. My training will also involve coursework in multiomics data integration and comparative genomics, and I will continue my professional development by presenting at international conferences, mentoring students and attending workshops at CSHL. Together, the proposed studies and professional training will ensure my successful transition to an independent position at a major university where I will lead a lab that will advance the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. Interneurons are key components of neural circuitry, acting as the cellular `brakes' that dampen neuronal activity. Although it has long been known that interneurons come in many different shapes and sizes, both the extent of this diversity and its consequences for brain function remain unclear. In this project, we propose that by combining information about the gene activity and epigenetic landscapes of interneurons across multiple species we will generate an integrated, multi-layered portrait of interneuron diversity which we can use to understand brain",Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity,9898481,K99MH120050,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Lateral Geniculate Body', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Portraits', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'data integration', 'design', 'developmental neurobiology', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'methylome', 'mouse genetics', 'neural circuit', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills training', 'student mentoring', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,K99,2020,118421,0.021955772379897712
"Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development Project Summary  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major congenital anomalies. In cases where CDH co-occurs with cardiovascular malformations (CVMs), mortality rates increase from 30 to 60%, and long-term morbidity is common. Our goal is to identify genes that cause CDH and CDH/CVM, and to discover the mechanism by which they control diaphragm and heart development.  Correctly identifying genes that contribute to specific phenotypes from the large list of candidate genes data generated in research and clinical studies is a major obstacle to progress in this and other research fields. In Specific Aim #1, we will address this challenge by generating ranked CDH and CDH/CVM pathogenicity scores for all RefSeq genes using a machine-learning algorithm that integrates data from large-scale genomic knowledge sources. We will use these scores to identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes from cytogenetically defined critical regions and form large next-generation sequencing databases as part of our multifaceted approach to novel gene discovery. We will also accelerate the pace at which human disease genes are discovered by making these scores and our machine-learning algorithm freely available.  8p23.1 microdeletions that encompass GATA4 and SOX7 are among the most frequently identified causes of CDH/CVM. In RNA-seq studies, we identified several CDH-associated genes that are dysregulated in the E15.5 diaphragms of Gata4flox/flox;Prx1-Cre embryos. These embryos are an ideal model of the sac hernias that comprise 20% of human CDH cases. In Specific Aim #2, we will combine data from RNA-seq and BioChIP-seq analyses with the priority scores generated in Aim #1 to identify primary GATA4 target genes whose dysregulation contribute to the development of sac CDH. We will then determine if alterations in the expression of these target genes can cause CDH, or can modify the CDH phenotypes of GATA4-deficient mice.  We have shown that SOX7 deficiency causes septal defects by decreasing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the developing heart. In RNA-seq and in situ hybridization studies we have shown that the expression of Wnt4—a key regulator of EMT in the endocardium—is severely decreased in E9.5 Sox7-/- hearts. In Specific Aim #3 we will determine if Wnt4 is a primary target of SOX7, and whether modulation of WNT4 or its downstream effectors can rescue SOX7-related cardiac phenotypes.  Several lines of evidence suggset that WNT4 is a novel CDH/CVM gene in humans. To confirm this association, and learn more about the role of WNT4 in diaphragm and heart development, we will determine if WNT4 deficiency causes CDH/CVM in mice, if Sox7 and Wnt4 interact genetically in the development of CDH/CVM and if SOX7 regulates Wnt4 transcripition in the developing diaphragm.  Through these studies we will identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes and pathways. The bioinformatic tools we develop in this grant will enhance gene discovery efforts across multiple research fields.

"Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases Project Summary/Abstract Many diseases are understudied because they are rare or of little public interest. The effect of each understudied disease may be limited, but the cumulative effects of all these diseases could be profound. One common research challenge for these diseases is that the resources allocated to each is often limited. For instance, large- scale screening of drugs is often challenging, if not possible, in small labs. The decreasing costs of next generation sequencing make possible the generation of gene expression profiles of understudied disease samples. Integrating these expression profiles with other open data provides tremendous opportunities to gain insights into disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutics for understudied diseases. We have utilized a systems-based approach that employs gene expression profiles of disease samples and drug-induced gene expression profiles from cancer cell lines to predict new therapeutic candidates for hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma and basal cell carcinoma. All these candidates were successfully validated in preclinical models. The success of this approach relies on multiscale procedures, such as quality control of disease samples, selection of appropriate reference tissues, evaluation of disease signatures, and weighting cell lines. There is a plethora of relevant datasets and analysis modules that are publicly available, yet are isolated in distinct silos, making it tedious to implement this approach in translational research. A centralized informatics system that allows prediction of therapeutics for further experimental validation is thus of great interest to researchers working on understudied diseases. Accordingly, we propose four specific aims: 1) developing novel deep learning methods to select precise reference normal tissues for disease signature creation, 2) developing computational methods to reuse drug profiles from other disease models for drug prediction, 3) integrating open efficacy data to identify new targets from the systems-based approach, and 4) developing a centralized platform and promoting the platform in the scientific community. This proposal will reuse several big open databases (e.g., TCGA, TARGET, GTEx, GEO, LINCS, CTRP, GDSC) and employ cutting-edge informatics methods (e.g., deep learning). To demonstrate the scalability of the system, we will investigate three representative understudied diseases: multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (Aim 1), diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (Aim 2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Aim 3). Successful implementation of the systems-based approach can be used as a model for using other large open omics (proteins, metabolites) to discover therapeutics for diseases with unmet needs. This proposal will bring together experts in informatics, statistics, computer science, and physicians from Michigan State University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Spectrum Health. All data and code will be released to the public for continuing development. The system will be deployed to our OCTAD portal (http://octad.org), an open workplace for therapeutic discovery. Project Narrative About 25 million people are living with understudied diseases in the U.S. Although there are voluminous high dimensional molecular datasets that could be leveraged for research, individual labs have limited computational capacity to translate these molecular features into therapeutic hits. We propose to build a centralized information system that allows individual labs to easily harness open gene expression datasets and generate new therapeutic targets or drug candidates for further experimental validation.",Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases,9998976,R01GM134307,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Asia', 'Basal Cell', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Cancer cell line', 'Case Study', 'Cell Line', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evaluation', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Quality Control', 'Ramp', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'System', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Workplace', 'base', 'cancer gene expression', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'disorder control', 'drug candidate', 'drug mechanism', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open data', 'overexpression', 'pill', 'protein metabolite', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,413916,0.031352810316318695
"New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Cellular state transitions (i.e. from pluripotent to committed, replicative to quiescent, etc.) require the  coordinated regulation of thousands of genes. Therapeutically harnessing these transitions holds great  promise for human health;; for instance, autologous stem cell therapy has been successfully used in  regenerative medicine and cancer treatments, among others. While some of the key regulatory switches are  known, the field lacks a systems-­level understanding of the genomic circuits that control these transitions,  information that is critical for informed clinical intervention. Here, we will develop an integrated computational  framework to identify core gene regulatory circuits from large gene networks and predict their dynamics and  regulatory functions without the need of detailed network kinetic parameters. Advances in genomics profiling  technology have enabled the mapping of gene regulatory networks, thus we now have the capacity to identify  combinatorial interactions among genes and the master regulators of state transitions. Some systems biology  approaches have simulated the dynamics of a gene regulatory circuit, but traditional methods suffer from two  key issues. First, there is no rational rule to choose an appropriate set of regulator genes in a large network to  model. Second, since it is hard to directly measure most network kinetic parameters from experiment,  modeling results are based on a set of guessed parameters that can be less than optimal, limiting the  application of mathematical modeling to large systems and the prediction power of systems biology. To  address these issues, we recently developed algorithm named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE). RACIPE  generates an ensemble of circuit models, each of which corresponds to a distinct set of random kinetic  parameters, and uniquely identifies robust features, such as clusters of stable gene expression states, by  statistical analysis. We will further enhance RACIPE algorithms for large systems and new data analysis tools  using machine learning. This approach will convert a traditional nonlinear dynamics problem into a data  analysis problem, an essential step for extending the application of gene circuit modeling to large systems. It  also provides a novel strategy to integrate top-­down genomics approaches with bottom-­up mathematical  modeling. The algorithms will be tested and refined using literature-­based gene networks, public genomics  data, and data from collaboration, with a focus on cell differentiation in developmental processes and state  transitions in oncogenesis. Success of the project will result in a comprehensive toolkit that will unveil the gene  regulatory mechanism of cellular decision-­making in any cell of interest. The algorithmic development is   expected to have a broad impact on not only basic research in systems biology but also shed light on  therapeutic intervention in genomic medicine.      RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  Most human complex diseases are multigenic, but our understanding of the interactions between genes in  healthy states and how they are disrupted in disease states is lacking. Computational algorithms will be  designed to construct and model gene regulatory circuits of higher complexity to fill an important gap in our  understanding of the maintenance and transitions among cellular states and their abnormal behavior in  disease. In this proposal, we will develop a suite of systems-­biology tools to extend gene circuit modeling to  large systems and integrate genomics data relevant to fundamental cell biology, cancer, and other human  diseases.   ",New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits,10246751,R35GM128717,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autologous', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Public Health', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human disease', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'novel strategies', 'stem cell therapy', 'success', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,392500,0.03176954487631447
"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,9898392,R35GM131845,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Caenorhabditis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth', 'Hermaphroditism', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Meiosis', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Switch Genes', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'X Inactivation', 'autosome', 'chromatin modification', 'condensin', 'dosage', 'histone demethylase', 'male', 'man', 'neural network', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'sex', 'sex determination', 'single molecule', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2020,466290,0.01653301987307897
"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular physiology and is likely to reveal a subset of proteins that should be advanced as targets for new therapeutic drugs.",Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome,10015261,U24DK116204,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'data interoperability', 'data resource', 'data reuse', 'data tools', 'design', 'human disease', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knockout gene', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phosphoproteomics', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stable isotope', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2020,2259159,0.022583388024991293
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9979887,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,400001,0.028249109242110878
"Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections Thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections (TAAD) are a cause of premature deaths, responsible for up to 8% of sudden deaths in industrialized countries. Identifying individuals at risk for TAAD allows for medical management that prevents deaths due to dissections. We determined that up to 20% of TAAD patients without a known genetic syndrome have a family history of TAAD, which is inherited primarily in an autosomal dominant manner (termed heritable thoracic aortic disease, HTAD). We established a cohort of HTAD families (842 families with two or more members with TAAD) and used this cohort to identify novel HTAD genes. Positional cloning and candidate gene approaches by our lab and others have successfully identified 18 genes for HTAD. We hypothesize that there are multiple altered genes yet to be identified, disrupting known and novel molecular pathways responsible for thoracic aortic disease, and responsible for disease in the unsolved HTAD families. The overarching goal of the project is to identify the remaining genes for HTAD, characterize the phenotype associated with these novel genes, perform initial molecular studies linking the mutant gene to aortic disease, and rapidly translate these findings into improved clinical care and prevention of premature deaths due to aortic dissection in HTAD families. The proposed aims are: (1) Recruit and characterize additional HTAD families to be used to identify novel genes, and delineate the clinical features and mutation spectrum associated with new genes; (2) Pursue exome/genome sequencing on HTAD cases and use the genetic strategies to identify novel genes, including segregation of rare variants in affected relatives and trios (affected proband and unaffected parents) and burden analyses; (3) Pursue a machine-learning approach using exome data from HTAD families and controls to identify novel disease genes; (4) Perform initial molecular and cellular biology studies of novel HTAD genes to confirm a link between the mutant gene and thoracic aortic disease. In summary, we are uniquely poised to identify novel HTAD genes using our assembled cohort and are proposing both proven and novel strategies to identify additional HTAD genes. Uncovering HTAD genes is crucial for identifying individuals at risk for aortic dissections and initiating gene-specific clinical management to prevent premature death due to dissections.

"Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development Rotator cuff tears affect over 15% of Americans and impair shoulder joint biomechanics and function. Following repair of symptomatic tears, functional deficits frequently persist and re-tears are common, due to the complex anatomy and high functional demands on the rotator cuff tendons. Rotator cuff tendon tissue engineering research is focused on devices to improve immediate mechanical support to the repair and to stimulate early and rapid tendon regeneration rather than scarring and fibrosis, particularly for the supraspinatus tendon (SST), the most commonly torn tendon in the rotator cuff. Aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic both the highly aligned medial region of the SST, and bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the multi-axially aligned isotropic anterior region of the SST have been evaluated with promising results when seeded with adipose- derived stem cells (ASCs). However, progress in this area of rotator cuff tendon engineering and in other areas of tendon research is hindered by the lack of definitive markers for SST or for its regional heterogeneity, the lack of understanding to what extent ASCs are tenogenic and can assume the identity of tendon fibroblasts, the lack of specific markers for tendon fibroblast identity and tenogenic differentiation, and by a lack of markers for tendon maturation and response to mechanical loading in engineered tendon. Therefore, is it difficult to assess how successful current tendon tissue engineering approaches really are, or to predict how well tendon tissue engineered approaches will function in translation when autologous or allogeneic ASCs from diverse human populations are used to enhance rotator cuff repair via augmentation or interposition with engineered tendon devices. These studies will evaluate the epigenome (methylome), transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, metabolome and phenome (phenotype) of native human SST and donor-matched tissue engineered tendon produced from SST fibroblasts and ASCs. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate the data to an integrated multiome, which will then be used with machine learning approaches to extract key causal ‘driver’ genes, or tendon specific genes or molecules responsible for: 1) SST heterogeneity between medial and anterior regions. 2) Tendon cell identity and the extent of tenogenesis by ASCs on electrospun scaffolds. 3) The heterogenetic response by ASCs on uni- vs. bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the native heterogeneity of the SST. 4) The response of engineered tendon to dynamic loading. Identified driver genes or molecules will be validated though over-expression or silencing approaches, thus providing therapeutic targets for manipulation to enhance tenogenesis, and engineered tendon development and maturation. Together these innovative studies will provide a template for improved external validity of benchtop tendon tissue engineering and pre-clinical studies towards successful translation in diverse patient populations. In addition, the bioinformatics and multiomics toolboxes and assays that result from this work will be invaluable to not only the tendon research community, but also to the wider musculoskeletal and regenerative medicine fields. A small number of driver genes in other medical fields are responsible for changes in expression and protein levels in hundreds of other genes, and subsequent tissue metabolism. The process of tissue engineered rotator cuff tendon development and formation as it relates to adult tendon after surgical repair is not well understood, despite rotator cuff tears being an important clinical problem and representing almost one third of orthopedic injuries. Evaluating changes in the ability of genes to be translated to proteins at the DNA, RNA, small metabolite, and protein level of tissue engineered tendon formation under different loading conditions compared to normal adult tendon will identify driver genes and potential new ways to improve currently available options for rotator cuff repair.",Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development,9894766,R01AR073882,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cadaver', 'Cells', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Harvest', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joint structure of shoulder region', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stimulation', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Seeds', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'design', 'epigenome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multiple omics', 'overexpression', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preclinical study', 'progenitor', 'regenerative', 'repaired', 'response', 'rotator cuff tear', 'scaffold', 'spatial relationship', 'stem cells', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'tendon development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'translation to humans']",NIAMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,491199,0.03135097153269058
"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,9937764,U24HG003345,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ensure', 'Equus caballus', 'Family', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Glutathione S-Transferase', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pan Genus', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudogenes', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Study models', 'Syntenic Conservation', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'Zebrafish', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'gene product', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'interest', 'member', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'olfactory receptor', 'parallelization', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vertebrate genome', 'web site']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2020,550000,0.07298378799220735
"Integrative Multi-Scale Systems Analysis of Gene-Expression-Driven Aging Morbidity Project Summary In a well-received preprint, the investigator identified through unbiased analysis of own and published datasets that during aging, and infection of the lung with influenza A, there is a progressive imbalance in the transcript levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes. Failure of gene expression homeostasis impacts the rheostatic ability of almost all cellular processes implicated in aging impairing organ function, particularly in response to systemic stress. Transcriptome imbalance could account for manifestations of aging through several potential mechanisms, including: 1) The dysregulation of individual genes, 2) A dysregulation of the stoichiometry of macromolecular complexes, 3) A relative upregulation of short early-response inflammatory genes, 4) A breakdown of the coordination between molecular pathways and processes encoded by genes of different lengths and 5) A reduction in the capacity of protein homeostasis and cell stress responses to respond towards external stimuli by sequestering its activity toward a buffering of transcriptome imbalance. The investigator will test the hypothesis that during aging transcriptome imbalance globally interferes with the functions encoded by the genome and contributes to the loss of resilience in older individuals. To address this fundamental question, he will focus on innovative mammalian ex vivo, in vitro, and in vivo models of age-dependent transcriptome imbalance, and machine-learning approaches. Reflecting the interdisciplinary character, he will work under the supervision of his main mentor Dr. Amaral, a network scientist and data- scientist, and his co-mentor Dr. Morimoto, a molecular biologist studying protein homeostasis and aging. Further marking his transition to independence, he will be mentored by Dr. Budinger, an immunologist studying changes in immune aging, and Dr. McNally, a geneticist and bioinformatician, which is not part of a project grant of his mentors. Aim 1 (K99): To determine whether SFPQ regulates transcriptome imbalance in aging. Aim 2 (K99): To determine whether adaptive changes in proteostasis buffer transcriptome imbalance during aging after influenza A pneumonia. Aim 3 (R00): To causally link transcriptome imbalance to the age-related susceptibility to influenza A pneumonia. Importantly, the investigator’s mentoring committee has a very strong track record of training postdoctoral fellows in transitioning into independent investigators. He will engage in seminars and learn recent experimental techniques, grant writing, bioethics training, and training on running a laboratory, and obtain additional off-site training on the biology of aging in mice with the purpose to facilitate collaborations. Combining the new skills learned during his K99 mentored phase with his prior expertise in data science and transcriptomics will ensure a strong technical foundation to launch an independent laboratory on gene expression homeostasis in aging and the mechanisms underlying multi-system dysfunction. Project Narrative The ability to sustain gene expression homeostasis, is one of the most integral parts of cellular biology but declines with age. In a well-received preprint, the project investigator discovered that most organs of 24 months old mice, and lungs infected with influenza A, display a genome-wide imbalance in the transcript levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes. This project will address the regulation of this transcriptome imbalance and its impact on the functional health of the proteome and the multi-morbidity in aged individuals.",Integrative Multi-Scale Systems Analysis of Gene-Expression-Driven Aging Morbidity,10040210,K99AG068544,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Bioethics', 'Biology of Aging', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Stress', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Geroscience', 'Global Change', 'Glutamine', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune', 'Immunologist', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung infections', 'Machine Learning', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Polymerase', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA metabolism', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcript', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'Writing', 'age related', 'aged', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell age', 'genome-wide', 'healthspan', 'immune function', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'influenza A pneumonia', 'innovation', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'pneumonia model', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'proteostasis', 'resilience', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'stoichiometry', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,122861,0.04118742326562314
"Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology There is now incontrovertible evidence from sophisticated lineage tracing studies that vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) de-differentiation contributes substantively to a number of vascular diseases. A major manifesta- tion of such phenotypic change is attenuated expression of a battery of VSMC-restricted genes, including the enigmatic smooth muscle calponin (Cnn1) gene. The function of Cnn1 has been studied primarily in vitro or in a single knockout mouse wherein several exons and introns were replaced with a neo cassette which, as detailed below, obfuscates accurate interpretation of phenotypes. We have championed the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system in mice to engineer subtle substitutions within regulatory elements of many genes, leaving intact all coding sequences. We report here a remarkable phenotype wherein a single base change of a single CArG box in the Cnn1 locus abolishes expression of CNN1 in vascular (but not visceral) SMC. Full expression of CNN1 is restored with a BAC carrying human CNN1 or CRISPR-mediated activation of the en- dogenous Cnn1 promoter. Cnn1 CArG mutant mice, representing the first animal models of regulatory element edits, also show elevation in VSMC DNA synthesis and defective contractile competence. Conversely, over- expression of BAC-CNN1 suppresses VSMC growth, antagonizes neointimal formation, reduces VSMC lipid uptake, and enhances contractile gene expression. Interestingly, CNN1-Ser175 appears to be a critical residue for some of these effects making it an attractive amino acid for CRISPR-mediated editing in mice. Additional data support CNN1 as a scaffold for ERK signaling and effector of the immotile state of differentiated VSMC. Importantly, a complete understanding of CNN1 function is complicated by robust expression of two related genes (Cnn2 and Cnn3) in VSMC. We hypothesize that CNN1 functions in concert with other CNN isoforms to maintain a mature VSMC differentiated state. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims using state-of-the-art tools in genetics, animal models of disease, and molecular physiology assays of VSMC function. Aim 1 will exploit the single base edit in Cnn1 as a novel loss-of-function mouse in context of acute and chronic vascular disease models; complementation studies will be carried out in vitro and in vivo to rigorously ascribe pheno- typic changes to the specific loss of CNN1. Aim 2 will exploit a well-characterized BAC mouse to elucidate functions associated with Cnn1 gain-of-function in models of vascular disease used in Aim 1. Complementary CRISPR editing of the BAC mouse, in background of Cnn1 KO, will afford exquisite insight into functional residues that mediate CNN1 function. Aim 3 will exploit new floxed Cnn2 and Cnn3 mice with an exciting VSMC-specific Cre driver we have developed to address, for the first time, triple Cnn KO mouse models at baseline and in acute or chronic vascular disease models. These studies, based on paradigm-shifting approaches to gene KOs, serve as a template for the study of other gene families linked to VSMC differen- tiation and will inform future studies targeting CNN1 in diseases where VSMC differentiation is compromised. Diseases of blood vessels involve radical changes in the normal program of gene expression and function, the underlying nature of which is poorly understood. We have used the revolutionary CRISPR system of genome editing to study a gene called CNN1, which is specific for smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. We will study this gene, along with related genes, in both cells and blood vessels to gain new insights into vascular diseases.",Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology,10053587,R01HL136224,"['Actins', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Aneurysm', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Injury', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Cre driver', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth', 'Hematological Disease', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Introns', 'Ion Channel', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'LoxP-flanked allele', 'MAPK3 gene', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Serum Response Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'base', 'calponin', 'cell growth', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'gene function', 'genome editing', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'insight', 'knockout gene', 'loss of function', 'migration', 'mouse genetics', 'mouse model', 'myocardin', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'response', 'scaffold', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vascular injury', 'vascular smooth muscle cell migration']",NHLBI,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,571166,0.039482335706391924
"Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline Project Summary Despite extraordinary advances in genome engineering, tools for precise and efficient gene correction and delivery across all cell types remain lacking. Current programmable DNA cleavage tools, such as meganucleases, Zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR- Cas9, rely on recruiting the DNA repair machinery, either using error-prone, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair for gene knockout, or homology directed repair (HDR) for precise correction. However, HDR is inactive in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons, and is often inefficient, achieving 50% correction at most. Genome editing still lacks efficient, robust tools that can insert, delete, and recombine large stretches of DNA sequence. Moreover, delivery tools are a significant barrier to deploying tissue-specific genomic engineering technologies as current vehicles, including widely-used viral vectors and liposomal approaches, have limited capacity, offer variable efficiency, and lack precise tissue tropism. The proposed work involves computationally mining bacteria for new classes of gene editing enzymes and delivery vectors. We know that natural recombinases and transposases can mediate programmed DNA rearrangement and insertion, and these classes of enzymes are present in phage defense and mobile islands in bacteria, which largely remain uncharacterized. Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that retroviral/retrotransposon gag-like proteins can self-assemble and encapsulate nucleic acid in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and viral-like particles (VLPs) for cell-to-cell communication. As with defense islands, these proteins can also be systematically catalogued via a bioinformatic pipeline and experimentally characterized. The proposed work will focus on three main goals: 1) signatures for phage defense, mobile genetic activity, or VLP-forming activity will be mined to build a machine learning pipeline for comprehensively discovering novel gene clusters from novel metagenomic sequences with a focus for proteins that can manipulate nucleic acid or self-assemble, 2) candidate gene clusters will be cloned from metagenomic samples and undergo high-throughput screening using biochemical and bacterial assays for gene editing and capsid formation, as well as engineering to hone activity, and 3) the most promising candidates will be evaluated for activity in mammalian systems with assays for highly efficient gene insertion and VLP formation. The work will elucidate novel bacterial phage defense and VLP biology, and result in the development of new technologies for more efficient genetic manipulation and gene delivery. Moreover, this gene exploration and engineering framework will serve as a model for discovering diverse bacterial gene clusters and defense systems, evaluating biochemical activity across a range of assays, and converting these findings into high impact biotechnologies. The developed technologies will accelerate the pace of biomedical research and enable greater exploration of basic biological processes and disease mechanisms. Project Narrative There are more than 5,000 human diseases caused by known genetic variation, including mutations, insertions, and deletions, but programmable tools and delivery vectors to reliably study and model these diseases are lacking. We propose a two-pronged approach to discovering novel gene editing and delivery strategies by (1) mining bacterial and archaeal systems to identify novel defense systems and enzymes that have activities useful for genome editing and (2) identifying gene clusters linked to extracellular vesicle or viral-like particle formation that will allow development of better gene delivery systems. The technologies developed from this work will accelerate the study and modeling of disease biology and provide a framework for general prokaryotic gene discovery across many biotechnological areas.","Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline",9873379,R21AI149694,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacterial Model', 'Bacteriophages', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Capsid', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Elements', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Transfer', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Island', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liposomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Mining', 'Mitotic', 'Mobile Genetic Elements', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Nonhomologous DNA End Joining', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phylogeny', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stretching', 'Study models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Transposase', 'Viral', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'cell regeneration', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental adaptation', 'enzyme activity', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene delivery system', 'gene discovery', 'gene repair', 'genetic manipulation', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knockout gene', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein profiling', 'recombinase', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'restraint', 'screening', 'technology development', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'vector genome', 'zinc finger nuclease']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,188250,0.025162992505519927
"Macrophage Polarization in Response to Infections and Inflammation Abstract Macrophages in Greek means “big eaters"" are powerful cellular components of innate immunity. They play a pivotal role in immune defense by ‘eating’ pathogens, dead or cancerous cells. They also contribute to tissue homeostasis, development and repair. When doing their job, macrophages react to their surroundings and trigger acute inflammation to resolve the problems. They do so by assuming one of the two states that have been widely recognized, i.e., immunoreactive (proinflammatory) and immunotolerant (a.k.a, M1 and M2, respectively). While finite degrees of reactivity and tolerance are desirable in physiology, excess of either state is undesirable and invariably associated with disease pathogenesis (i.e., the Goldilocks conundrum). For example, hyperreactivity is recognized as the root cause of tissue injury in a wide array of diseases (colitis, sepsis, NASH) and hypertolerance is a common determinant that drives most, if not all chronic diseases that are incurable, e.g., cancers. Consensus on the definition of these physiologic and pathologic macrophage states has not been reached, perhaps because of 4 major challenges: heterogeneity, biological robustness, the temporal evolution of the network, and artifacts (tremendous plasticity of macrophages as they drift rapidly when isolated from tissues). We have used a novel computational methodology, Boolean Implication Network [Sahoo 2008], to analyze pooled human macrophage gene expression datasets. This method, which identifies asymmetric gene expression patterns, blurs noise (heterogeneity/artifacts) but reveals a temporal model of events that is invariably seen across all datasets. The analysis revealed hitherto unknown continuum transition states between reactive to tolerant states along five paths; machine-learning identified one of them as the major path which subsequently stood the rigorous test/validation on multiple publicly available transcriptomic datasets, across species (mouse and human), macrophage subtypes and disease states. Most importantly, unlike other commonly used gene cluster signatures, the Boolean path can prognosticate outcomes across diverse diseases. Preliminary validation studies on a genetic model confirm that the path could be exploited for modulating macrophage polarization by altering LPS/TLR4 responses. We will now interrogate the impact of these discoveries using an iterative approach, i.e., model-driven experimentation and experiment-driven model refinement, through three aims: Unravel the importance of novel molecular drivers in the newly identified gene signatures of macrophage polarization using semi-HTP chemical/genetic screens on murine and human monocyte-derived macrophages (Aim 1), in murine disease models of hyperreactivity and hypertolerance (Aim 2) and in “Humanoids”, i.e., human organoid-based microbe/immune cells co-culture models (“gut-in-a-dish”; Aim 3). Although our focus is gastrointestinal infection and inflammation, the findings will define macrophage transition states in multiple organs/disease contexts and therefore, impact many fields. We expect to identify high-value therapeutic targets that can restrict and/or reset macrophage responses to infections and inflammation within the “Goldilocks zone.” Narrative Macrophages are powerful cellular components of innate immunity; on the one hand they play a pivotal role in defending against pathogens, cancerous cells and other harmful stimuli by being immunoreactive, and on the other hand, they contribute to tissue homeostasis by being immunotolerant to harmless antigens and beneficial microbes. Too much or too little of either of these two states (immunoreactive vs. tolerant) can serve as triggers and perpetuate diverse human diseases. Using novel computational approaches, we have charted a formal model for macrophage response to infections, and revealed hitherto unknown important genes that regulate the process of macrophage polarization; we plan to identify potential therapeutic targets that can reprogram macrophage response in disease states.",Macrophage Polarization in Response to Infections and Inflammation,10100201,R01AI155696,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Antigens', 'Arthritis', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cancerous', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Eating', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Immunity', 'Noise', 'Nomenclature', 'Occupations', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TLR4 gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'beneficial microorganism', 'body system', 'bone', 'cell type', 'chemical genetics', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gastrointestinal infection', 'genetic signature', 'human disease', 'human model', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'validation studies']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,1000214,0.023910618621081032
"Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to build mathematical models of human innate immune responses to the global pathogen influenza virus A (IAV). To ensure successful replication, viral pathogens must simultaneously hijack several components of the host cell machinery while either evading or disabling innate cellular defenses. The host genetic background and subsequent viral and host signaling interactions dictate disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to mortality. Recent studies of IAV in genetically diverse murine models confirm the critical role of genotype in host response and outcome. Both molecular targets as well as key proteins involved in IAV pathogenesis could be therapeutically exploited to attenuate or prevent disease. Thus, we construct models of the molecular networks driving early innate IAV response that can be used to model genetic effects. Our experimental system is human lung epithelium, the first-line of defense against and target of IAV.  Aim 1. Genetic predictions from the gene regulatory network (GRN) governing human epithelial IAV response. GRNs describe the control of gene expression by transcription factors (TFs). We showed that integrating ATAC-seq with RNA-seq improves GRN accuracy. To construct a dynamic GRN in our heterogeneous lung tissue model, we propose scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements of IAV infection and IFNβ stimulation time courses. Our group recently discovered new mechanisms by which the IAV protein Ns1 drives promoter-independent transcriptional “read-through” and alters 3D-chromatin architecture. Thus, for modeling, we also measure genomic transcription initiation and promoter-capture Hi-C. Following experimental testing and GRN refinement, we will use a deep-learning model trained on DNA sequence and epigenetic data to provide inputs that enable dynamic GRN simulations for thousands of human genotypes. We will identify genetic risk loci and molecular mechanisms driving difference in gene expression responses across individuals.  Aim 2. Model the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and cellular signaling networks driving the innate immune response to IAV. We developed mutant influenza viruses, each encoding a FLAG-tagged viral protein, while maintaining virulence in vivo. We will use the mutant IAV to map host-virus PPIs in human lung epithelial cells and mouse lung in vivo. Integrating with diverse ‘omics datasets, we will construct a molecular network model connecting virus-host PPIs through cellular signaling pathways to IAV-dependent TFs. We will test pathway reconstruction with epistasis mapping.  Completion of both aims will lead to a GRN spanning virus-host PPIs and cellular signaling to TF control of gene expression in an innate-immune cell type. Our experimental-computational design is widely applicable. This model, and its future adaptation to other cells, will help identify the genetic and molecular mechanisms driving diverse human IAV responses and the network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Human response to Influenza virus infection varies dramatically between individuals, from mildly symptomatic to death. We will systematically measure and model the innate immune response to IAV at the molecular network level: from host-virus protein-protein interactions through cellular signal transduction to changes in gene expression in human cells. The resulting mathematical model will help identify network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy and help predict differences in IAV response in the human population.",Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus,9950738,U01AI150748,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromatin', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza A virus', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferon-beta', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Population', 'Prize', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tracheal Epithelium', 'Training', 'Transcription Elongation', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'adaptive immune response', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu', 'forest', 'global health', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human model', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenzavirus', 'mathematical model', 'molecular modeling', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'risk variant', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF', 'transcription termination', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,1202266,0.009471440989317768
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9938688,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2020,480000,0.07102316593506311
"Hematopoietic Stem Cell And Cord Blood Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hematopoietic cell transplantation from unrelated donors, haploidentical related donors and cord blood units can cure life-threatening blood disorders; however, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse and survivorship disparities across different ancestries remain the major obstacles. When matched donors are not available, the properties of HLA mismatches that govern (non)-permissivity are not well-defined. Furthermore, the role of KIR/HLA interactions in modulating relapse remain to be clarified. These deficiencies have important implications for a large fraction of patients who lack HLA-matched donors, and for all patients at risk for disease relapse. We have demonstrated that HLA class I leader peptides, HLA-DP expression, and HLA/KIR interactions each contribute to GVHD, relapse and mortality. The unmet needs are to understand the mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes modulate transplant risks, and a means to apply the research findings to clinical care. We propose to define the underlying mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes and proteins function in transplantation, and develop tools for using HLA and KIR in the selection of the optimal transplant donor and cord blood unit. The specific aims are to: define the role of HLA-DP expression and peptide-binding groove pocket in GVHD; define NKG2/HLA-E interactions and HLA-G in GVHD and relapse; define the role for KIR and HLA interaction in relapse after HCT for acute leukemia, and design tools to evaluate gene features in clinical practice. The goals will be achieved through systemic analysis of individual gene variation, haplotypes of genes, and receptor/ligand recognition in large ethnically diverse transplant populations with complete clinical data. This proposal will fill the knowledge gap in the immunobiological basis of GVHD, relapse and survivorship disparities in transplantation. The information will increase the safety, efficacy and availability of transplantation for all patients in need of this life-saving therapy. Project Narrative We will study how immune system genes affect the success of transplantation for patients of diverse ancestries. This information will help to lower risks through individualized treatment options for future patients.",Hematopoietic Stem Cell And Cord Blood Transplantation,10007670,U01AI069197,"['Acute Graft Versus Host Disease', 'Acute leukemia', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'African', 'Alleles', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asians', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Caucasians', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Donor person', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GEM gene', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HLA G antigen', 'HLA-A gene', 'HLA-B Antigens', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'HLA-DP Antigens', 'HLA-DPB1 gene', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hispanics', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peptide Leader Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Property', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Selection Criteria', 'Sentinel', 'Shapes', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'ethnic diversity', 'gene function', 'graft vs host disease', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'leukemia', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'prognostic', 'protein function', 'receptor', 'success', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'tumor', 'working group']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,U01,2020,200000,0.02706969243193438
"Development of methods for transcript quantification and differential expression analysis using long-read sequencing technologies. The rapid development of Third Generation, Long Read Sequencing (LRS) platforms such as Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have enabled increasing precision and higher-throughput sequencing of transcripts. Long reads can produce full-length transcript sequences, overcoming much of the uncertainty of short-read methods to accurately define transcripts, particularity for those genes with alternative splicing (more than 90% of human genes), for which short read sequencing has thus far proved difficult. LRS is therefore the natural choice for the study of the expression of transcript variants and of the role of alternative isoforms in disease and development. While the first iterations of the long-read technologies did not produce enough reads to quantify more than the highest expressed transcripts, the current sequencing depth of up to 8 million reads per SMRT cells on the Sequel 2 platforms promises reliable quantifiability for more modestly expressed genes. Also significant yield increases have been reported for Nanopore. This suggests that LRS may have reached sufficient throughput to enable accurate quantification of gene expression and differential expression analyses. LRS transcriptomics data have, however, specific properties that are absent in other transcriptomics technologies, such are partial matches of reference transcript models. Therefore specific methods for quantification and statistical analysis need to be developed. In this Project, we aim to characterize in detail the data distribution in long reads data, propose strategies to deal with their particular read uncertainty issues and develop new strategies for differential expression analysis. The overarching goal is to create the analytical framework to fully leverage LRS technologies for the study of isoform dynamics in relation of biomedical relevant questions. The goal of this project is to develop the SQANTI-QDE software, the first integral framework for the management of long read sequencing Iso-seq experiments. SQANTI-QDE will provide, in one tool, functionalities for the annotation and processing of multiple samples, improved definition of bona-fide transcripts, quantification of transcript expression, flexible creation of count matrices, data normalization, and differential expression and isoform usage analysis.

"Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers as development of psychiatric disorders supplement Project Summary/Abstract The mandate of the PsychENCODE Data Analysis Core (DAC) includes the development of novel integrative methodologies to construct a coherent interpretational framework for the data emerging from the consortium. The complexity of building such a framework lies in the diversity of experimental assays and their associated confounding factors, as well as in the inherent uncertainty regarding how the various target biological components function together. As a result, any analytical and computational methods would need to capture this high dimensionality of structure in the data. While classical, parallel computation advances at an incredible pace and continues to serve the needs of the research community, our experience with the ever- increasing complexity of neuropsychiatric datasets has motivated us to also look at other promising technological avenues. Accordingly, motivated by recent developments in the field of quantum computing (QC), we herein explore the use of QC algorithms as applied to two problems of relevance to the PsychENCODE DAC: (1) the prediction of brain-specific enhancers based on variants and functional genomic assays (Aim S1; related to Aim 1 of the parent grant); and (2) the calculation of the contributions of cell types to tissue-level gene expression and to the occurrence of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder (Aim S2; related to Aim 1 of the parent grant). The nascency of QC hardware technologies and the complexity of simulating quantum algorithms on classical computing resources means that our exploration will be confined to smaller, judiciously chosen datasets.Nevertheless, the work in this supplement will serve to evaluate future prospects for the use of QC algorithms and hardware in genomic analyses. We also consider two different paradigms of QC, the quantum annealer and the quantum gate model, and weigh their efficiency relative to classical computing. Finally, we will incorporate the QC and classical predictions into PsychENCODE consortium's database and online portal for visualizing the relationships between different genetic and genomic elements, and evaluate corroborating evidence for the predictions (Aim S3; related to Aim 2 of the parent grant). Project Narrative The PsychENCODE consortium has conducted extensive functional genomic analyses of samples from individuals diagnosed with psychiatric disorders aim to discover the complex biological architecture that lead from genetic and epigenetic markers of disease to the observed phenotypes. To reveal this underlying structure, the consortium relies on the use of sophisticated computational methods, including machine learning techniques, implemented on cutting-edge massively parallel computing resources by the consrtium’s Data Analysis Core (DAC). However, the scale and complexity of the tasks place significant burdens on these resources, and suggest the need for exploring alternative computing hardware technologies. This supplement to the DAC parent grant evaluates the promise of the emerging field of quantum computing to speed up large-scale computations and more efficiently explore the model landscape, using a comparative analysis of classical and quantum computing algorithms applied to problems relevant to the PsychENCODE DAC: the annotation of brain-specific enhancers and the quantification of cell-type contributions to bulk tissue gene expression.",Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers as development of psychiatric disorders supplement,10047746,U01MH116492,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computing resources', 'data framework', 'design', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'high dimensionality', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'parallel computer', 'parent grant', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'quantum computing', 'simulation', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2020,195697,0.0038708166266514838

"Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches Aortic valve stenosis is the major cause of valve disease in the Western world, and the third leading cause of adult heart disease. It is a progressive disorder that worsens with age. Thickening of the aortic valve is followed by calcification that results in further stenosis that ultimately necessitates surgical replacement. A major risk factor for calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), which is present in 1–2% of the population, and involves formation of a two- rather than three-valve leaflet. ~35% of individuals with BAV will develop CAVD with age, but some with BAV have thickening even in childhood, requiring intervention. There are no medical treatments available for CAVD patients, and the only clinical option is surgical valve replacement. We reported that heterozygous nonsense mutations in the NOTCH1 (N1) transcription factor cause congenital biscuspid aortic valve (BAV) and severe CAVD and evidence suggests N1 is haploinsufficient in valve endothelial cells (ECs). Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs from several patients with CAVD and N1 haploinsufficiency showed increased expression of pro-osteogenic and inflammatory signaling. Network analysis revealed key nodes that were responsible for much of the gene dysregulation. A chemical screen for the ability to restore expression of 120 dysregulated genes by targeted RNA-sequencing revealed several drugs that restored the network close to the N1+/+ state in human iPSC-ECs, with one, XCT790, showing efficacy in vivo for aortic valve thickening, calcification and stenosis in a mouse model. XCT790 is annotated to function as an inhibitor of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα). We now propose to test the hypotheses that XCT790 prevents aortic valve disease by inhibiting ERRα activity, can treat established disease, and can function in a subset of CAVD patient cells without N1 mutations. The aims are 1) to determine the mechanism of action by which XCT790 corrects disease-associated gene expression and prevents aortic valve disease; 2) to determine if XCT790 can treat established CAVD or prevent neonatal valve stenosis; and 3) to determine if gene dysregulation in primary aortic valve endothelial cells from sporadic CAVD patients with or without genetic variants in NOTCH1 pathway genes is responsive to XCT790. These studies will advance a potential therapeutic to treat a disease that represents an enormous unmet medical need, is characterized by high mortality and morbidity, and for which the only current remedy is a highly invasive surgery. Aortic valve disease is the third most common form of heart disease and one of the most difficult to treat pediatric diseases. In adults, calcification and thickening lead to need for surgical replacement, with no medical therapy available. In this proposal we test the mechanism by which a novel small molecule therapeutic prevents aortic valve calcification in mice, test the clinical scenarios in which it may be efficacious and determine the range of patients who may benefit from this therapy by examining the response of cells derived from individuals with valve disease.",Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches,9867301,R01HL150100,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'ERR1 protein', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Estrogen Antagonists', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NOTCH1 gene', 'Neonatal', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Pulmonary Valve Stenosis', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Surgical Valves', 'Telomerase RNA Component', 'Telomere Shortening', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Western World', 'aging population', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve disorder', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'calcification', 'cell type', 'drug testing', 'endothelial stem cell ', 'exome sequencing', 'gene correction', 'genetic variant', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'malformation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'osteogenic', 'prevent', 'response', 'shear stress', 'small molecule libraries', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'telomere', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'valve replacement']",NHLBI,J.

"Predictable control of gene regulation through epigenetic engineering PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Recent landmark discoveries have revealed that in addition to DNA lesions, epigenetic mechanisms also play a major role in cancer. Epigenetics is mediated in part by interactions of proteins and DNA that confer heritable gene expression states. Drugging the cancer epigenome is a burgeoning medical technology that currently uses small molecule inhibitors and small RNAs to disrupt hyperactive epigenetic enzymes. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that a new modality, fusion proteins that interact with the chromatin fiber, will activate therapeutic genes at sites that bear a specific pattern of cancer-related biochemical marks. The specific aims are to (2) use bioinformatic analyses to discover chromosome features that support inducible changes in gene expression states and (2) to use protein engineering to identify determinants of nuclear protein engagement.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods to reactivate dormant therapeutic genes in cancer cells are limited to inhibitors that bind epigenetic enzymes and other proteins.

"Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals ABSTRACT While multidrug-resistance transporters including P-gp and MRP2 are generally studied for their role in exporting drugs and foreign compounds from the cell, our studies indicate that these efflux pumps expressed at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells provide a critical link in communication between sentinel functions of mucosal barriers and the immune system. Understanding how this P-gp/eCB anti-inflammatory arm is regulated will provide crucial insight into how dysfunction may promote intestinal inflammation and help identify potential new therapeutic targets. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the central hypothesis we aim to test is whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to prevent unnecessary inflammation. Our pilot studies indicate that the microbiota does influence P-gp expression and function, providing a unique foundation for further cause-effect studies. No data have previously demonstrated a link between the microbiota and eCBs or any other epithelial lipid signals, and may well provide great insight into a novel system. Bridging this gap could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To begin addressing these questions, in Aim 1 of this application will combine in vitro (including human colonoids) and in vivo murine model systems, as well as use healthy and UC patient stool, to more deeply understand the microbial consortia that collectively maximize P-gp expression and function. Aim 2 is designed to identify the microbial metabolites that drive activation of P-gp expression and eCB secretion to maintain an anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Thus, transcriptomics and metabolite analyses will be performed to provide new information regarding microbial genes, gene clusters, and their metabolic products implicated in maintaining an anti- inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium through regulation of the P-gp/eCB axis. In Aim 3 we will employ novel computational methods will to uncover the inter-microbial network responses and the ecological structure of a stable community that is able to induce P-gp expression. Collectively, knowledge of the pathways that coordinate the maintenance of the P-gp/eCB axis will require a comprehensive understanding of distinct signals regulating intestinal homeostasis, how multiple signals are integrated in the complex intestinal environment, and pathways that modulate host-microbe interactions. Consequently, this proposal will directly advance novel biological principles with guidance of new therapeutic intervention strategies. Public Health Narrative Regulated recruitment and migration of acute inflammatory cells termed neutrophils (PMN) into the intestine and across the specialized epithelium that lines it is critical for host defense, yet dysregulation of this process is associated with disease. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the goal of this proposal will examine whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to maintain a homeostatic anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Understanding this process could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals,10029718,R01DK125407,"['ABCB1 gene', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Apical', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Colitis', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethanolamines', 'Eubacterium', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Intestines', 'Invaded', 'Knowledge', 'Lactobacillus', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'P-Glycoprotein', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Submucosa', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Work', 'Xenobiotic Metabolism', 'arm', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'commensal bacteria', 'design', 'efflux pump', 'first responder', 'healing', 'host colonization', 'host-microbe interactions', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innate immune mechanisms', 'insight', 'intestinal epithelium', 'intestinal homeostasis', 'mathematical model', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'normal microbiota', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'nuclear factor 1', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'theories', 'transcriptomics']",NIDDK,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,560048,0.0060696917306826085
"Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis Despite major advances in prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it remains a major cause of deaths worldwide. As ASCVD is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and impact on this unmet residual risk. One such human polymorphism in the ID3 gene (rs11574) was associated with ASCVD in 3 distinct human cohorts. Notably, this SNP significantly attenuates ID3 function and studies in pre-clinical models confirm a critical role for ID3 in atheroprotection. We have previously shown that loss of ID3 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and promotes VSMC expression of inflammatory factors, processes linked to increase atherosclerosis. In collaboration with Dr. Gary Owens, we have generated a mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and VSMC-specific deletion of ID3 to study ID3-dependent VSMC specific changes during the course of lesion development in the context of the whole animal. We have developed a comprehensive CyTOF panel to identify and quantitate key cellular and intracellular changes in VSMC and other lesional cells in the aorta during the course of atherosclerosis development in these mice. To translate murine findings to humans, we have utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to knock out ID3 and produce the full allelic series of rs11574 in human cells and validated a reproducible system for differentiation of human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to VSMC. We will quantify the changes in VSMC phenotype in iPSC-derived VSMC with the full allelic series of rs11574. To further translate murine findings to humans, intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH) will be measured in human coronary arteries and analyzed with cutting edge image analysis techniques in collaboration with Dr. Milan Sonka at the University of Iowa. As such, our group is uniquely poised to dissect the role of this ASCVD-associated SNP and translate findings to humans. We hypothesize: that loss of ID3 in VSMCs will inhibit VSMC growth and promote a phenotype that exacerbates vessel wall inflammation and atherosclerosis lesion development; that human ID3 encoded by the risk allele aggravates these atherogenic VSMC functions; and that human subjects with the risk allele have larger coronary plaques with increased fatty deposits, necrotic cores and calcification compared to subjects homozygous for the common allele. As atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and further impact on ASCVD morbidity and mortality. Human ID3 gene polymorphism at rs11574 is associated with ASCVD in three unique human cohorts. Preliminary data supports a key role for ID3 in vascular smooth muscle cell biology linked to ASCVD. In the current proposal, we will utilize a novel mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and specific deletion of ID3 to elucidate the role of ID3 in promoting atherogenic VSMCs. We will then utilize CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMCs to identify the VSMC processes altered by the ID3 gene mutation linked to CVD. Lastly, we will determine if this ID3 gene mutation, alone or in combination with other gene mutations are associated with the amount and type of atherosclerotic plaque in human coronary arteries as measured by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology. Results have the potential to lead to novel targeted therapy for atherosclerosis.",Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis,10004164,R01HL148109,"['Alanine', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Aorta', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Iowa', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Necrosis', 'Null Lymphocytes', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Residual state', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Threonine', 'Translating', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'calcification', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary plaque', 'dimer', 'genome editing', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oxidized low density lipoprotein', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,671017,0.0024224892828309387
"Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency Project Abstract Haploinsufficiency plays a crucial role in Neurofibromatosis (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder impacting over 120,000 individuals in the United States. Current therapeutic approaches focus on specific components of NF1 signaling, for example inhibiting MEK signaling pathways in tumors, thus failing to address the broad range of signaling and symptoms associated with NF1. Given that NF1 is characterized by both autosomal dominance and haploinsufficiency (lack of normal protein), upregulating protein expression of the remaining wild-type NF1 allele has the ability to compensate for loss of function from the mutant allele, thus alleviating a broad range of NF1 symptoms and overall disease progression. Infixion proposes to build a luciferase reporting assay to evaluate NF1 expression against known drugs, including 50+ compounds, across six drug classes, already identified by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression. By confirming that these candidate drugs activate NF1 transcription, increase NF1 protein expression, and normalize Ras pathway signaling in NF1 +/- Schwann cells, and by further screening libraries of known drugs for increased NF1 expression, we propose a novel path of NF1 drug discovery that will impact a broad range of NF1 patients and symptoms, in a preventative manner, and without regard to the wide spectrum of NF1 genetic mutations. Research Background. Increasing NF1 expression via transfection reverses abnormal Ras activation resulting from NF1 loss (Wallis, et al. 2018). Transcriptional activation in other genetic conditions such as Willams-Beuren Syndrome, and Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis compensates for haploinsufficiency (Giordano, et al. 2012). Lastly, overcoming haploinsufficiency in another autosomal dominant condition (Sim1 induced obesity; mouse model) was recently shown using a Crispr/dCas9 transcriptional activator (Ahituv, et al. 2019). Specific Aims. 1) Construct a luciferase reporter assay engineered into the endogenous NF1 gene of a well characterized, publically available, immortalized NF1 +/- Schwann cell line (Wallace et al. 2016; data published at Synapse.org). Validate assay using a viral transcription factor developed by Infixion using Crispr/dCas9 to upregulate NF1. 2) Deploy this NF1 luciferase reporter assay to screen 50+ known drugs shown by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression across various cell/tissue types. Next, use this validated luciferase reporter to screen a 13,000+ compound repurposing library of known drugs available from Scripps Research Institute (known as ReFrame). 3) The top hits from Aim 2 screens will be evaluated, utilizing both immortalized and iPSC derived NF1+/- Schwann cells, for the following: a) ability to induce NF1 mRNA and protein expression, using qPCR and Westerns, b) the impact on Ras signaling (pERK, ELK-1, AKT, etc.) utilizing a targeted quantitative mass spec proteomics assay, c) their broader impact on gene expression in Schwann cells utilizing RNAseq, d) impact on cell proliferation, and e) their safety profile based on published data from previous trials. The goal is to prioritize not more than 3-5 candidates to take forward into a Phase 2 evaluation. Project Narrative Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that impacts an estimated 1 in 3000 people worldwide, and one that is characterized by a complex set of symptoms shown to be dependent on haploinsufficiency (i.e., the lack of normal protein). By upregulating NF1 protein expression from the normal allele by two-fold, and thus restoring normal levels of functional NF1 protein in tissues important in NF1, we target a range of NF1 symptoms by eliminating the haploinsufficient environment. We propose to develop and utilize NF1-specific luciferase reporter and proteomic assays, along with standard small molecule evaluation tools, to characterize a small molecule library of repurposed drugs for their ability to upregulate NF1 transcription, and to further evaluate the resulting impact of “hits” on NF1 protein expression, cell proliferation, gene expression specificity, as well as downstream pathways (such as Ras, MEK, mTOR) known to be dysregulated by mutations in the NF1 gene.",Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency,10010298,R43NS117234,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dominant Genetic Conditions', 'Drug Screening', 'ELK1 gene', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Luciferases', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modification', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Obese Mice', 'Orphan Drugs', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Regimen', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schwann Cells', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure of thyroid parafollicular cell', 'Supravalvular aortic stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcend', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Williams Syndrome', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'gene expression database', 'gene therapy', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'in vivo Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Expression', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'phase 2 testing', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,"INFIXION BIOSCIENCE, INC.",R43,2020,299503,0.0011044954888105333
"C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD PROJECT SUMMARY The Candidate is a postdoctoral fellow committed to developing an academic research group focused on applying bioinformatics to understand the pathophysiology of alcohol-related liver diseases (ALD). His previous and current postdoctoral work has given him the unique skillset to answer questions involving gene expression/regulation in the immune system. The Career Development Plan describes 2 years of mentored research wherein the candidate will develop skills in clinical immunology, generate the sequencing data outlined in the proposal, and learn leadership skills to transition into independence. The next 3 years, after obtaining an independent faculty position, will be dedicated to developing new data analysis pipelines and establishing cell biological and bioinformatics tools to understand gene regulation in the innate immune system, which will allow the candidate to establish future projects in ALD immunology. Research Plan: ALD is a spectrum of disorders that affect a growing number of people worldwide. Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that can increase the morbidity and severity of ALD disorders. In AH, the innate immune system is hypersensitive to microbial byproducts. Alcohol consumption causes gut-barrier disruption, leading to leakage of gut microbes into the portal circulation. The liver immune system is able to detect these microbes through pattern recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type Lectin receptors (CTLs). While TLRs have been well studied for their role in sensitizing the innate immune cells to microbial products, the CTLs have only recently been implicated in mouse models of ALD. CTLs are a large family of PRRs that sense a vast diversity of microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Our work has found that many members of the CTL gene family are upregulated in the liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs of AH patients. CTLs were also upregulated in PBMCs in response to LPS/TLR4 signaling. We predict CTLs are upregulated in response to gut- derived LPS in order to increase sensing for other microbes that may be present in the blood, making this pathway a secondary innate immune surveillance pathway. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis in three aims to address the functional role and regulation of this immune surveillance pathway, and the mechanism by which it is exacerbated in AH. First, we will use PBMCs isolated from AH patients to measure increased sensitivity to CTL agonists, as well as micro-/mycobiome sequencing to determine what microbial byproducts were in circulation in patients. Second, we will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the different monocyte subclasses, variation in CTL expression, and how different cell types respond to CTL agonists. Third, because CTL genes are clustered in the genome, we will use scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) to understand co-regulation of nearby genes in the genome. Altogether, this proposal will further our understanding of CTL mediated immune surveillance in host/microbial interactions during AH disease progression and potentially identify new therapeutic targets to decrease inflammation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that causes significant mortality among patients with Alcohol-related liver disease. In this project, we will investigate how the innate immune system and the micro- and myco-biome interact via a family of genes called the C-type lectin receptors (CTLs) to increase inflammation and disease severity among AH patients. The results of this project will expand our understanding of CTLs and immune surveillance, and provide new therapeutic targets for treatment of AH.",C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD,10020883,K99AA028048,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcohols', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'C Type Lectin Receptors', 'C-Type Lectins', 'CD14 gene', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Immunology', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elements', 'Ethanol Metabolism', 'Extravasation', 'FCGR3B gene', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Functional disorder', 'Fungal Components', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunology', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myelogenous', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'TLR4 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toll-like receptors', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transposase', 'Up-Regulation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cytokine', 'data analysis pipeline', 'dectin 1', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fungus', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'immunological diversity', 'immunoregulation', 'inflammatory milieu', 'liver inflammation', 'liver injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'microbial', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'mouse dectin-2', 'mouse model', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'prevent', 'receptor expression', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIAAA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K99,2020,123096,0.0067242818986200876
"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth in patients with refractory PA disease.",DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth,9999533,R01CA230328,"['Acromegaly', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dura Mater', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hypopituitarism', 'In Vitro', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Pituitary-dependent Cushing&apos', 's disease', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Publishing Peer Reviews', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Somatotropin', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'bone', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional status', 'genome-wide', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'methylome', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision drugs', 'prognostic', 'small hairpin RNA', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,525099,-0.008674985038631676
