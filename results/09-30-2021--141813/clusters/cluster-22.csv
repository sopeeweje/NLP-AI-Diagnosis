"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders Project Summary/Abstract This application proposes a training program to integrate the PI, Dr. Varadan's previous research efforts in informatics and machine learning into investigations pertaining to the etiology and progression of Barrett's Esophagus, a gastrointestinal disorder of significant public health interest. Much of Dr. Varadan's previous research has involved developing intelligent algorithms and informatics approaches to decode the interconnections within complex biological systems, with only a basic understanding of the clinical needs and complexities involved in translational research. The proposed project would provide a broad and in-depth mentored experience focused on clinical and biological aspects of Barrett's Esophagus, as well as added knowledge in the use of preclinical model systems to investigate biological mechanisms. The overall goal is to expand the PI's experience and training in the design and conduct of translational studies focused on gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. This objective will be achieved through a combination of didactic and research activities conducted under an exceptional mentoring team of translational researchers at Case Western Reserve University, spanning achievements across clinical management of GI disorders, molecular genetics and inflammatory processes associated with diseases of the gut. Accordingly, this proposal leverages Dr. Varadan's computational background to address an urgent and unmet need within the biomedical research community to develop reliable analytic approaches that can quantify signaling network activities in individual biological samples by integrating multi-omics measurements. We recently conceived a systems biology computational framework, InFlo, which integrates molecular profiling data to decode the functional states of cellular/molecular processes underpinning complex human diseases. Barrett's esophagus is one such complex disease gaining increasing importance to public health, as it is the known precursor to the deadly cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given that the mechanisms underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of Barrett's Esophagus remain elusive, a major objective of this proposal is to employ the InFlo framework combined molecular profiles derived from primary tissue cohorts, in vitro and in vivo model systems to establish the molecular roadmap of BE pathogenesis and disease recurrence, thus elucidating unifying mechanisms underlying this disease. This systems biology approach would enable the development of evidence-based, diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for Barrett's esophagus and inform preventive strategies within at-risk populations. Project Narrative This proposal details a novel systems biology approach to enable seamless integration of patient molecular data to decipher the mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. Using this novel integrative analytics approach, we propose to resolve the molecular basis for the development and recurrence of Barrett's Esophagus, a disease with significant public health importance, since it is a known precursor to a lethal esophageal cancer and the mechanisms underpinning this disease remain largely unknown. The findings from our proposed research will enable the development of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and will also inform preventive strategies in high-risk patient populations.",Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders,9744013,K25DK115904,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Columnar Epithelium', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Ephrins', 'Epithelium', 'Esophageal', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophagitis', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gene Expression', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proliferating', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Squamous Epithelium', 'Stem cells', 'Stomach', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'computer framework', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'in vivo Model', 'injury and repair', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'resistance mechanism', 'standard of care', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational scientist', 'translational study']",NIDDK,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,K25,2019,171720,0.03539050116129412

"Development of dictyBase, an online informatics resource PROJECT SUMMARY dictyBase is the model organism database (MOD) for the eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum and related species. A community resource, widely supported by the research community, dictyBase contains gold standard expert literature curation of genes, functional annotations using the Gene Ontology and a wide range of genomic resources. Dictyostelium is widely used to study cellular processes such as cell motility, chemotaxis, signal transduction, cellular response to drugs, and host-pathogen interactions. Dictyostelium's genome contains significant orthologs of vertebrate, yeast and microbial genes, attracting researchers interested in a wide variety of biological topics including human disease, multicellular differentiation and comparative genomics. dictyBase enables researchers to search, view and download up-to-date genomic, functional and technical information. It is also widely used by teachers/instructors due to the wealth of available teaching materials and research protocols. Dictyostelium investigators depend on dictyBase as their primary community resource, where help from dictyBase staff (dictyBase help line) or from other users (Dicty ListServ, moderated by dictyBase) is available. We are in the final stages of deploying our completely new technology stack. By the end of this year dictyBase will be run entirely as a cloud-based application. This propoal seeks support to continue operating and expanding this important community resource. Our goals for this proposal are: (Aim 1) To continue (a) expert curation by dictyBase curators and enable (b) Community curation leveraging our strong relationship with the community. We will use additional sequence data to (c) update the AX4 reference genome sequence and improve the efficiency of curation by using (d) Deep learning-based linking of papers to genes prioritizing them for further analysis and curation. (Aim 2) We will improve dictyBase utility and usability by implementing (a) Bulk annotation methods for importing large-scale data sets using both (i) a web interface and (ii) a script/command line method. (b) We will add 10 additional Dictyostelid genomes using automated methods to annotate them. We will improve usability by implementing a (c) concurrent blast search with a new user interface and integrate this with the JBrowse display. (Aim 3) To expand the data and increase the richness of annotations available in dictyBase we will implement mechanisms to capture, store and display: (a) additional context to GO annotations (i) using existing GO extensions and (ii) annotating and displaying biological pathways using GO CAM models; (b) integrate and display genome wide insertion mutant information for over 20 thousand insertional mutants; and (c) develop a graphical display of spatial expression data using Dictyostelium anatomy ontology terms (i) by adding a track in JBrowse for genes annotated with spatial / anatomy expression terms, and (ii) creating a graphical display of these annotations via our Circos-based dashboard tool. As other data sets become available we will add them to dictyBase and develop methods to display the data and make it searchable. PROJECT NARRATIVE dictyBase is the model organism database (MOD) for the eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum and related species, Dictyostelium is widely used for research in the biomedical, genetic, and environmental domains.

"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases.

"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will create a web-accessible system that will enable biologists and clinicians to generate hypotheses regarding disease-linked genes, molecular mechanisms underlying genetic disorders, and drug discovery for more targeted treatment. Underlying this user-friendly web interface will be novel algorithms for on-the-fly integration of  vast amount of functional genomics and quantitative genetics data based on the context(s) defined by the biologist or clinician.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.

"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will create a web-accessible system that will enable biologists and clinicians to generate hypotheses regarding disease-linked genes, molecular mechanisms underlying genetic disorders, and drug discovery for more targeted treatment. Underlying this user-friendly web interface will be novel algorithms for on-the-fly integration of  vast amount of functional genomics and quantitative genetics data based on the context(s) defined by the biologist or clinician. As applied to the three case study areas, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders, our system has the potential to identify novel disease genes and pathways and to enable development of better diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets, and, in the longer term, treatments.",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,9057057,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Imagery', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ubiquitination', 'Update', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'research study', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,445349,0.06649851057487131

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.

"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders. Our application of this system to generate cell-lineage specific functional networks will lead to a better understanding of the glomerulus function and will directly benefit human health through the development of improved predictors, diagnoses, and treatments for microvascular disease.

"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders.

"ISMB 2012 Conference Support for Students & Young Scientists     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 2012 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in will be held in Long Beach, California, with 1,500-1,700 attendees, including 33-38% students/post doctoral researchers. ISMB brings together graduate students, post doctoral researchers, faculty, research staff and senior scientists of many different nationalities, all of whom are studying or working in computer science, molecular biology, mathematics or statistics. The conference brings biologists and computational scientists together to focus on research centered on actual biological problems rather than simply theoretical calculations. The combined focus on ""intelligent systems"" and actual biological data makes ISMB a highly relevant meeting, and many years of producing the event has resulted in a professionally organized and respected annual conference. The ISMB conference presents the latest research methods and results developed through the application of computer programming to the study of biological sciences, including advances in sequencing genomes that may lead to a better understanding of how, for instance, cells interact for the treatment of diseases such as cancer. Presentations may describe methods and advances associated with the analysis of existing biological literature, including benchmarking experiments, to create a better public understanding of scientific research reports. Overall, ISMB serves to educate attendees on the latest developments that will further drive the research methods and results of the field of computational biology. Students and scientists are able to return to their labs to appy what they have learned as they advance their own research efforts or begin investigating new areas they were exposed to as a result of attending ISMB. The scientific program for each ISMB meeting includes parallel presentation tracks of original research papers, highlights of recently published papers, special sessions focused on emerging topics, technology demos, late breaking research and poster presentations, an art in science exhibition, tutorial workshops, special interest group meetings and a student symposium organized by and for students. For ISMB 2011, 258 original research papers were submitted and 48 selected for the Proceedings Track, while 88 previously published papers were submitted and 38 selected for the Highlights Track. In all, over 225 talks were presented during the course of the 2011 conference, and similar numbers are anticipated for 2012. In all cases, submissions are rigorously reviewed, typically by three members of each track's committee before approval by the track chair, insuring the highest possible quality of work is presented. The specific areas represented in the conference vary each year depending on the areas that researchers find most interesting and innovative, and therefore submit as papers and proposals. This proposal seeks funding to assist students and junior researchers in attending the conference, thus exposing them to the latest research of their own areas as well as areas that may be new to them.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems, largely driven by genomic sequence efforts due to the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it. The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference series directly addresses these questions by showcasing the latest advances in the field and exposing what's on the horizon of future discoveries, but is distinguished from many other events in computational biology or artificial intelligence by an insistence that the researchers work with real molecular biology data, not theoretical or toy examples. Although the cultures of computer science and biology are so disparate, ISMB bridges this cultural gap by providing a forum among biological conferences that features technical advances as they occur, which otherwise may be shunned until a firm experimental result is published.              Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems, largely driven by genomic sequence efforts due to the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases.

"ISMB 2011 Conference Support for Students & Young Scientists    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ISMB 2011 Conference Travel Support for Students and Young Scientists.  The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in 2011 will be held in Vienna, Austria, as a conference of approximately 1,500-1,700 attendees, including 33-38% students/post doctoral researchers. ISMB brings together graduate students, post doctoral researchers, faculty, research staff and senior scientists of many different nationalities, all of whom are studying or working in computer science, molecular biology, mathematics and/or statistics. The conference brings biologists and computational scientists together to focus on research centered on actual biological problems rather than simply theoretical calculations. The combined focus on ""intelligent systems"" and actual biological data makes ISMB a highly relevant meeting, and many years of producing the event has resulted in a well organized, well attended, and respected annual conference. The ISMB conference presents the latest research methods and results developed through the application of computer programming to the study of biological sciences, including advances in sequencing genomes that may lead to a better understanding of how, for instance, cells interact for the treatment of diseases such as cancer. Additionally, presentations may describe methods and advances associated with the analysis of existing biological literature, including benchmarking experiments, to create a better public understanding of scientific research reports. Overall, ISMB serves to educate attendees on the latest developments that will further drive the research methods and results of the field of computational biology. Students and scientists are able to return to their labs to apply what they have learned as they advance their own research efforts. The scientific program for each ISMB meeting comprises parallel presentation tracks of original research papers, highlights of recently published research, topically focused special sessions on emerging topics, technology demos, tutorial workshops, special interest group meetings and a student symposium organized by and for students. As an example, for ISMB 2010, 234 original research papers were submitted and 48 selected for the Proceedings Track; 126 published papers were submitted and 42 selected for the Highlights Track; nine proposals were submitted and four selected for presentation along with two invited for the Special Sessions Track. In all, well over 200 talks were presented during the course of the 2010 conference, and similar numbers are anticipated for 2011. In all cases, submissions are rigorously reviewed, typically by three members of each track's committee before approval by the track chair, insuring the highest possible quality of work is presented. The specific areas represented in the conference vary each year depending on the areas that researchers find most interesting and innovative, and therefore submit as papers and proposals. This proposal seeks funding to assist students and junior researchers in attending the conference, thus exposing them to the latest research of their own areas as well as areas that may be new to them.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems. The widespread recognition of bioinformatics has been largely driven by genomic sequence efforts, because laboratory scientists recognize that the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it. Biologists are routinely integrating computational tools into their research programs and creating large predictive models based on information found in databases and other electronic resources. The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference series directly addresses these questions by showcasing the latest advances in the field, as well as exposing what's on the horizon of future discoveries.           Relevance Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems.

"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders. Our application of this system to generate cell-lineage specific functional networks will lead to a better understanding of the glomerulus function and will directly benefit human health through the development of improved predictors, diagnoses, and treatments for microvascular disease.              Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders.

"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model forth understanding of chromosome maintenance, the cell cycle and cellular biology.

"Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent and continuing technological advances are producing large amounts of disparate data about cell structure, function and activity.

The visualization tool is able to reversibly group related sets of nodes, and display and duplicate their internal structure, providing an approach to hierarchical representation and modeling. We propose to build further on these unique features by including capabilities for mining and representing chemical reactions, orthologous networks, combinatorially regulated transcriptional networks, splice variants and functional hierarchies.

"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently a gap exists between the explosion of high-throughput data generation in molecular biology and the relatively slower growth of reliable functional information extracted from the data. This gap is largely due to the lack of specificity necessary for accurate gene function prediction in the currently available large-scale experimental technologies for rapid protein function assessment. Bioinformatics methods that integrate diverse data sources in their analysis achieve higher accuracy and thus alleviate this lack of specificity, but there's a paucity of generalizable, efficient, and accurate methods for data integration. In addition, no efficient methods exist to effectively display diverse genomic data, even though visualization has been very valuable for analysis of data from large scale technologies such as gene expression microarrays. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop an accurate and generalizable bioinformatics framework for integrated analysis and visualization of heterogeneous biological data.      We propose to address the data integration problem with a Bayesian network approach and effective visualization methods. We have shown the efficacy of this method in a proof-of-principle system that increased the accuracy of gene function prediction for Saccharomyces cerevisiae compared to individual data sources. Building on our previous work, we present a two-part plan to improve and expand our system and to develop novel visualization methods for genomic data based on the scalable display technology.

"WormBase: a core data resource for C elegans and other nematodes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Caenorhabditis elegans is a major model system for basic biological and biomedical research and the first animal for which there is a complete description of its genome, anatomy and development, and some information about each of its ~22,000 genes. Five years of funding is requested to maintain and expand WormBase, a Model Organism Database (MOD), with complete coverage of core genomic, genetic, anatomical and functional information about this and other nematodes. Such a database is necessary to allow the entire biomedical research community to make full use of nematode genomic sequences. The two top priorities will be intensive data curation and user interface improvement. WormBase will include up-to-date annotation of the genomic data, the current genetic and physical maps and many experimental data such as genome-scale datasets connected to the function and interactions of cells and genes, as well as development, physiology and behavior. Direct access to the sources of biological material, such as the strain collection of the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center and direct links to data sets maintained by others will be provided. Data will be recovered from the existing resources, from direct contribution of the individual laboratories, and from the literature. While WormBase will act as a central forum through which every laboratory will be able to contribute constructively to the global effort to fully comprehend this metazoan organism, WormBase professional curators will ensure detailed attribution of data sources and check consistency and integrity. To facilitate communication, WormBase will use technology, terminology and style concordant with other databases wherever possible. WormBase will maintain ontologies for nematode anatomy and phenotypes. WormBase will be Web-based and easy to use. Multiple relational databases will be used for data management; the object-based Acedb database system will be used for integration, and this integrated database plus ""slave"" relational databases will be used to drive the website. Coordination of the project and the main curation site will be at Caltech under the supervision of a C. elegans biologist. Curation and annotation of genomic sequence will take place at the centers - the Sanger Institute and Washington University - that generated the entire genome sequence.

"Semantics and Services enabled Problem Solving Environment for Trypanosoma cruzi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of complex biological systems increasingly depends on vast amounts of dynamic information from diverse sources. The scientific analysis of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T.cruzi), the principal causative agent of human Chagas disease, is the driving biological application of this proposal. Approximately 18 million people, predominantly in Latin America, are infected with the T.cruzi parasite. As many as 40 percent of these are predicted eventually to suffer from Chagas disease, which is the leading cause of heart disease and sudden death in middle-aged adults in the region. Research on T. cruzi is therefore an important human disease related effort. It has reached a critical juncture with the quantities of experimental data being generated by labs around the world, due in large part to the publication of the T.cruzi genome in 2005. Although this research has the potential to improve human health significantly, the data being generated exist in independent heterogeneous databases with poor integration and accessibility. The scientific objectives of this research proposal are to develop and deploy a novel ontology-driven semantic problem-solving environment (PSE) for T.cruzi. This is in collaboration with the National Center for Biomedical Ontologies (NCBO) and will leverage its resources to achieve the objectives of this proposal as well as effectively to disseminate results to the broader life science community, including researchers in human pathogens. The PSE allows the dynamic integration of local and public data to answer biological questions at multiple levels of granularity. The PSE will utilize state-of- the-art semantic technologies for effective querying of multiple databases and, just as important, feature an intuitive and comprehensive set of interfaces for usability and easy adoption by biologists. Included in the multimodal datasets will be the genomic data and the associated bioinformatics predictions, functional information from metabolic pathways, experimental data from mass spectrometry and microarray experiments, and textual information from Pubmed. Researchers will be able to use and contribute to a rigorously curated T.cruzi knowledge base that will make it reusable and extensible. The resources developed as part of this proposal will be also useful to researchers in T.cruzi related kinetoplastids, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major (among other pathogenic organisms), which use similar research protocols and face similar informatics challenges. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The scientific objective of this proposal is to develop and deploy a novel ontology-driven semantic problem-solving environment (PSE) for Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that infects approximately 18 million people, predominantly in Latin America. As many as 40 percent of those infected are predicted to eventually suffer from Chagas disease, the leading cause of heart disease and sudden death in middle-aged adults in the region. Facilitating T.cruzi research through the PSE, with the aim of identifying vaccine, diagnostic, and therapeutic targets, is an important human disease related endeavor.          n/a",Semantics and Services enabled Problem Solving Environment for Trypanosoma cruzi,7428761,R01HL087795,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Automobile Driving', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body of uterus', 'Buffaloes', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chagas Disease', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Doctor of Public Health', 'Drops', 'Drosophila genus', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronics', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Imagery', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'Information Resources', 'Information Services', 'Information Technology', 'International', 'Internet', 'Interruption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Organism', 'Language', 'Latin America', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Leishmania major', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oregon', 'Organism', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Philosophy', 'Physiology', 'Prevention strategy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Range', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Sudden Death', 'Sum', 'System', 'TAF8 gene', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trypanosoma brucei brucei', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'USA Georgia', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vaccines', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Victoria Austrailia', 'Virtual Library', 'Virus', 'Western Asia Georgia', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical scientist', 'college', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'computer science', 'concept', 'data integration', 'design', 'desire', 'fundamental research', 'human disease', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovative technologies', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'outreach', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'repository', 'research and development', 'research study', 'syntax', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,393930,0.02097174346895035
"Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent and continuing technological advances are producing large amounts of disparate data about cell structure, function and activity. This is driving the development of tools for storing, mining, analyzing, visualizing and integrating data. This proposal describes the VisANT system: a tool for visual data mining that operates on a local database which includes results from our lab, as well as automatically updated proteomics data from web accessible databases such as MIPS and BIND. In addition to accessing its own database, a name normalization table (i.e. a dictionary of identifiers), permits the system to seamlessly retrieve sequence, disease and other data from sources such as GenBank and OMIM. The visualization tool is able to reversibly group related sets of nodes, and display and duplicate their internal structure, providing an approach to hierarchical representation and modeling. We propose to build further on these unique features by including capabilities for mining and representing chemical reactions, orthologous networks, combinatorially regulated transcriptional networks, splice variants and functional hierarchies. Software is open source, and the system also allows users to exchange and integrate the networks that they discover with those of others.           n/a","Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis",7287965,R01RR022971,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genbank', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Information Systems', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Numbers', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Score', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'data mining', 'improved', 'models and simulation', 'open source', 'outreach', 'protein protein interaction', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web-accessible', 'wiki']",NCRR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2007,446875,0.048659312531889806
"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently a gap exists between the explosion of high-throughput data generation in molecular biology and the relatively slower growth of reliable functional information extracted from the data. This gap is largely due to the lack of specificity necessary for accurate gene function prediction in the currently available large-scale experimental technologies for rapid protein function assessment. Bioinformatics methods that integrate diverse data sources in their analysis achieve higher accuracy and thus alleviate this lack of specificity, but there's a paucity of generalizable, efficient, and accurate methods for data integration. In addition, no efficient methods exist to effectively display diverse genomic data, even though visualization has been very valuable for analysis of data from large scale technologies such as gene expression microarrays. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop an accurate and generalizable bioinformatics framework for integrated analysis and visualization of heterogeneous biological data.      We propose to address the data integration problem with a Bayesian network approach and effective visualization methods. We have shown the efficacy of this method in a proof-of-principle system that increased the accuracy of gene function prediction for Saccharomyces cerevisiae compared to individual data sources. Building on our previous work, we present a two-part plan to improve and expand our system and to develop novel visualization methods for genomic data based on the scalable display technology. First, we will investigate the computational and theoretical issues behind accurate integration, analysis and effective visualization of heterogeneous high-throughput data. Then, leveraging our existing system and algorithmic improvements developed in the first part of the project, we will design and implement a full-scale data integration and function prediction system for Saccharomyces cerevisiae that will be incorporated with the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), a model organism database for yeast.      The proposed system would provide highly accurate automatic function prediction that can accelerate genomic functional annotation through targeted experimental testing. Furthermore, our system will perform general integration and will offer researchers a unified view of the diverse high-throughput data through effective integration and visualization tools, thereby facilitating hypothesis generation and data analysis. Our scalable visualization methods will enable teams of researchers to examine biological data interactively and thus support the highly collaborative nature of genomic research. In addition to contributing to S. cerevisiae genomics, the technology for efficient and accurate heterogeneous data integration and visualization developed as a result of this proposal will form a basis for systems that address the same set of issues for other organisms, including the human. n/a",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,7214148,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Compatible', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Explosion', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Phenotype', 'Pliability', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteomics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Saccharomyces', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'concept', 'data integration', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome database', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'parallel computing', 'programs', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'research study', 'software development', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'ultra high resolution', 'web interface']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,240927,0.06716358866471045
"Computer System for Functional Analysis of Genomic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In two previous stages of this project, both funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and carried out successfully, we developed GeneWays, a completely automated system that efficiently distills information about molecular interactions from an astronomical number of full-text biomedical articles. The next logical stage of the project is to carry this system from the computational laboratory into a practical, useful, and even indispensable tool that researchers can use to solve complex problems currently posed in experimental medicine and biology. The central hypothesis of our work on GeneWays has been that our computational tools will generate biological predictions of a quality sufficiently high that the biomedical community will invest in serious experimental validation. Specifically, we propose the following. 1. We will improve significantly the precision and recall of the GeneWays system. 2. We will develop and implement a probabilistic belief-network formalism?a belief-graph relative of the Bayesian network formalism that allows us to place and update beliefs on both the vertices and the edges of the graph for probabilistic reasoning over the large collection of facts in the GeneWays database. We will develop and implement a coordinated collection of methods for computing and updating beliefs on individual nodes and edges of the belief graph. 3. We will develop and implement a mathematical framework for incorporating pathway information into a genetic- linkage analysis formalism in such a way that each piece of pathway knowledge includes a specified degree of confidence. 4. We will process an enormous collection of texts, such as open-access biomedical journals, PubMed abstracts, and the GeneWays corpus, and thus will build a comprehensive GeneHighWays database. We will make the GeneHighWays database easily and freely accessible to academic researchers through a web interface. We will evaluate the new version of the GeneWays system and the GeneHighWays database for the quality of data, performance of the mathematical methods, and quality of the interface.           n/a",Computer System for Functional Analysis of Genomic Data,7148274,R01GM061372,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'biological signal transduction', 'biomedical automation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'high throughput technology', 'intermolecular interaction', 'method development', 'molecular biology information system', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,303688,0.010056739579799792
"BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration& Analysis System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to collaborate with a group of biology researchers with real world needs to develop and distribute a general-purpose system (BioMediator) to permit integration and analysis of diverse types of biologic data. BioMediator will combine information from a variety of different public and private sources (e.g. experimental data) to help answer biologic questions. BioMediator builds on the foundations laid by the currently funded GeneSeek data integration system. The GeneSeek system was originally developed to query only public domain data sources (both structured and semi-structured) to assist in the curation of the GeneClinics genetic testing knowledge base. The specific aims leading to the development of the BioMediator system are: 1) Interface to additional public domain biological data sources (e.g. pathway databases, function databases). 2) Incorporate access to private databases of experimental results (e.g. proteomics and expression array data). 3) Extend model to include analytic tools operating across distributed biological data sources (e.g. across a set of both proteomic and expression array data). 4) Evolve centralized BioMediator system into a model peer to peer data sharing and analysis system. 5) Distribute and maintain BioMediator production software as a resource for the biological community. The health relatedness of the project is that biologists seeking to understand the molecular basis of human health and disease are struggling with large and increasing volumes of diverse data (mutation, expression array, proteomic) that need to be brought together (integrated) and analyzed in order to develop and test hypotheses about disease mechanisms and normal physiology. The research design is to develop BioMediator by combining and leverage recent developments in a) the domain of open source analytic tools for biologic data and b) ongoing theoretical and applied research by members of the current GeneSeek research team on both general purpose and biologic data integration systems. The methods are:  a) to use an iterative rapid prototyping software development model evaluated in a real-world test bed and b) to expand the existing GeneSeek research team (with expertise in informatics, computer science, and software development) to include biological expertise (four biologists forming a biology working group) and biostatistics expertise.

The specific aims leading to the development of the BioMediator system are: 1) Interface to additional public domain biological data sources (e.g. pathway databases, function databases). 2) Incorporate access to private databases of experimental results (e.g. proteomics and expression array data). 3) Extend model to include analytic tools operating across distributed biological data sources (e.g. across a set of both proteomic and expression array data). 4) Evolve centralized BioMediator system into a model peer to peer data sharing and analysis system. 5) Distribute and maintain BioMediator production software as a resource for the biological community. The health relatedness of the project is that biologists seeking to understand the molecular basis of human health and disease are struggling with large and increasing volumes of diverse data (mutation, expression array, proteomic) that need to be brought together (integrated) and analyzed in order to develop and test hypotheses about disease mechanisms and normal physiology. The research design is to develop BioMediator by combining and leverage recent developments in a) the domain of open source analytic tools for biologic data and b) ongoing theoretical and applied research by members of the current GeneSeek research team on both general purpose and biologic data integration systems. The methods are:  a) to use an iterative rapid prototyping software development model evaluated in a real-world test bed and b) to expand the existing GeneSeek research team (with expertise in informatics, computer science, and software development) to include biological expertise (four biologists forming a biology working group) and biostatistics expertise. The goal is to ensure the BioMediator system 1) meets the needs of a group of end users acquiring, integrating and analyzing diverse biologic data sets, 2) does so in a scaleable and expandable manner drawing on the latest theoretical developments in data analysis and integration. n/a",BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration & Analysis System,6681249,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' information retrieval', ' molecular biology information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2003,100000,0.08358286879495842
"Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to delineate (at least in theory) all the proteins encoded in the human genome and all of those encoded by the genomes of major human parasites has given us an unprecedented opportunity to address the causes and treatment of every major human disease.  However, the vast increase in biological knowledge that has resulted from the last decade of genomic DNA sequencing has led us to a a crisis in bioinformatics.  This crisis is two-fold: analysis of data and planning of experiments.  Most of the scientific resources being expended in bioinformatics are being spent on data analysis tools. While these are essential, we should not neglect the opportunity to accelerate the progress of actual experimental biology.  All modern experimental molecular biology (and, increasingly, structural biology) depends upon the availability of plasmid clones to address specific scientific questions.  Although software facilitating DNA manipulations exists, few programs advise users of optimal strategies and none automate the process of clone generation. Genomics initiatives identify proteins at the genome level and demand the generation of hundreds of expression clones for recombinant protein production in exogenous hosts such as E. coli.  Establishment of libraries of expression clones requires automation and optimization as well as effective means of data storage, archiving, annotation and query.  To address these needs, as well as to facilitate routine DNA manipulations in virtually any molecular biology laboratory, we propose (1) to test and build a task centered virtual cloning expert system that serves as a knowledge base for DNA manipulations, and (2) to test and build an information automaton for the construction of expression clone libraries in support of structural genomics initiatives and other high throughput experiments.         n/a",Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning,6583437,R43GM067279,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' expression cloning', ' gene expression', ' genetic library', ' genetic manipulation', ' informatics', ' molecular biology information system', ' transfection /expression vector']",NIGMS,"VIRMATICS, LLC",R43,2003,100000,0.0041044648188840824

"Functional Genomics Software   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): A substantial commercial potential exists        for software tools that allow a biomedical research scientist to use genomic         data to form experimentally testable hypotheses. These will be used to exploit       genomic sequence data to understand the aetiology of disease, to improve             diagnostic tools, and to develop more effective therapies. The Master Catalog,       a commercial product developed jointly by EraGen Biosciences and the Benner          laboratory at the University of Florida, provides a convenient framework for         implementing heuristics that do this. The Master Catalog is a naturally              organized database that contains evolutionary trees, multiple sequence               alignments, and reconstructed evolutionary intermediates for all of the              proteins in the GenBank database. The Benner laboratory has developed and            anecdotally tested heuristics that date events in the molecular history,             provide evidence for and against functional recruitment within a protein             family, detect distant homologs, associate individual residues important for         functional changes with a crystal structure, find metabolic and regulatory           pathways, and correlate events in the molecular record with the history of life      on Earth. This Phase I proposal seeks to validate a set of these heuristics          more broadly to determine their suitability for database-wide application. In        Phase II, we will implement these within the Master Catalog, and launch a            commercial bioinformatics product to support functional analysis of genomic          databases.                                                                           PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  In its present version, the Master Catalog is a successful commercial product within a  niche: ""best in class"" of bioinformatics databases.  Adding a validated set of heuristics  for extracting functional information from genome databases will make it the software  of choice for most functional genomics work, and be a central tool in the pharmaceutical/  biotechnology industries.  Academic versions and student versions will find markets in most  universities.                                                                                      n/a",Functional Genomics Software,6337786,R41HG002331,"['artificial intelligence', ' biochemical evolution', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' functional /structural genomics', ' informatics', ' molecular biology information system', ' nucleic acid sequence']",NHGRI,"ERAGEN BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R41,2001,96855,0.025014068006464368

"National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) is to advance the science of biological networks by creating leading-edge bioinformatic methods, software tools and infrastructure, and by engaging the scientific community in a portfolio of collaboration and training opportunities. Much of biomedical research is dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types and scales, including molecular interactions among genes, proteins, metabolites and drugs; cell communication systems; relationships among genotypes and biological and clinical phenotypes; and patient and social networks. NRNB-supported platforms like Cytoscape are among the most widely used software tools in biology, with tens of thousands of active users, enabling researchers to apply network concepts and data to understand biological systems and how they are reprogrammed in disease.  NRNB’s three Technology Research and Development projects introduce innovative concepts with the potential to transform network biology, transitioning it from a static to a dynamic science (TR&D 1); from flat network diagrams to multi-scale hierarchies of biological structure and function (TR&D 2); and from descriptive interaction maps to predictive and interpretable machine learning models (TR&D 3). In previous funding periods our technology projects have produced novel and highly cited approaches, including network-based biomarkers for stratification of disease, data-driven gene ontologies assembled completely from network data, and deep learning models of cell structure and function built using biological networks as a scaffold.  During the next period of support, we introduce dynamic regulatory networks formulated from single-cell transcriptomics and advanced proteomics data (TR&D 1); substantially improved methodology for the study of hierarchical structure and pleiotropy in biological networks (TR&D 2); and procedures for using networks to seed machine learning models of drug response that are both mechanistically interpretable and transferable across biomedical contexts (TR&D 3). These efforts are developed and applied in close collaboration with outside investigators from 19 Driving Biomedical Projects who specialize in experimental generation of network data, disease biology (cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes), single-cell developmental biology, and clinical trials. TR&Ds are also bolstered by 7 Technology Partnerships in which NRNB scientists coordinate technology development with leading resource-development groups in gene function prediction, mathematics and algorithm development, and biomedical databases. Beyond these driving collaborations, we continually support a broader portfolio of transient (non-driving) research collaborations; organize and lead international meetings including the popular Network Biology track of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference; and deliver a rich set of training opportunities and network analysis protocols. OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We are all familiar with some of the components of biological systems – DNA, proteins, cells, organs, individuals – but understanding biological systems involves more than just cataloging its component parts. It is critical to understand the many interactions of these parts within systems, and how these systems give rise to biological functions and responses and determine states of health and disease.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders Project Summary/Abstract This application proposes a training program to integrate the PI, Dr. Varadan's previous research efforts in informatics and machine learning into investigations pertaining to the etiology and progression of Barrett's Esophagus, a gastrointestinal disorder of significant public health interest. Much of Dr. Varadan's previous research has involved developing intelligent algorithms and informatics approaches to decode the interconnections within complex biological systems, with only a basic understanding of the clinical needs and complexities involved in translational research. The proposed project would provide a broad and in-depth mentored experience focused on clinical and biological aspects of Barrett's Esophagus, as well as added knowledge in the use of preclinical model systems to investigate biological mechanisms. The overall goal is to expand the PI's experience and training in the design and conduct of translational studies focused on gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. This objective will be achieved through a combination of didactic and research activities conducted under an exceptional mentoring team of translational researchers at Case Western Reserve University, spanning achievements across clinical management of GI disorders, molecular genetics and inflammatory processes associated with diseases of the gut. Accordingly, this proposal leverages Dr. Varadan's computational background to address an urgent and unmet need within the biomedical research community to develop reliable analytic approaches that can quantify signaling network activities in individual biological samples by integrating multi-omics measurements. We recently conceived a systems biology computational framework, InFlo, which integrates molecular profiling data to decode the functional states of cellular/molecular processes underpinning complex human diseases. Barrett's esophagus is one such complex disease gaining increasing importance to public health, as it is the known precursor to the deadly cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given that the mechanisms underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of Barrett's Esophagus remain elusive, a major objective of this proposal is to employ the InFlo framework combined molecular profiles derived from primary tissue cohorts, in vitro and in vivo model systems to establish the molecular roadmap of BE pathogenesis and disease recurrence, thus elucidating unifying mechanisms underlying this disease. This systems biology approach would enable the development of evidence-based, diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for Barrett's esophagus and inform preventive strategies within at-risk populations. Project Narrative This proposal details a novel systems biology approach to enable seamless integration of patient molecular data to decipher the mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. Using this novel integrative analytics approach, we propose to resolve the molecular basis for the development and recurrence of Barrett's Esophagus, a disease with significant public health importance, since it is a known precursor to a lethal esophageal cancer and the mechanisms underpinning this disease remain largely unknown. The findings from our proposed research will enable the development of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and will also inform preventive strategies in high-risk patient populations.",Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders,9888378,K25DK115904,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Columnar Epithelium', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Ephrins', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophageal Tissue', 'Esophagitis', 'Esophagus', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gene Expression', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proliferating', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Squamous Epithelium', 'Stomach', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'computer framework', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'in vivo Model', 'injury and repair', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'resistance mechanism', 'standard of care', 'stem cells', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational scientist', 'translational study']",NIDDK,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,K25,2020,171720,0.03539050116129412
"Synthetic Biology: At the Crossroads of Genetic Engineering and Human Therapeutics Abstract Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Synthetic Biology: At the Crossroads of Genetic Engineering and Human Therapeutics, organized by Drs. Jose M. Lora and Timothy K. Lu. The conference will be held in Breckenridge, Colorado from March 29- April 1, 2019. Synthetic Biology tools and principles have matured tremendously over the last decade and have reached extraordinary levels of sophistication, both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. Synthetic biology as a therapeutic modality is starting to enter multiple clinical studies and has the potential to have a significant impact on medicine across a wide range of diseases (e.g., metabolic, immune-mediated, cancer, and neurologic diseases). This Keystone Symposia conference will delve into the field of synthetic biology with a special emphasis on its applications to medicine. While there are conferences that capture synthetic biology in only a few talks mixed in among other various topics, there is a paucity of conferences focused on synthetic biology as drugs to treat disease. However, due to the rapid pace of fundamental scientific advances along with an expanding number of biotechnology companies and emerging clinical studies with synthetic biology at their core, this conference will be highly relevant for a wide audience of scientists both from academia and industry. In addition, other meetings in this field have a highly technology-driven focus on synthetic biology techniques with relatively little attention given to biological and medical context. Ultimately, this Keystone Symposia conference should inspire researchers from diverse backgrounds to discuss synthetic biology via many new angles. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past two decades, tremendous advances have been made in the use of biological parts to engineer systems that can effectively direct living cells for a vast variety of purposes (a.k.a. synthetic biology). Synthetic biology is being used to construct more effective therapies in diseases such as cancer, but there are remaining obstacles to the clinical translation of these therapies. This Keystone Symposia conference will delve into the field of synthetic biology with a special emphasis on its applications to medicine.",Synthetic Biology: At the Crossroads of Genetic Engineering and Human Therapeutics,9913772,R13EB029305,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Research', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Colorado', 'Computers', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Screening', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel diagnostics', 'posters', 'symposium', 'synthetic biology', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIBIB,KEYSTONE SYMPOSIA,R13,2020,10000,0.02668503029999518
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.
