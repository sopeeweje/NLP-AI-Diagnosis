"Software for Antibody Epitope Prediction Accurate epitope prediction is important for the development of antibody-based therapies. When multiple new antibodies are discovered against the whole antigen, their epitopes and, therefore, potential novelty and mechanism of action are usually unknown Site-directed mutagenesis, the routine method for epitope mapping, requires testing a large number of mutants since any part of the antigen can potentially form an epitope The goal of this proposal is developing methodology and software for the accurate computational prediction of discontinuous B-cell epitopes based on the structure of an antigen and the structure or sequence of an antibody. Our starting point is PIPER, a protein-protein docking program licensed by Acpharis from Boston University. PIPER is the docking engine in the software packages BioLuminate by Schrodinger and the CyrusBench Suite of Cyrus Biotechnology, as well as in the public server ClusPro. PIPER has a special option for antibody-antigen docking, and has been used for epitope prediction. However, in its present form the software generally results in a high number of putative epitopes, and more accurate prediction requires substantial experimental efforts, e.g., by site-directed mutagenesis. We will modify PIPER to maximize the information available from the docking by generating a large ensemble of low energy docked structures and calculating a contact map rather than discrete docked structures. The number of potential epitopes will be further reduced by a template-based approach based on vector contact maps to characterize antibody-antigen interfaces. We also explore predicting the epitope based on models of the CDR regions. Generating large ensembles of docked structures with a large variety of CDR conformations will reduce the sensitivity of the method to inevitable modeling and docking uncertainty. By increasing the reliability of the predicted epitopes, we expect to reduce or even to eliminate the need for mutagenesis experiments. Finally, we will develop a machine- learning algorithm for the mapping of amino acid composition of CDR regions into epitope composition, a method that can be used when only the antibody sequence available and structure prediction is uncertain due to the lack of suitable templates. When multiple new antibodies are discovered against a whole antigen, their epitopes and, therefore, potential novelty and mechanism of action are usually unknown. Computational software tools can significantly reduce experimental efforts required for epitope determination by guiding experimental efforts toward most probable epitope locations. We propose new computational capabilities based on protein-protein docking and machine learning, which are specifically designed to improve the accuracy of epitope prediction.",Software for Antibody Epitope Prediction,9845171,R43GM134769,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Binding Sites', 'Antibody Therapy', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Base Sequence', 'Biotechnology', 'Boston', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes', 'Goals', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Scheme', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface Antigens', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mutant', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'vector']",NIGMS,"ACPHARIS, INC.",R43,2019,149999,0.026114048262835993
"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease. Project Narrative This project develops computational tools for accurately determining protein structure from low- resolution experimental data. The proposed work will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to model dynamic structures from sparse data. Obtaining accurate structures from this data will reveal insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function, and what goes wrong in human disease.",Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data,9768492,R01GM123089,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Goals', 'Homologous Gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Refit', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Torsion', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X ray diffraction analysis', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'atomic data', 'atomic interactions', 'computerized tools', 'exhaustion', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'method development', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'reconstruction', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,279675,0.03297030750848285
"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research. Project Narrative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas proteins offer an unprecedented opportunity to precisely manipulate RNA biology in ways not currently possible. We propose several innovative approaches to address critical knowledge gaps in CRISPR-Cas tool development and chart a path to use these tools to interrogate several fundamental questions in RNA biology. Our approaches will help us define the gRNA design rules for RNA-targeting Cas proteins, and develop robust new RNA-targeting Cas tools to manipulate RNA splicing and dissect protein- RNA interaction networks, and ultimately, the tools developed here will transform the way we study RNA and will broadly impact the fields of molecular and cell biology.",Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology,9796943,R35GM133462,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'BCAR1 gene', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Floods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microprocessor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Transcript', 'base', 'clinical application', 'design', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'single cell analysis', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R35,2019,385000,0.0216024345416432
"Computer Simulations of Enzymes Computer simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) and the combined quantum  mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach are capable of describing structures and dynamics  of proteins and chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. An accurate and  computationally efficient energy function is necessary. However, challenges remain: the  accuracy of QM method, the compatibility between the electron density of the QM subsystem and  classical force fields for the MM subsystem, and the cost of ab initio QM/MM methods capitalizing  on the accuracy and reliability of the associated QM approaches. To address these challenges, we  have developed a series of ab initio QM/MM approaches on reaction path optimizations and free  energy calculations, the QM/MM minimum free-energy path (QM/MM-MFEP) and the QM/MM neural  network (QM/MM-NN) methods. This proposal aims to develop further the ab initio QM/MM methodology  and its applications to the studies of redox processes in important enzymes, and the construction  of ab initio force fields combined with neural network representations. Our long-term goals are to develop and establish accurate first-principles based and density  functional theory (DFT) based MD and QM/MM simulation as an equal partner with experiments for the  study of enzymes and proteins and to provide insight into chemical and redox processes in  biological systems. Our aims are as follows: (1) We aim to make ab initio QM/MM models for much  more accurate QM/MM energies, for the QM description and for the electrostatic and vdW interactions   between the QM and MM subsystems. (2) We aim to develop a combined computational  model to explore the key molecular determinants of the reduction potential variability in  metalloproteins. We will provide detailed insight into chemical and redox reaction mechanisms in  biological systems, in particular laccases. (3) We aim at the development of accurate  force fields of water, and proteins for simulations in biological applications, going beyond the  traditional force field forms and limitation in accuracy. The proposed developments will capitalize on the theoretical developments in quantum  electronic theory, such as the linear response theory and accurate many-electron approach for  non-covalent interactions, and leverage machine-learning methods in data science for biological  system simulations. The proposed work will lead to the major advancement of the ab initio QM/MM  method and force fields, and insights into the structure-function paradigm for proteins  and important redox process and reaction mechanisms in enzymes. In addition, it will also lead to  methodology development for design of new drugs and enzyme inhibitors. Understanding chemical reactions and redox processes in solution and in enzymes is of critical  importance, because the structure-function relationship and the catalytic role of enzymes  are fundamental insights in biochemical research, and they are essential for the development of  new or better inhibitors and enzymes. Quantitative tools such as simulations make key contributions  to the investigation of the structure-function relationship, complementing experimental studies.  This proposal aims at developing methods for simulating structures and dynamics in proteins, and  chemical and redox processes catalyzed by enzymes, and investigating the mechanisms of  important enzymes-copper protein laccases, leading to significant advances in research tools for  studying enzymes and contributing to the understanding of life processes, as well as aiding in the  design of inhibitors and drugs.",Computer Simulations of Enzymes,9818963,R01GM061870,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biophysical Process', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copper', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laccase', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metalloproteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Potential Energy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical reaction', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'electron density', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'intermolecular interaction', 'learning strategy', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'neural network', 'novel therapeutics', 'perturbation theory', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,341716,0.0007687507467733139
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems.

"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes Project Summary RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures.

For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9753272,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'human disease', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2019,618108,0.07181469360791128
"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Although MDS is used as the prototype of disease for this proposal, the system developed will be applicable to multiple diseases with complex phenotypes.",Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions,9751927,R01GM123037,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'gene function', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'learning network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2019,302225,0.022118619735450425
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9597237,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web server', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,343124,0.04293837951993473
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9759968,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,321795,0.02073662016300993
"Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes Despite rapid progress in structural bioinformatics, a rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical framework is missing in our current toolbox for analysis, classification, and organization of individual as well as groups of biomolecules. We have recently developed such a framework based on the elastic shape analysis (ESA) for the comparison of protein and RNA structures. Under this framework, the formal geodesic distance for any two protein/RNA structures can be computed rapidly. Probability distributions can also be built for families of protein/RNA structures, and can be used to classify structures in a principled way through statistical hypothesis testing. In addition, sequence information can be naturally incorporated so that comparison of structures can be conducted in the joint sequence-structure space. We have also developed novel algorithms for matching and analyzing protein surfaces. We propose to significantly further develop these methodologies for important applications in structure biology, including studying chromosome structures by combining both 30 structure and sequence level information. The proposed research will make significant contributions to the following areas: (1) This proposal will fill an important gap in structure biology - the lack of a rigorous mathematical and statistical framework for biomolecular structure comparison; (2) Our proposed unifying framework will allow natural incorporation of sequence information for structure comparison; (3) Our approach can uncover distinct clusters at the deepest level of current classification scheme (i.e. SCOP family), enabling a finer classification of biomolecular structures. Preliminary results indicate that by using carefully measured structural similarity, we will obtain representative sets of proteins of higher quality than those by current sequence similarity based methods; (4) The probabilistic models designed for protein/RNA backbone structures and surfaces will capture the flexible nature of protein structures through the use of ensemble of conformations, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These models will also enable effective characterization of family-specific variations among proteins, an important task none of the existing methods work well; (5) Protein/RNA structures will be organized using network-based data structures using probabilistic approaches. This new organization will effectively integrates sequence, backbone structure, and surface information, facilitating discovery of novel insight; and (6) these new development will be rapidly generalized for studying chromosome structures. This proposed research will allow development of tools that will also be applicable in other areas of shape analysis, including medical image analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Our work will help to increase the communication between the field of protein structure analysis and the field of shape analysis, and will stimulate more cross-over development in methodology and transform research activities in both fields. Analysis, classification and organization of biomolecules are fundamental tasks essential for understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships of biomolecules. In this project, we aim to develop rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical frameworks for such tasks and apply them to study proteins, RNAs and chromosomes.",Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes,9731563,R01GM126558,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family Planning', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Grain', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'database structure', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'genome annotation', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'protein distribution', 'protein structure', 'shape analysis', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool development']",NIGMS,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,308756,0.07994878469042897
"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks. The capacity to make such connections will accelerate new compound discovery as well as create associations between gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, and aid in fast and accurate structure elucidations. Combined with this informatics approach, this proposed continuation project explores innovative methods by which to solve complex molecular structures by enhanced MS and NMR experiments, as well as the development of new algorithms by which to accelerate their analysis. Thus, the overarching goal of this grant is to develop efficient methods that facilitate automated structural classification, structural feature discovery and ultimately efficient structure elucidation of natural products (or any small molecule) and to build an infrastructure that interacts with data input from the community. We will achieve this with the following four specific aims: Aim 1. Integration of MS2 molecular networking with gene cluster networking to rapidly and efficiently locate natural products that have unique molecular architectures; Aim 2. To develop a suite of high sensitivity pulse sequences for natural product structure elucidation; Aim 3. To develop NMR based molecular networking strategies using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to facilitate the categorization and structure elucidation of organic compounds; Aim 4. To integrate NMR molecular networking and MS2-based molecular networking as an efficient structure characterization and elucidation strategy. By achieving these aims we will develop an innovative workflow for finding new compounds and for determining their structures, both quickly and accurately. The connection between gene cluster and molecule will shed light on stereochemistry and potential halogenations and methylations. This information can then be used in combination with more efficient NMR and MS methods to accurately determine structures. These tools will be widely shared, such as through the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Network, to enhance the overall capacity of the natural products and organic chemistry communities to solve complex molecular structures.   Natural products are compounds produced by natural sources and about 50 % of FDA approved drugs can trace their origin back to natural products. This proposal aims to use our data set of natural products produced by cyanobacteria for development of analytical tools that will speed- up and stream-line the discovery and structure elucidation of new compounds.  ",Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products,9690083,R01GM107550,"['Algae', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Light', 'Marines', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'analog', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genome sequencing', 'halogenation', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'social', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,530377,0.044637501226003504
"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame. We propose to develop a new physics-based computational accelerator for Molecular Dynamics, called MELD, which incorporates many types of relevant external information that was too vague and difficult to compute to have been practically useful before.",MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference,9618886,R01GM125813,"['Affinity', 'Alanine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blind', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'peptide structure', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'scale up', 'simulation']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2019,317007,0.004750403392559865
"High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy, and are sensitive both to the functional groups that are present and to their detailed geometries and chemical environment. As such these NMR measurements could be used to develop protein structures with a quality equivalent to high resolution X-ray crystallography but in their native aqueous environments. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this proposal, we will develop a new, first principles quantum mechanical (QM) based approach to simulation of NMR spectral observables for condensed phase biomolecules and bio-organics. Rapid prototyping of new QM methods will be enabled by the development of a distinctive in-silico NMR laboratory that applies finite magnetic fields and nuclear spins. From this capability, new methods for chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings will emerge that offer improved accuracy versus cost tradeoffs, and will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein relevant and energetically accessible environments. With such data, both artificial neural networks and Bayesian supervised learning approaches will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting eQMCalculator will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and creation of structural ensembles for IDPs. Project Title: High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This proposal aims to significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or IDP ensemble of structures, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,9633923,U01GM121667,"['Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Phase', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantum Theory', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Solvents', 'Statistical Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'aqueous', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cost', 'database structure', 'drug structure', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic field', 'personalized approach', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'response', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2019,294912,0.03249682286708858
"Integrated Prediction and Validation of Protein Structures ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of three-dimensional protein structure is indispensable in biomedical research. Protein structure and function are intimately linked, and thus structure facilitates drug discovery, aids investigations of protein-protein interactions, informs mutagenesis analysis, guides protein engineering and the design of new proteins, and provides a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of disease. However, the number of protein sequences available in the genomic era far exceeds the capacity of the main experimental structure determination techniques of X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, resulting in a substantial sequence- structure gap. We address this ever-widening gap by developing and disseminating novel protein structure modeling tools. This renewal project is a new collaboration between experts in computational modeling (Cheng) and experimental structural biology (Tanner). We plan to develop innovative, integrated machine learning (e.g., deep learning), data mining and statistical modeling methods to address major challenges in both template-based structure modeling and template-free (ab initio) structure modeling. We will apply these tools to enzymes in the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, a group of enzymes that are involved in numerous important biological processes and implicated in many diseases due to mutations. The ALDH models will be experimentally validated using X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays. Furthermore, we will combine the modeling power of our structural Input-Output hidden Markov model with experimental small- angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to predict the tertiary structures of large multi-domain proteins. The integration of computational and experimental sciences in this project positions us uniquely in structure modeling space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Three-dimensional protein structure information is indispensable in modern biomedical research. However, gene sequencing technology has far exceeded the capacity of experimental protein structure determination methods, giving rise to an ever-widening sequence-structure gap.

"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease. Project Narrative This project develops computational tools for accurately determining protein structure from low- resolution experimental data.

"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,9543037,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2018,310328,0.020428578078657084
"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9535392,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'human disease', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2018,552994,0.07181469360791128
"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Although MDS is used as the prototype of disease for this proposal, the system developed will be applicable to multiple diseases with complex phenotypes.",Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions,9565604,R01GM123037,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'gene function', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'learning network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,302225,0.022118619735450425
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9382895,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2018,329119,0.04293837951993473
"Computational Design of Crystal Lattice Interactions to Determine Recalcitrant Protein Structures PROJECT SUMMARY Proteins are macromolecules that carry out innumerable biological functions ranging from intracellular signaling to immune response. The specific function of a protein is determined by its three-dimensional structure. Therefore, an essential step towards understanding protein function is elucidating protein structure. However, the premier method for structure determination, X-ray crystallography, can be limited by many potential factors including the quality of the protein crystal. The proposed research will investigate the effects of protein– protein interactions in the crystal lattice on crystal quality and resolution and develop a design approach to stabilize lattice interactions, which should result in higher-quality crystals.  First, the molecular determinants of high-quality protein crystal structures will be identified by (1) curating a set of representative structures from the Protein Data Bank, (2) extracting relevant features, such as interaction energy, buried solvent accessible surface area, interfacial packing quality, and residue usage, and (3) analyzing the features’ relationship to crystal resolution (a proxy for quality). Based on these findings, a design strategy and score function for ranking designs within the Rosetta framework will be developed.  Second, the design strategy will be applied to SNase, a model protein that is easy to purify and well- behaved in crystallization and diffraction experiments. The designed proteins will be crystallized and the crystal structures will be solved, testing for improved resolution. Analysis of the resultant crystal structures will drive development of the design strategy.  Third, the design strategy will be applied on a bacterial gyrase, an antibiotic-target protein for which there are several drug-bound structures at low resolution, lacking sufficient detail to reveal key antibiotic– gyrase interactions. Preliminary data suggests that the designed gyrase mutants will yield high-resolution structures, permitting a better understanding of antibiotic–gyrase interactions, with implications for drug design.  Should the method be successful, it will be immediately applicable to ~26,000 structures in the Protein Data Bank, and countless structures that have not been published due to lack of resolution. Re-engineered, high-resolution structures of these proteins could yield structural data on molecular interactions pertinent to disease, drug development, and basic understanding of protein function. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop methods to improve low-resolution crystal structures of proteins to high-resolution sufficient (1) to resolve key mechanistic features of enzyme function and disease, and (2) to design or screen drug molecules.

"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9595902,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,321985,0.02073662016300993
"Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes Despite rapid progress in structural bioinformatics, a rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical framework is missing in our current toolbox for analysis, classification, and organization of individual as well as groups of biomolecules. We have recently developed such a framework based on the elastic shape analysis (ESA) for the comparison of protein and RNA structures. Under this framework, the formal geodesic distance for any two protein/RNA structures can be computed rapidly. Probability distributions can also be built for families of protein/RNA structures, and can be used to classify structures in a principled way through statistical hypothesis testing. In addition, sequence information can be naturally incorporated so that comparison of structures can be conducted in the joint sequence-structure space. We have also developed novel algorithms for matching and analyzing protein surfaces. We propose to significantly further develop these methodologies for important applications in structure biology, including studying chromosome structures by combining both 30 structure and sequence level information. The proposed research will make significant contributions to the following areas: (1) This proposal will fill an important gap in structure biology - the lack of a rigorous mathematical and statistical framework for biomolecular structure comparison; (2) Our proposed unifying framework will allow natural incorporation of sequence information for structure comparison; (3) Our approach can uncover distinct clusters at the deepest level of current classification scheme (i.e. SCOP family), enabling a finer classification of biomolecular structures. Preliminary results indicate that by using carefully measured structural similarity, we will obtain representative sets of proteins of higher quality than those by current sequence similarity based methods; (4) The probabilistic models designed for protein/RNA backbone structures and surfaces will capture the flexible nature of protein structures through the use of ensemble of conformations, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These models will also enable effective characterization of family-specific variations among proteins, an important task none of the existing methods work well; (5) Protein/RNA structures will be organized using network-based data structures using probabilistic approaches. This new organization will effectively integrates sequence, backbone structure, and surface information, facilitating discovery of novel insight; and (6) these new development will be rapidly generalized for studying chromosome structures. This proposed research will allow development of tools that will also be applicable in other areas of shape analysis, including medical image analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition.

"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways.

"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame. We propose to develop a new physics-based computational accelerator for Molecular Dynamics, called MELD, which incorporates many types of relevant external information that was too vague and difficult to compute to have been practically useful before.",MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference,9422220,R01GM125813,"['Affinity', 'Alanine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blind', 'computer based statistical methods', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'peptide structure', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'scale up', 'simulation']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2018,316515,0.004750403392559865
"Integrated Prediction and Validation of Protein Structures ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of three-dimensional protein structure is indispensable in biomedical research. Protein structure and function are intimately linked, and thus structure facilitates drug discovery, aids investigations of protein-protein interactions, informs mutagenesis analysis, guides protein engineering and the design of new proteins, and provides a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of disease. However, the number of protein sequences available in the genomic era far exceeds the capacity of the main experimental structure determination techniques of X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, resulting in a substantial sequence- structure gap. We address this ever-widening gap by developing and disseminating novel protein structure modeling tools. This renewal project is a new collaboration between experts in computational modeling (Cheng) and experimental structural biology (Tanner). We plan to develop innovative, integrated machine learning (e.g., deep learning), data mining and statistical modeling methods to address major challenges in both template-based structure modeling and template-free (ab initio) structure modeling. We will apply these tools to enzymes in the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, a group of enzymes that are involved in numerous important biological processes and implicated in many diseases due to mutations. The ALDH models will be experimentally validated using X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays. Furthermore, we will combine the modeling power of our structural Input-Output hidden Markov model with experimental small- angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to predict the tertiary structures of large multi-domain proteins. The integration of computational and experimental sciences in this project positions us uniquely in structure modeling space.

"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease. Project Narrative This project develops computational tools for accurately determining protein structure from low- resolution experimental data.

"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9320692,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2017,552994,0.07181469360791128
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9233159,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2017,329119,0.04293837951993473
"Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes Despite rapid progress in structural bioinformatics, a rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical framework is missing in our current toolbox for analysis, classification, and organization of individual as well as groups of biomolecules. We have recently developed such a framework based on the elastic shape analysis (ESA) for the comparison of protein and RNA structures. Under this framework, the formal geodesic distance for any two protein/RNA structures can be computed rapidly. Probability distributions can also be built for families of protein/RNA structures, and can be used to classify structures in a principled way through statistical hypothesis testing. In addition, sequence information can be naturally incorporated so that comparison of structures can be conducted in the joint sequence-structure space. We have also developed novel algorithms for matching and analyzing protein surfaces. We propose to significantly further develop these methodologies for important applications in structure biology, including studying chromosome structures by combining both 30 structure and sequence level information. The proposed research will make significant contributions to the following areas: (1) This proposal will fill an important gap in structure biology - the lack of a rigorous mathematical and statistical framework for biomolecular structure comparison; (2) Our proposed unifying framework will allow natural incorporation of sequence information for structure comparison; (3) Our approach can uncover distinct clusters at the deepest level of current classification scheme (i.e. SCOP family), enabling a finer classification of biomolecular structures. Preliminary results indicate that by using carefully measured structural similarity, we will obtain representative sets of proteins of higher quality than those by current sequence similarity based methods; (4) The probabilistic models designed for protein/RNA backbone structures and surfaces will capture the flexible nature of protein structures through the use of ensemble of conformations, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These models will also enable effective characterization of family-specific variations among proteins, an important task none of the existing methods work well; (5) Protein/RNA structures will be organized using network-based data structures using probabilistic approaches. This new organization will effectively integrates sequence, backbone structure, and surface information, facilitating discovery of novel insight; and (6) these new development will be rapidly generalized for studying chromosome structures. This proposed research will allow development of tools that will also be applicable in other areas of shape analysis, including medical image analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition.

"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Although MDS is used as the prototype of disease for this proposal, the system developed will be applicable to multiple diseases with complex phenotypes.",Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions,9288292,R01GM123037,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'gene function', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'learning network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,302225,0.022118619735450425

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules. We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique. Our first objective is to develop a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates secondary structure using double-stranded or single-stranded RNA sequencing. We will also develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features from RNA-seq experiments.

"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.        ","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9070289,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'human disease', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2016,377807,0.07181469360791128
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature.

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules. We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique. Our first objective is to develop a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates secondary structure using double-stranded or single-stranded RNA sequencing.

"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Improving Modeling by Learning from Details of High Accuracy Protein Structures DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The functions of proteins depend exquisitely on their structure, with details at the 0.1 � scale influencing enzyme catalysis, disease-causing mutations, and drug recognition. For this reason, having detailed and accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and the NIH funded the Protein Structure Initiative with the goal of obtaining models for every protein structure with an accuracy approaching that of a high-resolution crystal structure. Current technology for template-based modeling is powerful, but cannot yet deliver ""near-crystal-structure"" quality. Tests show that the best minimization routines still fall short of consistently producing protein models for close homologs that approach within ~1 � rmsd of the 'native' structure as ultimately revealed by crystal structures. To help break through this 1 � barrier, during the previous period of support we used ultrahigh-resolution structures to create a library of conformation- dependent ideal geometry functions for the protein backbone, and showed that its use improves the quality of protein crystal structures and holds promise to improve template-based model refinement. We also discovered that ultrahigh-resolution crystal structures are a rich source of details about protein structure that are not accurately attainable from structures in the ~1.5-2 � resolution range and thus have not yet been fully accounted for in current energy functions. Here, our central hypothesis is that a major step forward in template-based modeling accuracy will come from identifying and explicitly taking into account detailed features of protein covalent geometry, conformation and non-covalent packing interactions that have not yet been characterized, and can now be gleaned from the study of highly accurate ultrahigh-resolution protein structures. The overall goal of our proposal is to mine such information so it can be used to improve the accuracy of predictive modeling. With many ultrahigh-resolution structures now available, the time is ripe to achieve this goal by pursuing three specific aims related to (1) extending the impact of the 'ideal geometry function' paradigm by creating, optimizing, and implementing conformation- dependent libraries accounting for peptide planarity, side chains, and cis-peptides, (2) mining ultrahigh- resolution crystal structures to glean information for next-generation empirical energy functions, and (3) analyzing ultrahigh-resolution protein structures solved in varying environments to produce a set of benchmark test cases and developing residue level assessment tools to use with these test cases to evaluate and hone template-based modeling refinement applications. This proposed work is low cost and low risk, and has a high likelihood of substantial impact as it provides basic information that can be widely incorporated into predictive and experimental modeling applications to improve their accuracy. It is also distinct from major efforts being invested into template-based modeling. Introducing this greater level of realism is a prerequisite to improving the refinement step of template-based modeling and achieving the goals of the Protein Structure Initiative. Proteins carry out the work that gets done inside of cells, so figuring out what they look like helps us understand things like how drugs work and how to design new drugs that will work even better. It is not practical to experimentally determine every protein structure, so having reliable ways to use computers to predict their structures is quite important.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.        The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.        The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules.           We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique. Our first objective is to develop a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates secondary structure using double-stranded or single-stranded RNA sequencing.

"Improving Modeling by Learning from Details of High Accuracy Protein Structures     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The functions of proteins depend exquisitely on their structure, with details at the 0.1 ¿ scale influencing enzyme catalysis, disease-causing mutations, and drug recognition. For this reason, having detailed and accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and the NIH funded the Protein Structure Initiative with the goal of obtaining models for every protein structure with an accuracy approaching that of a high-resolution crystal structure. Current technology for template-based modeling is powerful, but cannot yet deliver ""near-crystal-structure"" quality. Tests show that the best minimization routines still fall short of consistently producing protein models for close homologs that approach within ~1 ¿ rmsd of the 'native' structure as ultimately revealed by crystal structures. To help break through this 1 ¿ barrier, during the previous period of support we used ultrahigh-resolution structures to create a library of conformation- dependent ideal geometry functions for the protein backbone, and showed that its use improves the quality of protein crystal structures and holds promise to improve template-based model refinement. We also discovered that ultrahigh-resolution crystal structures are a rich source of details about protein structure that are not accurately attainable from structures in the ~1.5-2 ¿ resolution range and thus have not yet been fully accounted for in current energy functions. Here, our central hypothesis is that a major step forward in template-based modeling accuracy will come from identifying and explicitly taking into account detailed features of protein covalent geometry, conformation and non-covalent packing interactions that have not yet been characterized, and can now be gleaned from the study of highly accurate ultrahigh-resolution protein structures. The overall goal of our proposal is to mine such information so it can be used to improve the accuracy of predictive modeling. With many ultrahigh-resolution structures now available, the time is ripe to achieve this goal by pursuing three specific aims related to (1) extending the impact of the 'ideal geometry function' paradigm by creating, optimizing, and implementing conformation- dependent libraries accounting for peptide planarity, side chains, and cis-peptides, (2) mining ultrahigh- resolution crystal structures to glean information for next-generation empirical energy functions, and (3) analyzing ultrahigh-resolution protein structures solved in varying environments to produce a set of benchmark test cases and developing residue level assessment tools to use with these test cases to evaluate and hone template-based modeling refinement applications. This proposed work is low cost and low risk, and has a high likelihood of substantial impact as it provides basic information that can be widely incorporated into predictive and experimental modeling applications to improve their accuracy. It is also distinct from major efforts being invested into template-based modeling. Introducing this greater level of realism is a prerequisite to improving the refinement step of template-based modeling and achieving the goals of the Protein Structure Initiative.           Proteins carry out the work that gets done inside of cells, so figuring out what they look like helps us understand things like how drugs work and how to design new drugs that will work even better. It is not practical to experimentally determine every protein structure, so having reliable ways to use computers to predict their structures is quite important. Current methods are not quite accurate enough, and the goal of this work is to look carefully at the best known protein structures to learn from their exact features how we can improve prediction technology to get the details right.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.            Project Narrative The explosion in data related to molecular biology has created great opportunities for new disease diagnostics and therapies.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.             The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes.

"Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A detailed and accurate understanding of the structure of proteins is one cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and an explicit goal of the NIH is to define the structure of all proteins either by accurate experimental determination or comparative model-building. The most successful structure prediction approaches employ empirical knowledge-based energy terms derived from features of known protein structures - most notably single-residue ???-distributions, backbone-dependent side chain rotamer preferences, and tight packing criteria. One known unrealistic feature of these prediction programs is the assumption of a fixed ideal geometry for the backbone. The driving hypothesis behind this proposal is that there exists a largely unappreciated but real, systematic, significant and pervasive variation in backbone bond angles and peptide planarity that occurs as a function of backbone torsion angles, and accounting properly for this variation will be required to achieve X-ray crystal structure quality for comparative models. The overall goal of this work is to generate accurate empirical values for this covalent variation that will lead to tangible improvements in the accuracy of structures produced by comparative modeling and de novo structure prediction as well as by X-ray crystallography. We propose to achieve this overall goal by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) to design, develop, and make available a flexibly-searchable database containing bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles for all structures known at better than 1.75 ¿ resolution (currently ~500,000 residues); 2) to use conventional query-based and modern machine learning approaches to derive accurate empirical information from the database about the systematic correlation of local conformation with variations in covalent geometry; and 3) to create a modular conformation-dependent expected covalent geometry library and to facilitate its incorporation into leading applications for comparative and crystallographic protein structure modeling. With the dramatically increased number of ultrahigh-resolution resolution crystal structures now known, the time is ripe for construction of this Protein Geometry Database that will provide facile access to a massive treasure trove of reliable and detailed empirical information about protein structure. To be done well, this work will require painstaking attention to detail and an intimate familiarity with the limitations of crystallographic refinement and the principles of protein structure. Dr. Karplus is well-suited to lead this work as he has a 20+-year track record of quality crystallographic structure determinations combined with contributions of more general insights into protein structure, among them being the pioneering characterization of the conformation-dependent variations in covalent geometry that serves as this project's foundation. Collaborations with world-leading groups in structure prediction, in crystallographic refinement and structure validation, and in knowledge-based library development ensure a rapid and effective translation of the gleaned information into improvements in protein modeling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proteins are responsible for carrying out most of the processes of life and their function depends exquisitely on their structure, even on the tiniest structural details.

"Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A detailed and accurate understanding of the structure of proteins is one cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and an explicit goal of the NIH is to define the structure of all proteins either by accurate experimental determination or comparative model-building. The most successful structure prediction approaches employ empirical knowledge-based energy terms derived from features of known protein structures - most notably single-residue ???-distributions, backbone-dependent side chain rotamer preferences, and tight packing criteria. One known unrealistic feature of these prediction programs is the assumption of a fixed ideal geometry for the backbone. The driving hypothesis behind this proposal is that there exists a largely unappreciated but real, systematic, significant and pervasive variation in backbone bond angles and peptide planarity that occurs as a function of backbone torsion angles, and accounting properly for this variation will be required to achieve X-ray crystal structure quality for comparative models. The overall goal of this work is to generate accurate empirical values for this covalent variation that will lead to tangible improvements in the accuracy of structures produced by comparative modeling and de novo structure prediction as well as by X-ray crystallography. We propose to achieve this overall goal by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) to design, develop, and make available a flexibly-searchable database containing bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles for all structures known at better than 1.75 ¿ resolution (currently ~500,000 residues); 2) to use conventional query-based and modern machine learning approaches to derive accurate empirical information from the database about the systematic correlation of local conformation with variations in covalent geometry; and 3) to create a modular conformation-dependent expected covalent geometry library and to facilitate its incorporation into leading applications for comparative and crystallographic protein structure modeling. With the dramatically increased number of ultrahigh-resolution resolution crystal structures now known, the time is ripe for construction of this Protein Geometry Database that will provide facile access to a massive treasure trove of reliable and detailed empirical information about protein structure. To be done well, this work will require painstaking attention to detail and an intimate familiarity with the limitations of crystallographic refinement and the principles of protein structure. Dr. Karplus is well-suited to lead this work as he has a 20+-year track record of quality crystallographic structure determinations combined with contributions of more general insights into protein structure, among them being the pioneering characterization of the conformation-dependent variations in covalent geometry that serves as this project's foundation. Collaborations with world-leading groups in structure prediction, in crystallographic refinement and structure validation, and in knowledge-based library development ensure a rapid and effective translation of the gleaned information into improvements in protein modeling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proteins are responsible for carrying out most of the processes of life and their function depends exquisitely on their structure, even on the tiniest structural details. For this reason, determining accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research. This work is aimed at leading to a universal improvement in the accuracy with which protein structure can be built.           n/a",Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins,7905142,R01GM083136,"['Accounting', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Crystallography', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Homology Modeling', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'molecular mechanics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics']",NIGMS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,210764,0.060131171334751356
"Optimization of Stuctures and Networks of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application has three major aims that exploit the use of mathematical programming tools for biophysically motivated problems. The first goal is the refinement of protein structures that are obtained from homology. Structures based on homology are rarely of atomic resolution; a resolution which is necessary for detailed modeling of protein function, and for the design of drug molecules. Based on mathematical programming approach a new class of energy functions, suitable for the refinement problem, will be designed. The second goal is to investigate a new type of network; the network of sequence flow between protein structures. We examine the process in which new sequences, generated by point mutations, remain in the current fold, or switch to other stable structures (we exclude sequences with no stable fold). The adjustments to the structure are accepted or rejected based on stability criterion. The net. work defines a master equation which makes it possible to investigate past (ancient) folds, and future structures that serve as attractors. The third aim examines the network of protein-protein (physical) interactions and will be examined with bioinformatics and biophysical approaches. Comparison will be made between the network of sequence flow and the network of protein-protein interactions to better understand the evolution of biological mechanisms and recognition.

"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant. We now seek to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the annotation pipeline by optimizing the definition of 3-D templates, by adding new template features to better judge whether molecular mimicry underlies functional similarity; and by developing novel strategies that use multiple templates to identify function. The result will reveal which regions of proteins are most biologically relevant, and hence logical targets for protein engineering and drug design, and it will extend to three dimensions a functional annotation strategy traditionally based on one- dimensional pattern matching in protein sequences. In so doing, this work addresses a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in ""post-genomic biology"": linking massive and exponentially growing amounts of raw sequence and structure data to the molecular basis of biological function.           n/a",Comparative genomics of protein structure and function,7786185,R01GM079656,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzymes', 'Failure', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PAWR protein', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Solvents', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative genomics', 'computer studies', 'conformer', 'database structure', 'design', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'heuristics', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2010,278531,0.02059222797450408
"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.

"Machine Learning and Visualization in Structural Biology    DESCRIPTION:       This project's main objective is to develop computerized tools that assist x-ray crystallographers in rapidly determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein. More specifically, this project addresses the following task: given a 3D electron-density map from crystallography and the sequence of the protein, find the most likely layout (i.e. ""trace"") of the protein sequence in 3D. The project will create both automated methods based on statistical machine-learning and computer-vision techniques, as well as visualization tools that support humans doing this layout. These two approaches complement each other and are synergistic.      This project's first specific aim is to develop and empirically evaluate algorithms that interpret crystallographic electron-density maps. The second specific aim is to incorporate structural-biology domain knowledge (secondary-structure prediction and potential-energy calculations) into the project's algorithms for interpreting density maps. The third specific aim is to tightly integrate partial model-construction with phase estimation updates to improve the recognition of 3D protein structures in x-ray reflection data; crystallographers will be able to intervene whenever they desire to help ""steer"" this iterative process. The final specific aim is to develop intuitive and effective modalities - including virtual reality and the use of speech/audio - for the efficient use of crystallographer's time in manual model fitting and validation.      Structural biology has wide relevance to biomedicine, since protein function generally follows from protein form (i.e., its structure). This project's techniques will speed-up the process of determining protein 3D structures, especially from low-quality (i.e., low-resolution) x-ray data, and will be applicable to other structural-biology tasks.

"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases.

"Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics By Virtual High-Throughput Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier.      A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilts NIH-funded molecular libraries screening center network facility revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances whose activity was validated in independent experiments. The present ChemInformatics proposal targets utilizing the power of recent machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to model the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators reflected in the HTS results. An innovative encoding scheme is developed that allows mapping of the diverse chemical space into a single mathematical model. The resulting Quantitative Structure Activity Relation (QSAR) models will serve a three-fold purpose: (a) a comprehensive binding site pharmacophore will be obtained to facilitate understanding of the SAR and rationalize further experiments; (b) the models will be used to virtually screen libraries of millions of compounds which are known but not physically available for HTS at Vanderbilt to gain a priority list for acquisition or synthesis; and (c) in combination with an existing Genetic Algorithm (GA) structure generator existing lead compounds will be optimized and new structures will be designed to identify potential new targets for synthesis.      Overall we hope to not only identify novel allosteric potentiators of mGluR5 and understand their activity as potential treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function, but also to build an innovative ChemInformatics software and database tool which can be adopted for research in other NIH molecular libraries screening centers. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research using a WWW interface deeply integrated in the drug development pipeline. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target protein. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      The PI of the proposal has extensive experience in the usage of ANNs and SVMs to predict properties of organic molecules and proteins (1-9), solve protein structures (10-15), and predict activity of therapeutics (16). He implemented GAs for the design and optimization of chemical structures (17,18). For the tasks at hand he teams up with Jeff Conn, a renowned expert for researching mGluRs (19) and potential therapeutics targeting these systems (20-22).          n/a",Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics By Virtual High-Throughput Screening,7544499,R21MH082254,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Half-Life', 'Hand', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical synthesis', 'cheminformatics', 'cognitive function', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'experience', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'virtual']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,164425,0.030135392367277032
"Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A detailed and accurate understanding of the structure of proteins is one cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and an explicit goal of the NIH is to define the structure of all proteins either by accurate experimental determination or comparative model-building. The most successful structure prediction approaches employ empirical knowledge-based energy terms derived from features of known protein structures - most notably single-residue ???-distributions, backbone-dependent side chain rotamer preferences, and tight packing criteria. One known unrealistic feature of these prediction programs is the assumption of a fixed ideal geometry for the backbone. The driving hypothesis behind this proposal is that there exists a largely unappreciated but real, systematic, significant and pervasive variation in backbone bond angles and peptide planarity that occurs as a function of backbone torsion angles, and accounting properly for this variation will be required to achieve X-ray crystal structure quality for comparative models. The overall goal of this work is to generate accurate empirical values for this covalent variation that will lead to tangible improvements in the accuracy of structures produced by comparative modeling and de novo structure prediction as well as by X-ray crystallography. We propose to achieve this overall goal by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) to design, develop, and make available a flexibly-searchable database containing bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles for all structures known at better than 1.75 ¿ resolution (currently ~500,000 residues); 2) to use conventional query-based and modern machine learning approaches to derive accurate empirical information from the database about the systematic correlation of local conformation with variations in covalent geometry; and 3) to create a modular conformation-dependent expected covalent geometry library and to facilitate its incorporation into leading applications for comparative and crystallographic protein structure modeling. With the dramatically increased number of ultrahigh-resolution resolution crystal structures now known, the time is ripe for construction of this Protein Geometry Database that will provide facile access to a massive treasure trove of reliable and detailed empirical information about protein structure. To be done well, this work will require painstaking attention to detail and an intimate familiarity with the limitations of crystallographic refinement and the principles of protein structure. Dr. Karplus is well-suited to lead this work as he has a 20+-year track record of quality crystallographic structure determinations combined with contributions of more general insights into protein structure, among them being the pioneering characterization of the conformation-dependent variations in covalent geometry that serves as this project's foundation. Collaborations with world-leading groups in structure prediction, in crystallographic refinement and structure validation, and in knowledge-based library development ensure a rapid and effective translation of the gleaned information into improvements in protein modeling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proteins are responsible for carrying out most of the processes of life and their function depends exquisitely on their structure, even on the tiniest structural details. For this reason, determining accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research. This work is aimed at leading to a universal improvement in the accuracy with which protein structure can be built.           n/a",Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins,7656854,R01GM083136,"['Accounting', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalysis', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Crystallography', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Homology Modeling', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'molecular mechanics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics']",NIGMS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,286440,0.060131171334751356
"Optimization of Stuctures and Networks of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application has three major aims that exploit the use of mathematical programming tools for biophysically motivated problems. The first goal is the refinement of protein structures that are obtained from homology. Structures based on homology are rarely of atomic resolution; a resolution which is necessary for detailed modeling of protein function, and for the design of drug molecules. Based on mathematical programming approach a new class of energy functions, suitable for the refinement problem, will be designed. The second goal is to investigate a new type of network; the network of sequence flow between protein structures. We examine the process in which new sequences, generated by point mutations, remain in the current fold, or switch to other stable structures (we exclude sequences with no stable fold). The adjustments to the structure are accepted or rejected based on stability criterion. The net. work defines a master equation which makes it possible to investigate past (ancient) folds, and future structures that serve as attractors. The third aim examines the network of protein-protein (physical) interactions and will be examined with bioinformatics and biophysical approaches. Comparison will be made between the network of sequence flow and the network of protein-protein interactions to better understand the evolution of biological mechanisms and recognition.

"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant. We now seek to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the annotation pipeline by optimizing the definition of 3-D templates, by adding new template features to better judge whether molecular mimicry underlies functional similarity; and by developing novel strategies that use multiple templates to identify function. The result will reveal which regions of proteins are most biologically relevant, and hence logical targets for protein engineering and drug design, and it will extend to three dimensions a functional annotation strategy traditionally based on one- dimensional pattern matching in protein sequences. In so doing, this work addresses a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in ""post-genomic biology"": linking massive and exponentially growing amounts of raw sequence and structure data to the molecular basis of biological function.           n/a",Comparative genomics of protein structure and function,7586248,R01GM079656,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzymes', 'Failure', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PAWR protein', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Solvents', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'conformer', 'database structure', 'design', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'heuristics', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2009,281344,0.02059222797450408
"Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions: Computational Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cocaine inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters is responsible for the addictive properties of this potent illicit compound. A molecular model of the cocaine neurotransmitter transporter complex would promote understanding of the addictive nature of cocaine and accelerate development of therapeutics for psychiatric treatment of cocaine addiction. Recent developments in the neurotransmitter transporter field present a unique opportunity to develop an accurate model of cocaine interactions with neurotransmitter transporters. The recent report of a high-resolution crystal structure of a leucine transporter, the first member in the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family of proteins, enables reliable structural interpretation of functional data for human dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters. This structure, combined with the currently available sequences for the NSS family and the datasets for cocaine-derived inhibitors of serotonin and dopamine transporters, give the means to create an accurate model for cocaine neurotransmitter transporter interactions. This project takes a two-pronged approach to modeling the cocaine neurotransmitter complexes. First, evolutionary conserved structural and functional constraints evolutionary will be extracted using ""evolutionary trace"" and ""statistical coupling analysis"" methods on available neurotransmitter transporter sequences. This will identify networks of residues responsible for the diverse functionalities observed in neurotransmitter transporters. Second, protein computational modeling techniques will be used to build comparative models off the leucine transporter structure, and then to predict modes of interaction for cocaine and cocaine analogs. The models can then be filtered and refined based on available biological data. Out of this project, the resulting atomic resolution models of cocaine and its analogs bound to dopamine and serotonin transporter will explain and predict the efficacy of new therapeutics for treatment of cocaine addiction. In short, the molecular models of cocaine bound to serotonin or dopamine transporter would provide a critical advancement for investigating and understanding cocaine and its neuro-chemical effects.            n/a",Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions: Computational Studies,7658677,F31DA024528,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Chemicals', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Leucine', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sodium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substance of Abuse', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analog', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'design', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'serotonin transporter', 'small molecule', 'symporter', 'therapeutic development', 'tool']",NIDA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,28202,0.007074569089641075
"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,7477279,R01LM005652,"['Active Sites', 'Algorithms', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Growth', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Seeds', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'indexing', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'size', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'technology development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vector']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,338976,0.06879820836193816
"Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics By Virtual High-Throughput Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier.      A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilts NIH-funded molecular libraries screening center network facility revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances whose activity was validated in independent experiments. The present ChemInformatics proposal targets utilizing the power of recent machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to model the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators reflected in the HTS results. An innovative encoding scheme is developed that allows mapping of the diverse chemical space into a single mathematical model. The resulting Quantitative Structure Activity Relation (QSAR) models will serve a three-fold purpose: (a) a comprehensive binding site pharmacophore will be obtained to facilitate understanding of the SAR and rationalize further experiments; (b) the models will be used to virtually screen libraries of millions of compounds which are known but not physically available for HTS at Vanderbilt to gain a priority list for acquisition or synthesis; and (c) in combination with an existing Genetic Algorithm (GA) structure generator existing lead compounds will be optimized and new structures will be designed to identify potential new targets for synthesis.      Overall we hope to not only identify novel allosteric potentiators of mGluR5 and understand their activity as potential treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function, but also to build an innovative ChemInformatics software and database tool which can be adopted for research in other NIH molecular libraries screening centers. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research using a WWW interface deeply integrated in the drug development pipeline. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target protein. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      The PI of the proposal has extensive experience in the usage of ANNs and SVMs to predict properties of organic molecules and proteins (1-9), solve protein structures (10-15), and predict activity of therapeutics (16). He implemented GAs for the design and optimization of chemical structures (17,18).

"Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A detailed and accurate understanding of the structure of proteins is one cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and an explicit goal of the NIH is to define the structure of all proteins either by accurate experimental determination or comparative model-building. The most successful structure prediction approaches employ empirical knowledge-based energy terms derived from features of known protein structures - most notably single-residue ???-distributions, backbone-dependent side chain rotamer preferences, and tight packing criteria. One known unrealistic feature of these prediction programs is the assumption of a fixed ideal geometry for the backbone. The driving hypothesis behind this proposal is that there exists a largely unappreciated but real, systematic, significant and pervasive variation in backbone bond angles and peptide planarity that occurs as a function of backbone torsion angles, and accounting properly for this variation will be required to achieve X-ray crystal structure quality for comparative models. The overall goal of this work is to generate accurate empirical values for this covalent variation that will lead to tangible improvements in the accuracy of structures produced by comparative modeling and de novo structure prediction as well as by X-ray crystallography. We propose to achieve this overall goal by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) to design, develop, and make available a flexibly-searchable database containing bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles for all structures known at better than 1.75 ¿ resolution (currently ~500,000 residues); 2) to use conventional query-based and modern machine learning approaches to derive accurate empirical information from the database about the systematic correlation of local conformation with variations in covalent geometry; and 3) to create a modular conformation-dependent expected covalent geometry library and to facilitate its incorporation into leading applications for comparative and crystallographic protein structure modeling. With the dramatically increased number of ultrahigh-resolution resolution crystal structures now known, the time is ripe for construction of this Protein Geometry Database that will provide facile access to a massive treasure trove of reliable and detailed empirical information about protein structure. To be done well, this work will require painstaking attention to detail and an intimate familiarity with the limitations of crystallographic refinement and the principles of protein structure. Dr. Karplus is well-suited to lead this work as he has a 20+-year track record of quality crystallographic structure determinations combined with contributions of more general insights into protein structure, among them being the pioneering characterization of the conformation-dependent variations in covalent geometry that serves as this project's foundation. Collaborations with world-leading groups in structure prediction, in crystallographic refinement and structure validation, and in knowledge-based library development ensure a rapid and effective translation of the gleaned information into improvements in protein modeling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proteins are responsible for carrying out most of the processes of life and their function depends exquisitely on their structure, even on the tiniest structural details. For this reason, determining accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research.

"Optimization of Stuctures and Networks of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application has three major aims that exploit the use of mathematical programming tools for biophysically motivated problems. The first goal is the refinement of protein structures that are obtained from homology. Structures based on homology are rarely of atomic resolution; a resolution which is necessary for detailed modeling of protein function, and for the design of drug molecules. Based on mathematical programming approach a new class of energy functions, suitable for the refinement problem, will be designed. The second goal is to investigate a new type of network; the network of sequence flow between protein structures. We examine the process in which new sequences, generated by point mutations, remain in the current fold, or switch to other stable structures (we exclude sequences with no stable fold). The adjustments to the structure are accepted or rejected based on stability criterion. The net. work defines a master equation which makes it possible to investigate past (ancient) folds, and future structures that serve as attractors. The third aim examines the network of protein-protein (physical) interactions and will be examined with bioinformatics and biophysical approaches. Comparison will be made between the network of sequence flow and the network of protein-protein interactions to better understand the evolution of biological mechanisms and recognition.

"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant. We now seek to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the annotation pipeline by optimizing the definition of 3-D templates, by adding new template features to better judge whether molecular mimicry underlies functional similarity; and by developing novel strategies that use multiple templates to identify function. The result will reveal which regions of proteins are most biologically relevant, and hence logical targets for protein engineering and drug design, and it will extend to three dimensions a functional annotation strategy traditionally based on one- dimensional pattern matching in protein sequences. In so doing, this work addresses a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in ""post-genomic biology"": linking massive and exponentially growing amounts of raw sequence and structure data to the molecular basis of biological function.           n/a",Comparative genomics of protein structure and function,7391818,R01GM079656,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzymes', 'Failure', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Mutation', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'PAWR protein', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pliability', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Solvents', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'conformer', 'design', 'falls', 'heuristics', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2008,281344,0.02059222797450408
"Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions:Computational Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cocaine inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters is responsible for the addictive properties of this potent illicit compound. A molecular model of the cocaine neurotransmitter transporter complex would promote understanding of the addictive nature of cocaine and accelerate development of therapeutics for psychiatric treatment of cocaine addiction. Recent developments in the neurotransmitter transporter field present a unique opportunity to develop an accurate model of cocaine interactions with neurotransmitter transporters. The recent report of a high-resolution crystal structure of a leucine transporter, the first member in the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family of proteins, enables reliable structural interpretation of functional data for human dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters. This structure, combined with the currently available sequences for the NSS family and the datasets for cocaine-derived inhibitors of serotonin and dopamine transporters, give the means to create an accurate model for cocaine neurotransmitter transporter interactions. This project takes a two-pronged approach to modeling the cocaine neurotransmitter complexes. First, evolutionary conserved structural and functional constraints evolutionary will be extracted using ""evolutionary trace"" and ""statistical coupling analysis"" methods on available neurotransmitter transporter sequences. This will identify networks of residues responsible for the diverse functionalities observed in neurotransmitter transporters. Second, protein computational modeling techniques will be used to build comparative models off the leucine transporter structure, and then to predict modes of interaction for cocaine and cocaine analogs. The models can then be filtered and refined based on available biological data. Out of this project, the resulting atomic resolution models of cocaine and its analogs bound to dopamine and serotonin transporter will explain and predict the efficacy of new therapeutics for treatment of cocaine addiction. In short, the molecular models of cocaine bound to serotonin or dopamine transporter would provide a critical advancement for investigating and understanding cocaine and its neuro-chemical effects.            n/a",Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions:Computational Studies,7546079,F31DA024528,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Chemicals', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Leucine', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sodium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substance of Abuse', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'analog', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'concept', 'design', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'serotonin transporter', 'small molecule', 'symporter', 'tool']",NIDA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2008,32027,0.007074569089641075

"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases. This research effort will develop of a novel, efficient, and biologically accurate computational approach to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins.           n/a",Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search,7258945,R01GM076706,"['Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Muscle Rigidity', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Space Explorations', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2007,230753,0.0419484689399642
"Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Determining protein structure and function from genomic sequences and protein classification remains one of the most significant challenges in modern computational biology.  Significant enhancement to the capacity of algorithms to predict protein shapes from sequences is proposed, focusing on major bottlenecks; e.g., the folding energy and the ability of making approximate matches.  Algorithms to determine protein shapes from sequences have two major components: The first component (sampling) generates a set of plausible protein shapes; at least one of the sampled shapes is expected to be similar to the correct fold.  The second component scores the different structures and decides on the best model.  The radius of convergence of the energy function must be sufficiently large so that approximate matches will be detected as well (in threading approximate matches may include deletions and insertion).  It is therefore clear that poor scoring functions (or energies), which are unable to identify the correct fold, are likely to diminish the capacity of the folding algorithm.  At present, it is easy to generate a set of decoy (wrong) structures that will confuse existing energy functions.  Mathematical programming and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines) will design enhanced folding and threading potentials.  The training by these methods is automated and will lead to monotonic improvement in recognition as a function of the data size.

"Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Determining protein structure and function from genomic sequences and protein classification remains one of the most significant challenges in modern computational biology.  Significant enhancement to the capacity of algorithms to predict protein shapes from sequences is proposed, focusing on major bottlenecks; e.g., the folding energy and the ability of making approximate matches.  Algorithms to determine protein shapes from sequences have two major components: The first component (sampling) generates a set of plausible protein shapes; at least one of the sampled shapes is expected to be similar to the correct fold.  The second component scores the different structures and decides on the best model.  The radius of convergence of the energy function must be sufficiently large so that approximate matches will be detected as well (in threading approximate matches may include deletions and insertion).  It is therefore clear that poor scoring functions (or energies), which are unable to identify the correct fold, are likely to diminish the capacity of the folding algorithm.  At present, it is easy to generate a set of decoy (wrong) structures that will confuse existing energy functions.  Mathematical programming and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines) will design enhanced folding and threading potentials.  The training by these methods is automated and will lead to monotonic improvement in recognition as a function of the data size.

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,7282065,R01LM005652,"['Active Sites', 'Algorithms', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Growth', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Seeds', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'indexing', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'size', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'technology development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vector']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,355458,0.06879820836193816
"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant. We now seek to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the annotation pipeline by optimizing the definition of 3-D templates, by adding new template features to better judge whether molecular mimicry underlies functional similarity; and by developing novel strategies that use multiple templates to identify function. The result will reveal which regions of proteins are most biologically relevant, and hence logical targets for protein engineering and drug design, and it will extend to three dimensions a functional annotation strategy traditionally based on one- dimensional pattern matching in protein sequences. In so doing, this work addresses a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in ""post-genomic biology"": linking massive and exponentially growing amounts of raw sequence and structure data to the molecular basis of biological function.           n/a",Comparative genomics of protein structure and function,7192957,R01GM079656,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzymes', 'Failure', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Mutation', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'PAWR protein', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pliability', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Solvents', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'conformer', 'design', 'falls', 'heuristics', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2007,290844,0.02059222797450408
"Machine Learning and Visualization in Structural Biology    DESCRIPTION:       This project's main objective is to develop computerized tools that assist x-ray crystallographers in rapidly determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein. More specifically, this project addresses the following task: given a 3D electron-density map from crystallography and the sequence of the protein, find the most likely layout (i.e. ""trace"") of the protein sequence in 3D. The project will create both automated methods based on statistical machine-learning and computer-vision techniques, as well as visualization tools that support humans doing this layout. These two approaches complement each other and are synergistic.      This project's first specific aim is to develop and empirically evaluate algorithms that interpret crystallographic electron-density maps. The second specific aim is to incorporate structural-biology domain knowledge (secondary-structure prediction and potential-energy calculations) into the project's algorithms for interpreting density maps. The third specific aim is to tightly integrate partial model-construction with phase estimation updates to improve the recognition of 3D protein structures in x-ray reflection data; crystallographers will be able to intervene whenever they desire to help ""steer"" this iterative process. The final specific aim is to develop intuitive and effective modalities - including virtual reality and the use of speech/audio - for the efficient use of crystallographer's time in manual model fitting and validation.      Structural biology has wide relevance to biomedicine, since protein function generally follows from protein form (i.e., its structure). This project's techniques will speed-up the process of determining protein 3D structures, especially from low-quality (i.e., low-resolution) x-ray data, and will be applicable to other structural-biology tasks. Being able to accurately interpret low-resolution data promises to allow higher through put structure determination. The broader impact will include a better understanding of the power of modern theories and algorithms in machine learning and visualization in solving biological problems.         n/a",Machine Learning and Visualization in Structural Biology,6958317,R01LM008796,"['computer human interaction', 'computer simulation', 'computers', 'density', 'electron density', 'human', 'learning', 'model', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure', 'proteins', 'structural biology', 'vision']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,R01,2006,322749,0.012664137651048638
"Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve human health, a goal of the          human genome project is to translate the genome sequence into an understanding       of human biology. An important step in this process is knowledge of the              structure of human proteins and the effects of sequence polymorphisms on             structure and function. Currently, the structures of only 1000 human proteins        are known, but the structures of up to one third or so of human proteins can be      modeled based on the structures of homologous proteins in the Protein Data           Bank. This fraction will increase rapidly due to structural genomics efforts.        Unfortunately, general principles of what works in homology modeling and what        does not have remained elusive. The reasons for this are several: 1)                 insufficient benchmarking of most prediction methods; 2) reliance on                 out-of-date statistical analysis of protein structures, performed without modem      methods of statistics: 3) most modeling methods assume a relatively high level       of sequence identity (>35 percent) between template structure and sequence to        be modeled, when most proteins of unknown structure are only distantly related       to proteins of known structure. The PI proposes benchmarking, new statistical        analysis, and new algorithms for each of the three major aspects of homology         modeling: alignment, building backbone coordinates for insertiondeletion             regions, and sidechain placement. The primary tools will be Bayesian                 statistical analysis, including hierarchical models and non-parametric methods       based on the Dirichlet process. The increase in size of the sequence and             structure databases makes the new statistical analysis timely, both because of       the increased power the new data provide, and the numerous applications              afforded by more sequences and structures.                                                                                                                                n/a",Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling,6990509,R01HG002302,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer simulation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular dynamics', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure function', 'statistics /biometry', 'transposon /insertion element']",NHGRI,INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R01,2006,246078,0.03935134309436428

"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases. This research effort will develop of a novel, efficient, and biologically accurate computational approach to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins.           n/a",Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search,7139225,R01GM076706,"['bioinformatics', 'chemical models', 'chemical structure', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'conformation', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'structural biology', 'three dimensional imaging /topography']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2006,238087,0.0419484689399642

"EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR PROTEIN STRUCTURE PREDICTION The goal of this project is to develop a computer algorithm that accurately predicts the tertiary fold of a protein given only its amino acid sequence and sparse experimental constraints or an imperfect secondary structure prediction. It will use an evolutionary optimization algorithm, a detailed atomic representation, and a proprietary method for deriving a protein energy function. The specific aims of Phase II are: (1) improve the representation of the problem; (2) improve the optimization algorithm; (3) parameterize a more accurate protein energy function; and (4) validate the prototype algorithm and energy function on a large sample of known protein structures and in blind structure prediction experiments. In Phase III the algorithm will be developed into commercial software products for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  The long-term goal is to help satisfy the rapidly growing demand for the accurate prediction of protein structures from sequence information. This demand arises not only from the exponential growth of the database of sequences, but also from the need to understand the structure and function of newly discovered gene products known to be involved in human disease.

Currently, the structures of only 1000 human proteins        are known, but the structures of up to one third or so of human proteins can be      modeled based on the structures of homologous proteins in the Protein Data           Bank. This fraction will increase rapidly due to structural genomics efforts.        Unfortunately, general principles of what works in homology modeling and what        does not have remained elusive. The reasons for this are several: 1)                 insufficient benchmarking of most prediction methods; 2) reliance on                 out-of-date statistical analysis of protein structures, performed without modem      methods of statistics: 3) most modeling methods assume a relatively high level       of sequence identity (>35 percent) between template structure and sequence to        be modeled, when most proteins of unknown structure are only distantly related       to proteins of known structure. The PI proposes benchmarking, new statistical        analysis, and new algorithms for each of the three major aspects of homology         modeling: alignment, building backbone coordinates for insertiondeletion             regions, and sidechain placement. The primary tools will be Bayesian                 statistical analysis, including hierarchical models and non-parametric methods       based on the Dirichlet process. The increase in size of the sequence and             structure databases makes the new statistical analysis timely, both because of       the increased power the new data provide, and the numerous applications              afforded by more sequences and structures.                                                                                                                                n/a",Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling,6683607,R01HG002302,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer simulation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular dynamics', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure function', 'statistics /biometry', 'transposon /insertion element']",NHGRI,INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R01,2004,252000,0.03935134309436428

"Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Determining protein structure and function from genomic sequences and protein classification remains one of the most significant challenges in modern computational biology.  Significant enhancement to the capacity of algorithms to predict protein shapes from sequences is proposed, focusing on major bottlenecks; e.g., the folding energy and the ability of making approximate matches.  Algorithms to determine protein shapes from sequences have two major components: The first component (sampling) generates a set of plausible protein shapes; at least one of the sampled shapes is expected to be similar to the correct fold.  The second component scores the different structures and decides on the best model.  The radius of convergence of the energy function must be sufficiently large so that approximate matches will be detected as well (in threading approximate matches may include deletions and insertion).  It is therefore clear that poor scoring functions (or energies), which are unable to identify the correct fold, are likely to diminish the capacity of the folding algorithm.  At present, it is easy to generate a set of decoy (wrong) structures that will confuse existing energy functions.  Mathematical programming and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines) will design enhanced folding and threading potentials.  The training by these methods is automated and will lead to monotonic improvement in recognition as a function of the data size.  To more effectively cover protein space, the goal is to learn 100 million data points in a single consistent potential with (at most) 10,000 parameters.  The automated large scale learning is crucial at times in which the information on sequences and structures grows rapidly.  A threading prediction server, based on the old and the new potentials, is and will be available, to the community at http://ser-loopp.tc.cornell.edu/Ioopp.html         n/a",Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins,6727166,R01GM067823,"['bioinformatics', 'chemical models', 'computational biology', 'molecular shape', 'protein folding', 'protein sequence']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY ITHACA,R01,2004,261122,0.004958151435312722
"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,6825272,R01LM005652,"['active sites', 'binding sites', 'computer simulation', 'macromolecule', 'model design /development', 'physical model', 'structural biology']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,396367,0.06879820836193816
"NMR TECHNOLOGY FOR STRUCTURAL GENOMICS OF BREAST CANCER Genomics research is providing unprecedented access to expression vectors for thousands of proteins and it is critical to develop faster structure-determination technology to discover their cellular roles. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful and widely used method to determine accurate protein structures, but is also time consuming. Progress in understanding eukaryotic mechanisms of replication, transcription and translation depends critically on gaining faster access to structures of domains and proteins identified in human and other genome projects. We propose new technology for fast protein structure determination by solution state NMR. We will develop and demonstrate this technology on the 127 residue bromodomain from yeast Sth1p. Bromodomain has been chosen for its relevance to the regulation of acetylation states of histones in eukaryotic DNA.

"EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR PROTEIN STRUCTURE PREDICTION The goal of this project is to develop a computer algorithm that accurately predicts the tertiary fold of a protein given only its amino acid sequence and sparse experimental constraints or an imperfect secondary structure prediction. It will use an evolutionary optimization algorithm, a detailed atomic representation, and a proprietary method for deriving a protein energy function. The specific aims of Phase II are: (1) improve the representation of the problem; (2) improve the optimization algorithm; (3) parameterize a more accurate protein energy function; and (4) validate the prototype algorithm and energy function on a large sample of known protein structures and in blind structure prediction experiments. In Phase III the algorithm will be developed into commercial software products for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  The long-term goal is to help satisfy the rapidly growing demand for the accurate prediction of protein structures from sequence information. This demand arises not only from the exponential growth of the database of sequences, but also from the need to understand the structure and function of newly discovered gene products known to be involved in human disease.

It will use an evolutionary optimization algorithm, a detailed atomic representation, and a proprietary method for deriving a protein energy function. The specific aims of Phase II are: (1) improve the representation of the problem; (2) improve the optimization algorithm; (3) parameterize a more accurate protein energy function; and (4) validate the prototype algorithm and energy function on a large sample of known protein structures and in blind structure prediction experiments. In Phase III the algorithm will be developed into commercial software products for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  The long-term goal is to help satisfy the rapidly growing demand for the accurate prediction of protein structures from sequence information. This demand arises not only from the exponential growth of the database of sequences, but also from the need to understand the structure and function of newly discovered gene products known to be involved in human disease.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY Computer algorithms based on pattern recognition are being used in many areas of science and technology to assist the scientist in solving complex, time-consuming, and often tedious real-world problems.  The basic premise is to train a computer to efficiently identify a known pattern in an unknown dataset.  This needle-in-a-haystack approach is being used in the area of genomics, where there are already several examples of very powerful computational pattern recognition approaches available for searching new sequences for structural motifs, similarities to other proteins and DNA, and predicting secondary structure, based solely on the DNA or amino acid sequence.  We believe that macromolecular crystallography can also benefit from the application of pattern recognition to the often daunting task of fitting atoms into an electron density map.  The fact that electron density maps are three-dimensional images provides an additional challenge to this technology in that the procedures we are developing in order to find matching patterns must be rotation invariant.  To test the validity of our hypothesis we will complete the following aims: 1) we will develop a set of rotation invariant features that can characterize the patterns in regions of an electron density map, 2) we will determine the optimal size of feature regions and the size and type of structural database required to find similar regions of electron density capable of accurately determining structures, and 3) we will develop a methodology to synthesize matched regions to produce coherent local and global models of protein structure. If these goals can be met, we will investigate the feasibility of incorporating knowledge-based methods, neural networks, and other AI techniques to augment the interpretation of structures from electron density maps.  In addition, we will attempt to extend this methodology to produce initial structures for electron density maps that are either of poor quality and/or low resolution.  n/a",PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY,6182183,R21GM059398,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' electron crystallography', ' electron density', ' molecular biology information system', ' physical model', ' protein structure', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2000,101500,0.028012475114905837
"VIRUS STRUCTURE DETERMINATION SOFTWARE Virus structure determination using electron microscopy has become a useful research tool aimed at understanding viral assembly and infectivity to facilitate the design of anti-viral drugs and virus-based gene delivery systems. Our long term goal is to broaden the group of people able to determine virus structures by providing an integrated software suite for three-dimensional virus structure determination using electron microscopy. The software suite, called Tumbleweed, will allow easy, efficient, and routine determination of icosahedral virus structures from electron micrographs. Novel aspects of Tumbleweed will include a comprehensive suite of tools for icosahedral structure determination, incorporation of an expert system to guide users through the reconstruction procedure, and data analysis tools to ensure that structures are determined accurately. Tumbleweed will also provide a consistent easy to use graphical user interface to all reconstruction tools including data analysis, data management, and data logging. In addition, Tumbleweed will provide tools for image selection, quality assessment, and structure visualization that can be used with any electron microscopy structure determination method. Thus, in addition to virologists, target users include electron microscopists and structural biologists.

"Building protein structure models for intermediate resolution cryo-electron microscopy maps Project Summary Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an emerging technique in structural biology, which is capable of determining three-dimensional (3D) structures of biological macromolecules. Compared to conventional structural biology techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR, a major advantage of cryo-EM is its ability to solve large macromolecular assemblies. Moreover, recent technical breakthroughs in cryo-EM have enabled determination of 3D structures at nearly atomic-level resolutions. Cryo-EM will undoubtedly become a method of central importance in structural biology in the next decade. With the rapid accumulation of cryo-EM structure data, it has become crucial to develop computational methods that can effectively build and extract 3D structures of biological macromolecules from EM maps. The goal of this project is to develop computational methods for modeling both global and local structures and for interpreting 3D structures embedded in EM maps of around 4 Å to medium-resolution. Recently, we have developed a new de novo protein structure modeling method, MAINMAST, which can model protein structures from an EM density map without using existing template or fragment structures on the map. Based on the successful development of MAINMAST, we further extend the capability of MAINMAST toward more accurate modeling and for multiple-chain modeling. In addition, we will also develop novel modeling methods for medium-resolution EM maps, which combine a coarse-grained protein structure modeling technique, methods in protein structure prediction, and a low- resolution image processing approach with deep learning, a state-of-the-art powerful machine learning method. The proposed project capitalizes on the tremendous efforts and progress made in structural determination with cryo-EM by developing computational tools that allow researchers to perform efficient and reliable structure analyses for 3D EM density maps. The project will greatly facilitate investigation into the molecular mechanisms of macromolecule function by providing an efficient means of 3D structure modeling. Narrative Cryo-electron microscopy is an emerging technique for determining the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules.

"High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy. Because they are sensitive to the biological functional groups, detailed geometries, and chemical environments, they allow for prediction of solution phase protein structures or to identify or verify the structure of chemical compounds in the crystalline phase. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for NMR spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this equipment supplement we are proposing to acquire a dedicated compute cluster for high throughput calculations of wavefunction-based QM methods we have developed for chemical shifts that offer improved accuracy over DFT. This will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein and small molecule drug relevant for machine learning methods we have developed under NIH support. With such data, machine learning and deep networks will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting data science driven methods will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and small molecule drug prediction. NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This supplemental equipment proposal aims to use machine learning on QM data through the purchase of a high-throughput GPU/CPU cluster, and will significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or drug crystal, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,10145510,U01GM121667,"['Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'crystallinity', 'drug structure', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2020,150000,0.029337738302800127
"Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions Protein-peptide interactions are prevalent in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulation, and immune response. Peptide-based therapeutics have attracted much attention in recent years, and a significantly growing number of peptide-based medicines have been designed and approved for a variety of diseases. Therefore, studying protein-peptide interactions is of great significance for mechanistic investigation of many biological processes and for peptide therapeutic development. However, because of the difficulties and cost for determining such structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, currently there are only a limited number of protein-peptide complex structures in the Protein Data Bank. Thus, the ability to predict protein- peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. However, structure prediction for protein-peptide complexes is challenging, particularly due to peptide flexibility. In this project, we will address this challenging issue by innovative integration of bioinformatics and physical modeling approaches. Specifically, we propose to achieve four goals: Goal #1: We will develop novel deep-learning models for protein-peptide structure prediction. Despite successful application of deep learning to protein structure prediction and protein-ligand interaction, deep learning has not been applied to protein-peptide structure prediction yet, due to the flexibility and the resulting large degrees of freedom in peptides. Goal #2: We will develop the first in silico screening method for the search of peptide-based inhibitors, and will construct novel peptide libraries for screening. Our in silico method will be an attractive complement to valuable experimental technologies such as phage display and yeast two-hybrid system for rapid peptide screening at much lower cost. Goal #3: We will convert our computational algorithms into a modular, extensible, open-source software package that can be disseminated to the computational modeling community at no cost. Goal #4. As a proof-of-concept application of our in silico screening method, we will screen for novel peptide leads by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance, in collaboration with my experimental collaborator whose expertise is in molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology. The ability to predict protein-peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. We propose to tackle the challenge of protein- peptide structure prediction, including developing the first in silico peptide screening method to dramatically save cost and time.

"Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions Project Summary  Understanding enzyme mechanisms is of paramount importance from both the basic biophysics perspective of understanding life processes and the role of enzymes in diseases. To achieve a detailed understanding of enzyme catalysis, the effects of protein structure and dynamics on the reaction energetics need to be elucidated. We propose a combined computational and experimental approach that combines the synthetic, computational and structural biology expertise of a team of investigators that has been working together for >15 years to create a “molecular movie” where the position, movement and energy of every atom in the system followed over the entire reaction pathway. The proposal exploits the emerging convergence of timescales accessible by molecular simulation using GPUs and time resolved structural biology. Specific Aim 1 describes the simulation of the complete reaction pathway of Pseudomonas mevalonii (Pm) HMGCoA Reductase (HMGR) and will use transition state force fields (TSFFs) generated by the quantum guided molecular mechanics method to allow the µsec MD simulations of the chemical steps. TSFFs not only circumvent the well-known boundary problem of QM/MM, but are also 102-104 times faster. This allows a realistic modeling of the coupling of µsec dynamics and catalysis that was demonstrated in the last grant period to be essential for understanding the reaction. Together with accelerated MD simulations of the conformational changes involved in the reaction using standard force fields, these computational studies cover the fsec to µsec timescale. In Specific Aim 2, the computational results will be merged with the results of a three-tiered approach to obtain structural snapshots with progressively increasing time resolution: (i) “Frozen” intermediates that map out the overall pathway on long timescales, (ii) time resolved Laue crystallography using pH jump initiation on the msec timescale and (iii) use of photocaged substrates to allow time resolved Laue experiments on the µsec timescale. This approach will be applied to the study of HMGR, an enzyme of high biophysical and biomedical significance that has a complex reaction mechanism involving three chemical steps, six large-scale conformational changes and two cofactor exchange steps. The project is highly innovative because it (i) uses a combination of MD simulations using TSFFs and time resolved crystallography to span timescales of at least 12 orders of magnitude, (ii) iteratively couples the Markov State analysis of long timescale trajectories to the Singular Value Decomposition used to analyze time resolved crystallography data, thus providing new tools to generate and experimentally validate trial structures (iii) applies global optimization and machine learning techniques to allow the automated fitting of TSFFs for proteins, which will enhance the application of this powerful method to other proteins and (iv) provides new photocaged substrates for the study of enzyme mechanisms to the chemical biology community. All tool compounds, methods and codes developed in this project will be made available to the scientific community. Public Health Statement  The detailed study of enzyme mechanisms is a cornerstone of biophysical chemistry that, while basic in nature, has had a major impact on human health including the development of new mechanism-based drugs for a range of diseases and an understanding of the mechanism of action for existing drugs that allows the design of combination therapies. The combination of Laue crystallography and long-scale MD simulations will allow simultaneous studies of structure, dynamics and energetic studies with unprecedented detail. The application to HMG CoA Reductase, arguably the single most important drug target in western industrialized countries, will demonstrate the applicability of the methodology to an enzyme of high mechanistic complexity. 1","Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions",9897100,R01GM111645,"['Active Sites', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Couples', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enzymatic Biochemistry', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Movement', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nature', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Pseudomonas', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical chemistry', 'cofactor', 'computer studies', 'design', 'electron density', 'enzyme mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'millisecond', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'molecular scale', 'movie', 'new therapeutic target', 'particle', 'protein structure', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'structural biology', 'synthetic biology', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2020,335664,0.023029354715685683
"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease.

"New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures RNA molecules play fundamental roles in nearly all cellular processes at the level of gene expression and regulation. Not surprisingly, emerging biomedical advances such as precision medicine and synthetic biology all point to RNA as the central regulators and information carriers. Recently, realizing the potential of using RNA to intervene gene expression, scientists successfully developed Onpattro, the ﬁrst FDA-approved RNA-based therapy in August 2018.  Understanding RNA function and therapeutic applications requires knowledge about RNA structure. Unfortu- nately, currently, the number of the known structures is a small fraction of what need to be determined. This gap has to be closed by computational methods. Furthermore, an RNA molecule is a highly charged polyanion and positive charges such as metal ions bind to an RNA and for an integral part of an RNA structure. Where and how metal ions interact with an RNA can directly impact RNA structure and function as well as RNA-drug interactions.  Continuously supported by NIH for over 15 years, we have developed systematic computational tools for the predictions of RNA structures, folding stability, kinetics, and metal ion effects. These tools have led to fruitful applications in virology, microbiology, gene therapy, RNA biotechnology, and various RNA-based therapeutic de- signs. However, despite over decade of efforts, many critical issues in computational RNA biology still remain: de novo prediction of non-Watson-Crick interactions, structure prediction for large RNAs, effective incorporation of experimental data such as cryo-EM and NMR data into structure prediction, and modeling of metal ion ef- fects. In this grant, after 15 years of developing an initio physics-based models, we propose to target the above and other pressing issues using a fundamentally different approach by systematically developing data-driven (such as deep-learning) or hybrid data-driven/physics-based simulation methods. The new approaches are mo- tivated by the increasing amount of experimental data and the pressing need to have more efﬁcient and reliable computational tools for data interpretation, especially for structure determination experiments. We will use ex- perimental database, such as RNA-Puzzles database, PDB, EMDataBank, BMRB, for large-scale benchmark tests, and biochemical and NMR data collected by our well-established collaborators for in-depth and interactive information about various experiments such as HCV genomic RNAs and HIV PBS systems. Our goal, if success- fully accomplished, will immediately impact experiments such as structure determination, including cryo-EM and NMR-based structure determination, identiﬁcation of metal ion sites, and rational design of RNA structures for therapeutic applications. RNA structures and interactions hold the key to many important biological processes. This project develops cutting-edge computational methods for the predictions of RNA structures and interactions. The results from the project will lead to novel computational tools for understanding disease mechanism at molecular level and for the rational design of RNA-based therapeutics. !",New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures,9851572,R35GM134919,"['Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Charge', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hybrids', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Physics', 'Play', 'RNA', 'RNA Computations', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene therapy', 'genomic RNA', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'polyanion', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'success', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2020,240392,0.07628948063593191
"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research. Project Narrative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas proteins offer an unprecedented opportunity to precisely manipulate RNA biology in ways not currently possible.

"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research. Project Narrative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas proteins offer an unprecedented opportunity to precisely manipulate RNA biology in ways not currently possible. We propose several innovative approaches to address critical knowledge gaps in CRISPR-Cas tool development and chart a path to use these tools to interrogate several fundamental questions in RNA biology.

"Computer Simulations of Enzymes Computer simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) and the combined quantum  mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach are capable of describing structures and dynamics  of proteins and chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. An accurate and  computationally efficient energy function is necessary. However, challenges remain: the  accuracy of QM method, the compatibility between the electron density of the QM subsystem and  classical force fields for the MM subsystem, and the cost of ab initio QM/MM methods capitalizing  on the accuracy and reliability of the associated QM approaches. To address these challenges, we  have developed a series of ab initio QM/MM approaches on reaction path optimizations and free  energy calculations, the QM/MM minimum free-energy path (QM/MM-MFEP) and the QM/MM neural  network (QM/MM-NN) methods. This proposal aims to develop further the ab initio QM/MM methodology  and its applications to the studies of redox processes in important enzymes, and the construction  of ab initio force fields combined with neural network representations. Our long-term goals are to develop and establish accurate first-principles based and density  functional theory (DFT) based MD and QM/MM simulation as an equal partner with experiments for the  study of enzymes and proteins and to provide insight into chemical and redox processes in  biological systems. Our aims are as follows: (1) We aim to make ab initio QM/MM models for much  more accurate QM/MM energies, for the QM description and for the electrostatic and vdW interactions   between the QM and MM subsystems. (2) We aim to develop a combined computational  model to explore the key molecular determinants of the reduction potential variability in  metalloproteins. We will provide detailed insight into chemical and redox reaction mechanisms in  biological systems, in particular laccases. (3) We aim at the development of accurate  force fields of water, and proteins for simulations in biological applications, going beyond the  traditional force field forms and limitation in accuracy. The proposed developments will capitalize on the theoretical developments in quantum  electronic theory, such as the linear response theory and accurate many-electron approach for  non-covalent interactions, and leverage machine-learning methods in data science for biological  system simulations. The proposed work will lead to the major advancement of the ab initio QM/MM  method and force fields, and insights into the structure-function paradigm for proteins  and important redox process and reaction mechanisms in enzymes. In addition, it will also lead to  methodology development for design of new drugs and enzyme inhibitors. Understanding chemical reactions and redox processes in solution and in enzymes is of critical  importance, because the structure-function relationship and the catalytic role of enzymes  are fundamental insights in biochemical research, and they are essential for the development of  new or better inhibitors and enzymes. Quantitative tools such as simulations make key contributions  to the investigation of the structure-function relationship, complementing experimental studies.  This proposal aims at developing methods for simulating structures and dynamics in proteins, and  chemical and redox processes catalyzed by enzymes, and investigating the mechanisms of  important enzymes-copper protein laccases, leading to significant advances in research tools for  studying enzymes and contributing to the understanding of life processes, as well as aiding in the  design of inhibitors and drugs.",Computer Simulations of Enzymes,10001530,R01GM061870,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biophysical Process', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copper', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laccase', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mechanics', 'Metalloproteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Potential Energy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical reaction', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'electron density', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'intermolecular interaction', 'machine learning method', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'neural network', 'novel therapeutics', 'perturbation theory', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,360797,0.0007687507467733139
"Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes Despite rapid progress in structural bioinformatics, a rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical framework is missing in our current toolbox for analysis, classification, and organization of individual as well as groups of biomolecules. We have recently developed such a framework based on the elastic shape analysis (ESA) for the comparison of protein and RNA structures. Under this framework, the formal geodesic distance for any two protein/RNA structures can be computed rapidly. Probability distributions can also be built for families of protein/RNA structures, and can be used to classify structures in a principled way through statistical hypothesis testing. In addition, sequence information can be naturally incorporated so that comparison of structures can be conducted in the joint sequence-structure space. We have also developed novel algorithms for matching and analyzing protein surfaces. We propose to significantly further develop these methodologies for important applications in structure biology, including studying chromosome structures by combining both 30 structure and sequence level information. The proposed research will make significant contributions to the following areas: (1) This proposal will fill an important gap in structure biology - the lack of a rigorous mathematical and statistical framework for biomolecular structure comparison; (2) Our proposed unifying framework will allow natural incorporation of sequence information for structure comparison; (3) Our approach can uncover distinct clusters at the deepest level of current classification scheme (i.e. SCOP family), enabling a finer classification of biomolecular structures. Preliminary results indicate that by using carefully measured structural similarity, we will obtain representative sets of proteins of higher quality than those by current sequence similarity based methods; (4) The probabilistic models designed for protein/RNA backbone structures and surfaces will capture the flexible nature of protein structures through the use of ensemble of conformations, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These models will also enable effective characterization of family-specific variations among proteins, an important task none of the existing methods work well; (5) Protein/RNA structures will be organized using network-based data structures using probabilistic approaches. This new organization will effectively integrates sequence, backbone structure, and surface information, facilitating discovery of novel insight; and (6) these new development will be rapidly generalized for studying chromosome structures. This proposed research will allow development of tools that will also be applicable in other areas of shape analysis, including medical image analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Our work will help to increase the communication between the field of protein structure analysis and the field of shape analysis, and will stimulate more cross-over development in methodology and transform research activities in both fields. Analysis, classification and organization of biomolecules are fundamental tasks essential for understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships of biomolecules. In this project, we aim to develop rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical frameworks for such tasks and apply them to study proteins, RNAs and chromosomes.",Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes,9963294,R01GM126558,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family Planning', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Grain', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'database structure', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'genome annotation', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'protein distribution', 'protein structure', 'shape analysis', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool development']",NIGMS,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,308756,0.07994878469042897
"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Although MDS is used as the prototype of disease for this proposal, the system developed will be applicable to multiple diseases with complex phenotypes.",Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions,9983714,R01GM123037,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Liver', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'gene function', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'learning network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'structured data', 'support vector machine', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2020,302225,0.022118619735450425
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,9934213,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,310328,0.020428578078657084
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy Summary In the past decade, we have witnessed a revolutionary progress in camera technology and the attainable resolution of macromolecular assemblies via cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting 3D maps to atomic resolution structures. Whereas single- particle cryo-EM today is capable of directly solving atomic structures of biomolecular assemblies in isolation, electron tomography (ET) in unstained frozen-hydrated samples is widely used to capture the 3D organization of supramolecular complexes in their native (organelle, cell, or tissue) environments. We have identified three inter-related research areas where our computational modeling experience (historically rooted in pre-revolution multi-scale approaches) offers the biggest value to today's post-revolution EM community: (1) medium resolution cryo-EM modeling, (2) the segmentation and denoising of cryo-ET data, and (3) the validation of atomic models and their corresponding maps. The first aim is an extension of promising new ideas in flexible fitting as well as secondary structure prediction for medium resolution maps, which have been our key research areas in the past. medium resolution (5-10Å) maps are still widely used in EM and can be of significant biological importance. This is particularly true in the case of cryo-ET maps, which are harder to read than single particle cryo-EM maps because they often exhibit considerable noise, anisotropic resolution, and anisotropic density variations due to the low dose requirements and the missing wedge in the Fourier space. In the case of tightly packed or crowded macromolecular structures, the fusion of nearby biomolecular densities prevents an automated segmentation of geometric shapes, requiring a labor-intensive manual tracing by human experts. We are currently developing novel computational approaches to provide a more objective strategy for missing wedge correction in homogeneous specimen areas of tomograms. Our hybrid approach combines deconvolution and denoising with template matching in a unified mathematical framework that allows modeling constraints to be imposed in a least-squares optimization process. Our approach can also be extended to the flexible refinement of atomic structures using our damped dynamics flexible fitting approach by tuning the internal point-spread functions to the missing wedge of the ET data. To support these aims, we will quantitatively measure the fitness of an atomic model in local density regions and characterize the fitness of maps with reliable reference structures. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include the refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, bacterial chemoreceptor arrays, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established Internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages and as plugins for the popular UCSF Chimera graphics program. Project Narrative This project will help biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels, from the atomic to the living organism. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks. The capacity to make such connections will accelerate new compound discovery as well as create associations between gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, and aid in fast and accurate structure elucidations. Combined with this informatics approach, this proposed continuation project explores innovative methods by which to solve complex molecular structures by enhanced MS and NMR experiments, as well as the development of new algorithms by which to accelerate their analysis. Thus, the overarching goal of this grant is to develop efficient methods that facilitate automated structural classification, structural feature discovery and ultimately efficient structure elucidation of natural products (or any small molecule) and to build an infrastructure that interacts with data input from the community. We will achieve this with the following four specific aims: Aim 1. Integration of MS2 molecular networking with gene cluster networking to rapidly and efficiently locate natural products that have unique molecular architectures; Aim 2. To develop a suite of high sensitivity pulse sequences for natural product structure elucidation; Aim 3. To develop NMR based molecular networking strategies using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to facilitate the categorization and structure elucidation of organic compounds; Aim 4. To integrate NMR molecular networking and MS2-based molecular networking as an efficient structure characterization and elucidation strategy. By achieving these aims we will develop an innovative workflow for finding new compounds and for determining their structures, both quickly and accurately. The connection between gene cluster and molecule will shed light on stereochemistry and potential halogenations and methylations. This information can then be used in combination with more efficient NMR and MS methods to accurately determine structures. These tools will be widely shared, such as through the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Network, to enhance the overall capacity of the natural products and organic chemistry communities to solve complex molecular structures.   Natural products are compounds produced by natural sources and about 50 % of FDA approved drugs can trace their origin back to natural products. This proposal aims to use our data set of natural products produced by cyanobacteria for development of analytical tools that will speed- up and stream-line the discovery and structure elucidation of new compounds.  ",Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products,9921415,R01GM107550,"['Algae', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Light', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'analog', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genome sequencing', 'halogenation', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'social', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,514429,0.044637501226003504
"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9987332,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'human disease', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'structured data', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2020,585552,0.07181469360791128
"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame. We propose to develop a new physics-based computational accelerator for Molecular Dynamics, called MELD, which incorporates many types of relevant external information that was too vague and difficult to compute to have been practically useful before.",MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference,9848587,R01GM125813,"['Affinity', 'Alanine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blind', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'peptide structure', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'scale up', 'simulation']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,317007,0.004750403392559865
"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy, and are sensitive both to the functional groups that are present and to their detailed geometries and chemical environment. As such these NMR measurements could be used to develop protein structures with a quality equivalent to high resolution X-ray crystallography but in their native aqueous environments. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this proposal, we will develop a new, first principles quantum mechanical (QM) based approach to simulation of NMR spectral observables for condensed phase biomolecules and bio-organics. Rapid prototyping of new QM methods will be enabled by the development of a distinctive in-silico NMR laboratory that applies finite magnetic fields and nuclear spins. From this capability, new methods for chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings will emerge that offer improved accuracy versus cost tradeoffs, and will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein relevant and energetically accessible environments. With such data, both artificial neural networks and Bayesian supervised learning approaches will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting eQMCalculator will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and creation of structural ensembles for IDPs. Project Title: High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This proposal aims to significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or IDP ensemble of structures, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,9875487,U01GM121667,"['Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Phase', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantum Theory', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Solvents', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'aqueous', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cost', 'database structure', 'drug structure', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic field', 'personalized approach', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'response', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'structured data', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2020,297077,0.03249682286708858
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9939578,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'algorithm development', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'structured data', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,321599,0.02073662016300993
"Multiscale Analyses of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration PROJECT SUMMARY The cell nucleus is a heterogeneous organelle that consists of nuclear bodies such as nuclear lamina, speckles, nucleoli and PML bodies. These structures continuously tether and tug chromatin at the small and large scales to synergistically orchestrate dynamic functions in distinct spatio-temporal compartments. A major obstacle to the production of navigable 4D reference maps and relating structure to function in the nucleus remains understanding how these different scales of organization influence each other. In particular, we have a poor understanding of the large-scale genome organization. Growing evidence suggests that such nuclear compartmentalization is causally connected with vital genome functions in human health and disease. However, the principles of this nuclear compartmentalization, its dynamics during changes in cell conditions, and its functional relevance are poorly understood. One lesson from Phase 1 4DN was the huge gap in throughput between imaging methods, that directly measure large-scale multi-landmark relationships, and genomic methods, that aim for whole genome high-resolution maps but are indirect measurements and provide limited information about large-scale compartments. For this 4DN UM1 Center application, we propose to meet these needs through the following Aims: (1) Generate multi-modal imaging and genomic datasets to reveal the structure, dynamics, and function of nuclear compartmentalization; (2) Develop and apply computational tools for data-driven genome structure modeling and integrative analysis of nuclear compartmentalization; (3) Develop an integrative analysis and visualization platform with navigable 4D reference maps of nuclear organization. The combined datasets and results of our proposed approaches will advance our understanding of nuclear compartmentalization, the interwoven connections among different nuclear components, and their functional significance. Our new integrative analysis tools and data-driven predictive models will produce more complete nuclear organization reference maps that integrate large-scale chromosome structure data from live and super-resolution microscopy with multi-modal genomic data including smaller scale chromatin interaction maps and predict functional relationships and dynamic responses. Our navigable reference maps will be publicly accessible through an analysis platform that provides interactive visualization of multiple data types, thus enabling investigators with diverse expertise to simultaneously explore their own data and related datasets/tools and promoting collaborations that will open new horizons into the role of the 4D nucleome in human health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will enhance our understanding of nuclear genome organization and functions that are increasingly being linked to health and disease. Because we develop tools to disseminate this information and enable others to work with our data and their own data, we will also bring nuclear architecture to bear on a broad range of ongoing health related research. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission that seeks to obtain fundamental knowledge that will help to improve human health.",Multiscale Analyses of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration,10156141,UM1HG011593,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytology', 'DNA Replication Timing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interphase Chromosome', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cell cycle genetics', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data exploration', 'data integration', 'data tools', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental function', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'multiscale data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'structured data', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,UM1,2020,2075409,0.005595814714377315
