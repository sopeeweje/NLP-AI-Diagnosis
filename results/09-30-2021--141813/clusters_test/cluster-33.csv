"New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures RNA molecules play fundamental roles in nearly all cellular processes at the level of gene expression and regulation. Not surprisingly, emerging biomedical advances such as precision medicine and synthetic biology all point to RNA as the central regulators and information carriers. Recently, realizing the potential of using RNA to intervene gene expression, scientists successfully developed Onpattro, the ﬁrst FDA-approved RNA-based therapy in August 2018.  Understanding RNA function and therapeutic applications requires knowledge about RNA structure. Unfortu- nately, currently, the number of the known structures is a small fraction of what need to be determined. This gap has to be closed by computational methods. Furthermore, an RNA molecule is a highly charged polyanion and positive charges such as metal ions bind to an RNA and for an integral part of an RNA structure. Where and how metal ions interact with an RNA can directly impact RNA structure and function as well as RNA-drug interactions.  Continuously supported by NIH for over 15 years, we have developed systematic computational tools for the predictions of RNA structures, folding stability, kinetics, and metal ion effects. These tools have led to fruitful applications in virology, microbiology, gene therapy, RNA biotechnology, and various RNA-based therapeutic de- signs. However, despite over decade of efforts, many critical issues in computational RNA biology still remain: de novo prediction of non-Watson-Crick interactions, structure prediction for large RNAs, effective incorporation of experimental data such as cryo-EM and NMR data into structure prediction, and modeling of metal ion ef- fects. In this grant, after 15 years of developing an initio physics-based models, we propose to target the above and other pressing issues using a fundamentally different approach by systematically developing data-driven (such as deep-learning) or hybrid data-driven/physics-based simulation methods. The new approaches are mo- tivated by the increasing amount of experimental data and the pressing need to have more efﬁcient and reliable computational tools for data interpretation, especially for structure determination experiments. We will use ex- perimental database, such as RNA-Puzzles database, PDB, EMDataBank, BMRB, for large-scale benchmark tests, and biochemical and NMR data collected by our well-established collaborators for in-depth and interactive information about various experiments such as HCV genomic RNAs and HIV PBS systems. Our goal, if success- fully accomplished, will immediately impact experiments such as structure determination, including cryo-EM and NMR-based structure determination, identiﬁcation of metal ion sites, and rational design of RNA structures for therapeutic applications. RNA structures and interactions hold the key to many important biological processes. This project develops cutting-edge computational methods for the predictions of RNA structures and interactions. The results from the project will lead to novel computational tools for understanding disease mechanism at molecular level and for the rational design of RNA-based therapeutics. !",New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures,10130568,R35GM134919,"['Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Charge', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hybrids', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Physics', 'Play', 'RNA', 'RNA Computations', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene therapy', 'genomic RNA', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'polyanion', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'success', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2021,496674
"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research. Project Narrative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas proteins offer an unprecedented opportunity to precisely manipulate RNA biology in ways not currently possible. We propose several innovative approaches to address critical knowledge gaps in CRISPR-Cas tool development and chart a path to use these tools to interrogate several fundamental questions in RNA biology. Our approaches will help us define the gRNA design rules for RNA-targeting Cas proteins, and develop robust new RNA-targeting Cas tools to manipulate RNA splicing and dissect protein- RNA interaction networks, and ultimately, the tools developed here will transform the way we study RNA and will broadly impact the fields of molecular and cell biology.",Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology,10160925,R35GM133462,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'BCAR1 gene', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Floods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microprocessor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Transcript', 'base', 'clinical application', 'design', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'single cell analysis', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R35,2021,385000
"Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes Despite rapid progress in structural bioinformatics, a rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical framework is missing in our current toolbox for analysis, classification, and organization of individual as well as groups of biomolecules. We have recently developed such a framework based on the elastic shape analysis (ESA) for the comparison of protein and RNA structures. Under this framework, the formal geodesic distance for any two protein/RNA structures can be computed rapidly. Probability distributions can also be built for families of protein/RNA structures, and can be used to classify structures in a principled way through statistical hypothesis testing. In addition, sequence information can be naturally incorporated so that comparison of structures can be conducted in the joint sequence-structure space. We have also developed novel algorithms for matching and analyzing protein surfaces. We propose to significantly further develop these methodologies for important applications in structure biology, including studying chromosome structures by combining both 30 structure and sequence level information. The proposed research will make significant contributions to the following areas: (1) This proposal will fill an important gap in structure biology - the lack of a rigorous mathematical and statistical framework for biomolecular structure comparison; (2) Our proposed unifying framework will allow natural incorporation of sequence information for structure comparison; (3) Our approach can uncover distinct clusters at the deepest level of current classification scheme (i.e. SCOP family), enabling a finer classification of biomolecular structures. Preliminary results indicate that by using carefully measured structural similarity, we will obtain representative sets of proteins of higher quality than those by current sequence similarity based methods; (4) The probabilistic models designed for protein/RNA backbone structures and surfaces will capture the flexible nature of protein structures through the use of ensemble of conformations, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These models will also enable effective characterization of family-specific variations among proteins, an important task none of the existing methods work well; (5) Protein/RNA structures will be organized using network-based data structures using probabilistic approaches. This new organization will effectively integrates sequence, backbone structure, and surface information, facilitating discovery of novel insight; and (6) these new development will be rapidly generalized for studying chromosome structures. This proposed research will allow development of tools that will also be applicable in other areas of shape analysis, including medical image analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Our work will help to increase the communication between the field of protein structure analysis and the field of shape analysis, and will stimulate more cross-over development in methodology and transform research activities in both fields. Analysis, classification and organization of biomolecules are fundamental tasks essential for understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships of biomolecules. In this project, we aim to develop rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical frameworks for such tasks and apply them to study proteins, RNAs and chromosomes.",Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes,10189648,R01GM126558,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family Planning', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Grain', 'Hi-C', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'database structure', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'genome annotation', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'protein distribution', 'protein structure', 'shape analysis', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool development']",NIGMS,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,308756
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,10167719,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,310328
"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame. We propose to develop a new physics-based computational accelerator for Molecular Dynamics, called MELD, which incorporates many types of relevant external information that was too vague and difficult to compute to have been practically useful before.",MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference,10075288,R01GM125813,"['Affinity', 'Alanine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blind', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'peptide structure', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'scale up', 'simulation']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2021,317007
"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"Mechanoregulation of Ciliary Motility Project Summary Mechanoregulation is a fundamental mechanism for the control of dynamic and multiscale biological systems. A mechanoregulatory network is responsible for the motility of cilia by converting the action of thousands of individual dynein motors bound to doublet microtubules in the cilium into a single waveform. This waveform has evolved to efficiently displace fluid, allowing either cell self-propulsion or the transport of extracellular liquid over epithelial surfaces. Ciliary motility in humans is therefore essential for the movement of sperm cells, the removal of bacteria and viruses from the respiratory tract, and the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Cilia are also used by protozoan pathogens for movement, contributing to their pathogenicity. The biflagellate alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has become the model system for studying the relationship between cilia ultrastructure and ciliary motilty. Using this organism, we have determined single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the bases of dyneins and mechanoregulatory complexes natively bound to doublet microtubules. These structures map the interconnected network of microtubules, mechanoregulators, and dynein motors in unparalleled atomic detail. The structures reveal the mechanisms that dock mechanoregulators to doublet microtubules and generate new hypotheses for how they control dynein behavior. These preliminary structural studies provide a unique opportunity to better understand the structure, function and assembly pathway of the largest mechanoregulator, the radial spoke. In aim 1, I propose to elucidate the complete structure of a native radial spoke using cryo-EM and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Structural information will resolve how its 20+ unique subunits interact and function together to respond to both mechanical and chemical signals. Due to the high conservation of radial-spoke subunits among organisms, our structure will provide insights into the etiology of ciliopathy-causing mutations in humans. In aim 2, I propose to test hypotheses that have arisen from our “on-doublet” structures using an interdisciplinary combination of structure-guided mutagenesis, waveform analysis by high-speed microcinematography, and structural characterization using electron cryotomography. This work will provide experimental evidence for the fundamental molecular mechanisms that control ciliary motility. In aim 3, I propose to use a proteomic and structural approach to determine the mechanisms of radial-spoke assembly. This work will test our current structure-based model of assembly and has the potential to identify the first radial-spoke biogenesis factors. Collectively, these studies will provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into the mechanoregulatory pathways that control ciliary motility and promises to open new avenues for the treatment of ciliopathies. Project Narrative Motile cilia are microtubule-based organelles that produce a driving force for cellular locomotion or fluid flow. In humans, defects in motile cilia can lead to infertility, chronic respiratory disease, and even reversal of the orientation of the bodily organs. This project aims to reveal the detailed workings of the mechanoregulatory network that controls ciliary motility, which will help us to better understand the molecular basis of cilia-related diseases.",Mechanoregulation of Ciliary Motility,10180150,R01GM141109,"['Algae', 'Animal Model', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Chlamydomonas reinhardtii', 'Chronic', 'Cilia', 'Cilium Microtubule', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Electrons', 'Epithelial', 'Etiology', 'Excision', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Machines', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oocytes', 'Organ', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Radial', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory System', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell motility', 'ciliopathy', 'cilium motility', 'crosslink', 'driving force', 'extracellular', 'fluid flow', 'insight', 'nexin', 'novel', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory virus', 'sperm cell']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,414050
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,10168567,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'algorithm development', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2021,321398
"Center for Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) PROJECT SUMMARY  Experimental determination of protein structure often provides atomic accuracy models, but is inherently time- consuming, often costly, and not always possible. Computational modeling is currently less accurate, but offers an alternative approach when experimental results are not available. The goal of CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) is to advance the protein structure modeling field by conducting community-wide experiments that objectively determine the strengths and weaknesses of current methods and so foster progress. Approximately 100 research groups world-wide participate. In the most recent experiment (2018), there were 57,000 submissions in nine modeling categories, including over 35,000 tertiary structure models. The Center provides the infrastructure for CASP and Aim 1 is the continued development and operation of this resource. Principal tasks include registration and communication with participants; solicitation, characterization, and management of modeling targets; collection and validation of models; and extensive numerical analysis of submissions. These operations are supported by a secure and robust data infrastructure. The Center also develops evaluation, analysis, and display software, and provides access to models and evaluation results. CASP relies on independent assessors, experts in modeling or a related experimental field, to interpret the results. The Center coordinates this process, providing evaluation data and, when necessary, implementing new evaluation methods.  Recent CASPs have shown dramatic improvements in model accuracy, especially for the most difficult cases where homology modeling cannot be used. A major factor driving progress is the use of new machine learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks. These and related methods appear poised to make further major advances in a number of key modeling areas. The plan for the next period of the project is designed to capitalize on these and other opportunities for progress. Greater success with modeling small proteins and domains dictates a shift in emphasis to the still challenging area of large multi-domain proteins and complexes (Aim 2), where progress is expected both from the machine learning developments and from the incorporation of sparse experimental data. Although accuracy of models has improved, it is still seldom competitive with experiment. Aim 3 is to pursue strategies that will make models more accurate and useful, by nurturing further progress in refining initial models, better methods for estimating model accuracy, and assessment of the utility of models. Aim 4 introduces new ways of strengthening interactions between CASP and the broader research community, providing models that directly address contemporary problems (for example, for CoV-2 protein structures) and boosting communications through meetings, webinars, publications and other means. PROJECT NARRATIVE Knowledge of macromolecular structure plays a crucial role in biology and medicine, allowing for detailed studies and understanding of biological processes and disease mechanisms. Yet, relatively few structures are obtained experimentally - the rest must be modeled. The Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction program (CASP), provides the primary means of evaluating performance of the methods dedicated to this task.",Center for Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP),10220601,R01GM100482,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Design', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Homology Modeling', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Secure', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Series', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data infrastructure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'member', 'method development', 'online resource', 'operation', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'structural biology', 'success', 'symposium', 'vaccine development', 'webinar']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,638990
"Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions Protein-peptide interactions are prevalent in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulation, and immune response. Peptide-based therapeutics have attracted much attention in recent years, and a significantly growing number of peptide-based medicines have been designed and approved for a variety of diseases. Therefore, studying protein-peptide interactions is of great significance for mechanistic investigation of many biological processes and for peptide therapeutic development. However, because of the difficulties and cost for determining such structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, currently there are only a limited number of protein-peptide complex structures in the Protein Data Bank. Thus, the ability to predict protein- peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. However, structure prediction for protein-peptide complexes is challenging, particularly due to peptide flexibility. In this project, we will address this challenging issue by innovative integration of bioinformatics and physical modeling approaches. Specifically, we propose to achieve four goals: Goal #1: We will develop novel deep-learning models for protein-peptide structure prediction. Despite successful application of deep learning to protein structure prediction and protein-ligand interaction, deep learning has not been applied to protein-peptide structure prediction yet, due to the flexibility and the resulting large degrees of freedom in peptides. Goal #2: We will develop the first in silico screening method for the search of peptide-based inhibitors, and will construct novel peptide libraries for screening. Our in silico method will be an attractive complement to valuable experimental technologies such as phage display and yeast two-hybrid system for rapid peptide screening at much lower cost. Goal #3: We will convert our computational algorithms into a modular, extensible, open-source software package that can be disseminated to the computational modeling community at no cost. Goal #4. As a proof-of-concept application of our in silico screening method, we will screen for novel peptide leads by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance, in collaboration with my experimental collaborator whose expertise is in molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology. The ability to predict protein-peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. We propose to tackle the challenge of protein- peptide structure prediction, including developing the first in silico peptide screening method to dramatically save cost and time. We will screen for peptide inhibitors by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance.",Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions,10145049,R35GM136409,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Attention', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Disease', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Investigation', 'Ligands', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides', 'Phage Display', 'Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'combat', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'in silico', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'peptide structure', 'physical model', 'protein data bank', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'therapeutic development', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2021,383330
