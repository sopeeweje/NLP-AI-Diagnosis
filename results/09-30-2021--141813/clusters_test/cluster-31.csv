"Personalizing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are guideline- recommended therapies for preventing end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in patients with CKD. However, in real-world practice, ACEIs/ARBs are frequently discontinued by providers in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI), rapid declines in kidney function, or advanced CKD. Premature discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs can lead to adverse clinical outcomes among patients with CKD. However, discontinuation of these agents may be appropriate for certain CKD subgroups who are at higher risk of AKI and who may derive less benefit from these agents than trial populations. Although guidelines support the use of ACEIs/ARBs in patients with CKD, they also allow for individualization of decisions surrounding their use. However, it is unclear how to best individualize these decisions as CKD progresses to optimize kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. The overall objective of this proposal is to personalize ACEI/ARB therapy for patients with CKD based on each individual's risk factors for ESKD and CVD. To accomplish this, we will use data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study. We will first identify factors that drive the discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs (Aim 1). Next, we will build two clinical tools that model the relationship between ACEI/ARB discontinuation and risk of ESKD (Aim 2) or CVD events (Aim 3) in individuals with CKD. Our long-term goal is to reduce the burden of kidney disease and improve patient outcomes by individualizing medication use in CKD. We expect that completion of these aims will result in the development of two prediction tools that can be further refined and implemented in real-world clinical practice as part of a career development award application. The proposed aims are integrated into a comprehensive training plan that includes a Master's Degree in Clinical Research and practical mentored experiences. Through this training plan, Dr. Chen will have the opportunity to 1) learn and apply knowledge in advanced biostatistical and epidemiological methods, including marginal structural modeling; 2) gain familiarity with the CRIC Study database, 3) apply machine learning algorithms to the development of clinical prediction tools, 4) refine skills in scientific writing and presenting research, and 5) advance towards a career development award and independence as a clinical investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to prevent adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on a population level. However, ACEIs/ARBs are frequently discontinued despite guidelines recommending their use as first-line anti-hypertensive agents in CKD. This proposal aims to develop clinical tools that will predict whether individuals are likely to benefit versus be harmed by discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs, with the goal of improving the safe and appropriate use of these agents in CKD.",Personalizing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease,10313873,F32DK130543,"['Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Familiarity', 'Funding', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Solid', 'Stroke', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hyperkalemia', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'personalized care', 'personalized decision', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'skills', 'tool']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2021,88630
"Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes PROJECT SUMMARY The advent of surgery to treat congenital heart disease (CHD) in the second half of the 20th century shifted the care paradigm from palliation of disease fatal in infancy to management of lifelong chronic disease through adulthood. There are now more than 1.5 million adults with CHD living in the United States. These patients have a substantial burden of cardiovascular and other medical comorbidities, as well as markedly increased risk for adverse outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and premature death. The emergence of this population requires new clinical care models as well as the development of novel research tools and infrastructures to address these patients' unique characteristics and healthcare needs. Adult CHD is characterized by substantial complexity, era-dependent heterogeneity in treatment strategies, and time-varying implications of lifelong disease. This burgeoning population is understudied, and the pathophysiology of the component diseases remains incompletely understood. Billing and other administrative codes available in the electronic medical record are neither sensitive nor specific for CHD diagnosis and do not adequately describe many other salient clinical features. As a result, structured data in large administrative databases are not well suited to studying adults with CHD, even when the goal is simply to identify a cohort of patients with a given diagnosis. This constitutes a major impediment to research efforts and is the primary barrier underlying the limited population-based research performed to date. Adult CHD investigation would benefit immensely from methods to establish harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets. While billing codes are inadequate, the information needed to accurately classify adults with CHD is already available in the electronic medical record in the form of clinical notes, comprised mainly of unstructured (“free”) text. Manual data extraction is laborious, resource intensive, and, therefore, not scalable. We propose to apply cutting-edge natural language processing approaches to unstructured text in the electronic medical record to develop computable classifiers for variables fundamental to the study of adults with CHD. We will use two unique institutional data resources at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital that are already populated with expert-adjudicated labels to train classifiers for key phenotypes that are poorly defined by administrative codes. These classifiers will be validated in an independent patient cohort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and tested in new disease-specific risk prediction models. This work promises to accelerate CHD research by massively increasing the scale of the patient cohorts that can be studied and by establishing a foundation for improved evidence-based decision support for this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Administrative billing codes are inadequate to support research for adults with congenital heart disease, a growing but understudied population with a high burden of medical comorbidities. To advance high quality research towards much-needed innovations in clinical care for these patients, we plan to develop novel methods for the creation of harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets that will expand and enhance collaborative research efforts.",Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes,10214688,R01HL151604,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Heart Septal Defects', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Eisenmenger Complex', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Nomenclature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transposition of Great Vessels', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'administrative database', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical data repository', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliation', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,738379
"A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Allen Lee, MD is a gastroenterologist with advanced training in gastrointestinal motility whose research focuses on identifying abnormalities in host-microbial interactions to improve care in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals are to identify novel subgroups of IBS patients which inform biological responses to therapies and guide management. The proposed K23 mentored career development award includes a 3-year plan for training, didactics, and research activities that will provide Dr. Lee with the necessary skills and experience to become a successful independent investigator. Career Development: Dr. Lee will develop skills in the following four areas: 1) culture-independent approaches to study host-microbial interactions in IBS; 2) advanced biostatistical methods to study longitudinal datasets, including mixed models or generalized additive models; 3) laboratory-based translational techniques; 4) predictive analytics, such as machine learning algorithms. These training goals will directly contribute to Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals and prepare him to submit a successful R01 application. Research Context: Common treatments in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) are effective in ≤50% patients. Additionally, there are currently no methods to identify patients more likely to respond to different treatments. The current paradigm for managing IBS patients revolves around identifying and treating the predominant symptom complexes. However, this is a hugely inefficient model and leads to frustration for both patients and health care providers. This proposal seeks to determine whether a systems biology approach, which incorporates microbiome and metabolomics data along with detailed clinical phenotype information, may identify novel subgroups that inform treatment decisions in IBS-D. Research Plan: This career development award leverages an on-going clinical trial comparing the effects of a nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin with a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) in IBS-D patients to identify differences in microbial community structure and function in responders vs. non-responders to therapy. Specific Aim 1 will identify fecal microbial features by 16S rRNA sequence analysis characteristic of treatment response to rifaximin or a low FODMAP diet. Specific Aim 2 will determine how treatments with rifaximin or low FODMAP diet affect the fecal metabolome, including short chain fatty acids and bile acids, in IBS-D patients. Specific Aim 3 will develop predictive models to identify subsets of IBS-D patients responsive to treatment. We will also identify risk factors for non-response to either rifaximin or low FODMAP diet. Results from this proposal will inform two future R01 proposals to validate these findings as well as to understand the mechanisms by which host-microbial interactions may mediate response to different therapies in IBS. Project Narrative Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a common but difficult condition to manage likely because it is a heterogeneous disorder. This research proposal seeks to determine whether patients with IBS- D can be better stratified by their fecal microbiome and microbiome-derived metabolites. Results from this proposal may lead to a paradigm change in the way that we manage and treat IBS and potentially lead to an era of precision medicine in IBS.",A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,10125589,K23DK124567,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bile Acids', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Butyrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Data', 'Diarrhea', 'Diet', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Foundations', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monosaccharides', 'Multiomic Data', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Virulence Factors', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'common treatment', 'dietary', 'experience', 'fecal metabolome', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal microbiota', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'polyol', 'potential biomarker', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'response', 'rifaximin', 'skills', 'stem', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2021,194608
"Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach Project Summary Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end stage renal disease. However, improvements in long-term allograft survival have not matched the observed improvements in the management of rejection. Progressive allograft dysfunction is frequently encountered clinically. The final common pathway of cumulative and incremental renal damage from several etiologies identified by histopathology is interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), which is associated with progression of renal dysfunction and reduced allograft survival. Histopathologic assessment and staging of IFTA requires tissue sampling, which is limited due to its invasive nature, risk of complications, inter-individual variability and sampling error. In this proposal, we will test a non-contrast advanced multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol comprised of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) as noninvasive markers of renal allograft fibrosis. This is motivated by our preliminary data demonstrating that mpMRI yields highly repeatable parameter measurements that capture allograft fibrosis. Our preliminary experience correlating mpMRI with IFTA is valuable, as confounding physiologic and pathophysiologic variables such as vascular flow, edema and other Banff phenotypes commonly co-exist. The multiparametric approach allows us to simultaneously capture and characterize these concurrent physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. As a secondary objective, we will assess the value of urinary RNA level based biomarkers, which have been previously validated for the diagnosis of IFTA. In this proposal, we aim to: 1) acquire data in patients undergoing indication and surveillance biopsy, using a non-contrast mpMRI protocol comprised of advanced diffusion weighted and relaxometry methods in order to accurately detect and stage allograft IFTA, and 2) other histopathological Banff measures of inflammation. We will build and validate diagnostic models using advanced statistical methods including machine learning in independent model-building and validation sets of renal transplant patients for detection and staging of each Banff measure, and assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of fibrosis. 3) We will evaluate the performance of mpMRI and urinary biomarkers to predict renal outcomes in a longitudinal study for the entire patient cohort up to 24 months. Our long-term objective is to validate a robust quantitative advanced mpMRI approach and develop models that accurately and non-invasively measure renal allograft fibrosis and clinical outcome, which may potentially impact the care of renal transplant patients by enabling early detection, the non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of disease, therapeutic efficacy of new drugs and for prognostication. Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach Project Narrative Caused by a variety of etiologies, acute and chronic renal allograft injury often results in the development of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), is a significant cause of allograft failure and poor outcomes; the reference standard for which is tissue biopsy, which is limited due to sampling error and risk of complications. In this proposal, we will develop a short, non-contrast multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol, consisting of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) to accurately detect and stage allograft fibrosis, taking into account confounding Banff variables of inflammation and tested against biopsy. We will also assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of IFTA and if successful, this study will benefit a large population of patients with renal allograft fibrosis in the United States, enabling early diagnosis, optimized treatment planning, prognostication and longitudinal disease monitoring.",Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach,10279690,R01DK129888,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Allografting', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'End stage renal failure', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Histopathology', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lesion', 'Living Donors', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proteinuria', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reference Standards', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Sampling Errors', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical encounter', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'diffusion weighted', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'interstitial', 'kidney allograft', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney dysfunction', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'post-transplant', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'renal damage', 'secondary outcome', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'urinary', 'virtual']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,625886
"A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases ABSTRACT  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health epidemic and patients with CKD suffer from increased mortality and cardiovascular disease. Despite the severity of the disease, there are limited treatment options to hinder its progression. Tubular injury (TI) is a common finding on many kidney biopsies from patients with CKD, and there is mechanistic data supporting that TI can lead to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. While interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are the strongest known pathologic predictor of progression of CKD, we have limited understand of how TI contributes to this progression. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) has been shown in animal studies to impact the severity of TI and is also known to trigger a fibrotic cascade, but there is limited data regarding its overall activity in kidney tissue, its cell type specific activity, its association with pathologic features or patient outcomes. It is of utmost importance to better understand this pathway as several Prolyl Hydroxylase inhibitors, which are novel therapeutic agents that increase the expression of HIF- 1α, are currently in clinical trial testing to treat anemia of CKD. The first aim of this proposal is to develop a measure of HIF-1α pathway activity that enables evaluation of clinical and morphologic features and cell-type specificity. Specifically, the candidate will a) Identify clinical and pathologic descriptors associated with increased HIF-1α pathway activity score and b) Determine the cell-type specific expression level of HIF-1α and its downstream components in tubular cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing. The second aim of this proposal is to determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity with outcomes and identify patients with increased HIF-1α activity non-invasively using biomarkers. Specifically, the candidate will a) Determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity score with patient outcomes and b) Identify serum or urine biomarkers that detect increased HIF-1α pathway activity in patients. The candidate will analyze data from 3 cohorts to accomplish these aims: Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), Clinical Phenotyping Resource and Biobank Core (C-PROBE) and the Native Americans with Type 2 Diabetes cohort (formerly known as the Pima Indian cohort). These investigations will allow us to monitor HIF-1α activity non-invasively in trials where patients receive novel drug agents, such as Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors.  The candidate will obtain formal training in analysis of gene expression data, single cell RNA- sequencing and machine learning techniques during the course of the award period to successfully integrate gene expression data, pathology data and clinical data. She will be mentored by an expert team with complementary experience in nephrology, tubular injury biology, systems biology and bioinformatics. The long-term goal of these investigations is to ultimately be able to better sub-type patients with tubular injury based on mechanistic terms. NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease is a global health epidemic and is associated with increased mortality, but we do not have a detailed understanding of why this disease progresses. Identifying sub-types of patients who progress by the same molecular mechanism is important to identify patients for future clinical trials. This project aims to use gene expression data from kidney biopsies to identify patients who will respond differently to medications that increase the expression of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha.",A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases,10126847,K08DK124449,"['Address', 'Anemia', 'Animals', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemic', 'Erythropoietin', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Hypoxia', 'Hypoxia Inducible Factor', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Native Americans', 'Nephrology', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pima Indian', 'Process', 'Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'experience', 'global health', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'phase III trial', 'predictive marker', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2021,168955
"A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients Summary – Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began, the emergence of an associated novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported. Interestingly, patients with MIS-C follow a presentation, management and clinical course that are somewhat similar to that of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD). Currently, the reason for such an overlap in clinical features and management is unclear and whether this overlap is the result of a partially shared etiology or pathophysiology is the subject of fierce debates. The degree of overlap implies that some of the clinical prediction tools that we have developed in the past for KD could be repurposed to accelerate the development of clinical support decision tools for MIS-C. In this study, we will first (R61 component) systematically address the overlap between KD and MIS-C and create salient machine-learning based prediction models for diagnosis/identification (Aim #1), management (Aim #2), and short- and long-term outcomes (Aim #3) of MIS-C based on our previously developed predictive models for KD in a process akin to transfer learning. Secondly (R33 component), we will validate and evaluate the performance and clinical utility of these models in a predictive clinical decision support system for the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients presenting with features indicative of either MIS-C or KD. In this study we will include 3 groups of patients: 1) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with MIS-C (CDC criteria) regardless of whether they have overlapping signs of KD, 2) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection investigated for but eventually not diagnosed with MIS-C, and 3) patients with KD but without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted data will be collected from enrolled patients (900 for training and 450 for validation) for deep phenotyping and biomarker measurements. Physician feedback on the predictions generated by the algorithm will be used to establish clinical utility. Data required for model training will be accrued in the first two years of activity (R61 period of the grant); the development of algorithms and their internal validation will occur concurrently. In the following 2 years (R33 period of the grant), we will perform external validation, establish clinical utility, add real- time epidemiological surveillance data to the models and finally package, and certify the algorithms for future deployment and for the integration in electronic health records. This project will be a collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) Consortium. The IKDR Consortium has an active KD and pediatric COVID registry in 35 sites across the world and the number of sites is currently expanding to 60+ sites. More than 600 MIS-C patients have already been identified at IKDR centers, making this project clearly feasible and perfectly positioning IKDR to perform this study. We strongly believe that the use of emerging data science methods and of our previously developed algorithms in the context of KD, as opposed to focusing on MIS-C patients alone, will boost our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of both MIS-C and KD and will more rapidly lead to the emergence of data-driven management protocols for patients with MIS-C. Project narrative - The primary objective of this study is to design and validate a predictive decision support system for the identification, treatment and management of SARS-CoV-2 associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). To develop this system, we will adapt and retrain machine learning algorithms which we have previously trained in patients with Kawasaki Disease, a pediatric inflammatory vasculopathy with multiple similarities to MIS-C. This study, performed in collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) consortium, will consist of two phases, first a large-scale data collection and algorithm development effort and second, the prospective evaluation of the performance and clinical utility of the algorithm ahead of large-scale deployment.",A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients,10272448,R61HD105591,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Decision Support Systems', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical predictors', 'coronavirus disease', 'design', 'disease registry', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'interoperability', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pediatric patients', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R61,2021,917957
"Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy PROJECT SUMMARY The era of “big data” has opened the door for genomic and systems biology approaches to be applied to current challenges in life sciences and precision medicine. One critical challenge in these areas is how to prioritize research findings to validate and identify actionable insights that can translate into better outcomes for patients. In this regard, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians from academia and industry with a focus on creating discovery pipelines that combine high-throughput profiling technologies with advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to generate predictive tools that enable us to move rapidly from big data to better diagnoses and treatment. In this regard, we propose to apply these approaches to develop a computational clinical decision tool that will improve disease forecasting and treatment plans for Multiple Myeloma (MM), an incurable cancer that originates in bone marrow plasma cells and affects more than 30,000 patients a year. Though there have been some advances in the number and diversity of available therapeutic options for these patients, relapse remains inevitable, and MM ultimately remains a terminal diagnosis. The clinical assay and computational pipeline developed in this project will combine a targeted sequencing panel specific to myeloma patients and clonality estimates with RNA- sequencing and drug repurposing to expand therapeutic options for MM patients. We will develop this unique tool with the following specific aims: (1) Develop an integrated genomic clinical decision tool to guide precision treatment of MM and validate therapy recommendations using PDX profiling, and (2) Validate MM precision medicine platform in a prospective clinical trial and generate clone-specific treatment recommendations. To achieve these objectives, we will integrate a Cancer Genetic, Inc.'s FOCUS::Myeloma panel, a targeted panel designed to specifically interrogateall the genes and copy number alterations commonly altered in myeloma, and into a computational drug selection pipeline that utilizes RNA-sequencing data and drug repurposing algorithms to generate therapeutic recommendations matched to a patient's unique disease profile. These recommendations will be validated in mouse avatars of myeloma to confirm and refine drug predictions. We will implement our assay in a prospective clinical trial of 100 patients to determine if the treatment decisions generated by our pipeline achieves an improvement in standard-of-care. Finally, we will perform clonal modeling on relapsed patients to retrospectively evaluate clone-specific treatment responses. Completion of these studies will result in a clinic-ready assay and computational tool that will guide MM precision treatment decisions and inform new therapeutic strategies based on a patient's unique cancer profile. genomic clonal modeling PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple Myeloma is an incurable cancer of the blood that takes the lives of over 12,000 people every year. It remains a difficult disease to treat due to its genetic complexity from the earliest stages of the disease, indicating a need for a precision medicine approach in treating these patients. In this application Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will partner with Cancer Genetics, Inc. to develop a multi-omics clinical decision assay that will improve long-term outcomes for patients with advanced myeloma and generate valuable insights and tools that can be broadly leveraged for other disease indications.",Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy,10101640,R01CA244899,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Bone Marrow', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Employment', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intake', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mus', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stream', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer genetics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug repurposing', 'efficacy testing', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'pilot trial', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'relapse patients', 'risk stratification', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,531246
"Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence Abstract Development of augmented intelligence (AI) models for predicting clinical outcomes is growing exponentially. Automated clinical surveillance to assist in early detection of in-hospital deterioration such as sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) is a promising AI application. As many as 300,000 US hospital patients die each year from problems like sepsis and AKI and 5% or more of these deaths are preventable. Many more patients suffer harm or additional costs as a sequelae to delayed response. Compared to traditional rule-based risk predictions, advanced AI models using methods such as machine learning demonstrate improved reliability of predicting sepsis and AKI. The effectiveness of these systems in practice will likely depend on how AI risk information is integrated into clinical workflow and technologies, yet we are not aware of research to design or evaluate effective in-hospital AI risk information presentation and user interaction. It is widely known that explainable AI is desirable, but what needs to be explained and how to do it effectively and efficiently is not known. There is a need to understand end user perspectives on the value of AI for specific clinical contexts. We will draw on our team's recent research on effective clinical display design, theoretical models of human-AI performance, application of human-AI design principles, and application of human-centered design methods to design and evaluate effective approaches to support timely response to sepsis and AKI risk. Our primary objectives are to: identify factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of AI usefulness, generate design principles for effective health risk surveillance human-AI interaction, and design human-AI user interfaces that meaningfully improve human-AI performance when responding to sepsis and AKI. In Aim 1, we will develop a temporal reasoning AI model for predicting in-hospital development of sepsis and AKI. We will apply this model to retrospective patient data to serve as context for research activities. Using chart review, we will quantify realistic metrics of human-AI system performance that take into account whether the AI model would have predicted deterioration before the clinical team suspected or acted in response to the event. In Aim 2, we will interview clinicians while reviewing temporal progression of a patient's change in condition over their stay, including AI generated risk information. We will gather qualitative data on factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of usefulness of AI information toward the goal of early identification of patient problems. In Aim 3, we will conduct participatory design activities with clinicians to design effective human-centered AI display and interaction to support early response to in-hospital sepsis and AKI. Finally, in Aim 4, using simulated realistic patient care tasks and comparing to traditional patient information technologies, we will evaluate the impact of human-centered AI designs on human-AI performance. We will generate human-AI interaction design guidance for health risk surveillance. Our findings are expected to innovate design for human-AI interaction in electronic health records (EHRs) and health-care monitoring and communication technologies. Narrative As many as 15,000 preventable deaths and many more preventable invasive procedures occur each year in US hospitals due to late detection of unexpected deterioration and emergencies such as cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, sepsis, and bleeding. Advanced approaches to augmented intelligence (AI) through methods such as machine learning may help clinicians to identify and respond to problems early, but little is known about how to effectively present risk information and support interaction between AI and clinicians. The goals of this project are to: identify factors that impact the usefulness of AI, design human-centered AI approaches to reduce harm from late response to sepsis and acute kidney injury, and generate design principles to ensure that AI solutions can be used effectively by clinicians to improve patient care.",Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence,10217209,R01GM137083,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse event', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Technology', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Saints', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'skills']",NIGMS,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,402815
"Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for measuring the effect of a treatment or intervention. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test all research questions, whether due to cost, achieving sufficient subject sizes or when administering an arm of the trial would be unethical. To understand the effects of therapeutics, policy changes, and other interventions where it is not possible to administer a clinical trial, researchers have developed approaches that attempt to simulate clinical trials in observational data. Despite sophisticated statistical methodologies, it is not clear whether it is possible to reliably simulate a randomized controlled in observational data. We aim to quantify one potential driver of these different results, differences between the clinical trial and real-world populations. In Aim 1, we compare trials that have individual level data available to three real- world data sources. In Aim 2, we develop methodologies to infer most likely individual-level statistics from aggregate trial statistics using real world data. Finally, in Aim 3 we compare neurological trials that do not release individual level data to real world data. We then estimate the transportability of treatment estimates across different populations including: the population eligible for the trial in RWD and the population ineligible for the trial but receiving the treatment in RWD. This allows for the study of indication drift and treatment heterogeneity. By uncovering differences between these groups, we may be able to identify groups that are underrepresented in clinical trials to help reduce healthcare disparities. The K99/R00 award will allow me to gain expertise in using regulatory sciences (with mentor Dr. Florence Bourgeois and advisor Dr. Deborah Schrag) for biologic discovery (with mentors Dr. Tianxi Cai and Dr. Isaac Kohane) within neurology (with mentors Dr. Page Pennell and Dr. Clemens Scherzer). My background in statistics, informatics, genetics, and machine learning with clinical data sources ideally positions me for the proposed project. The proposed training plan, mentoring and project will provide a strong foundation for a successful transition to independent research. Clinical trial populations are a subset of the overall population and may be biased through several factors. To better understand disease, reduce healthcare disparities for underrepresented groups, assess drug approvals, and ensure safety as the indications for a drug expand it is critical to quantify how representative clinical trials are of the real-world population. Identifying enriched and underrepresented groups offers the opportunity to identify subpopulations who may have heterogeneous treatment effects and/or underlying physiologies.",Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations,10127341,K99NS114850,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Approval', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Estrogens', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Menarche', 'Menopause', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perimenopause', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Placebos', 'Policies', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Seizures', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'arm', 'base', 'birth control', 'cost', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder subtype', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness analysis', 'efficacy clinical trial', 'glucosylceramidase', 'health care disparity', 'inclusion criteria', 'interest', 'member', 'multiple data sources', 'oncology trial', 'patient population', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'standard measure', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'unethical']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,118759
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10124273,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'learning classifier', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2021,499995
"Applying deep learning to predict T cell receptor binding specificity of neoantigens and response to checkpoint inhibitors Project Summary Background: In-depth study of neoantigens will promote our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of basic immunology and immune-related disease processes, such as response to cancer immunotherapy. Neoantigens play a key role in the recognition of tumor cells by T cells and are increasingly shown to be targets of checkpoint inhibitor-induced immune response. However, several missing links exist in neoantigen research. (1) Only a small proportion of neoantigens can elicit T cell responses. It is even less clear which neoantigens will be recognized by which specific T cell receptor (TCR). (2) Although neoantigens are important during the course of action of immunotherapies, how neoantigen repertoire data can be used to predict patient response is only poorly understood. (3) The lack of standardized analysis pipelines and limited sharing of neoantigen data have hindered efficient and consistent research in the tumor immunogenomics field. Aim 1: Build a transfer learning-based model to predict immunogenicity of neoantigens. So far, only a very limited number of reports have created predictive models determining whether a neoantigen/MHC complex can elicit any T cell response. Even fewer of them are capable of predicting the TCR-binding specificity of neoantigens. However, the capability to predict the overall immunogenicity and the TCR-binding specificity of neoantigens is critical for improving the benefit of immunotherapy. Aim 1 addresses this challenge with advanced transfer learning algorithms, followed by benchmarking and laboratory validations. Aim 2: Predict response to checkpoint inhibitors by integration of the immunogenicity and other properties of all neoantigens in a patient, through a Bayesian multi-instance learning model. To date, most studies have focused on the neoantigen/mutation load approach in correlation with response of patients to immunotherapy administration. This simplistic approach misses the rich information contained in the whole repertoire of neoantigens per patient and has been successful in only a few studies, but not others. Aim 2 addresses this important inadequacy by creating a Bayesian multi-instance learning model that fully considers various quality features, including immunogenicity, of all neoantigens in a patient for prediction of treatment response. Aim 3: Create a web portal to provide neoantigen-related computational services and to share neoantigen data. The PI will establish a public webserver providing cloud-based standardized services, including prediction of neoantigens and the advanced analysis methods developed in Aim 1 and 2. The webserver will openly share neoantigen/TCR and patient phenotype data, in accordance with IRB and HIPAA regulations. Expected impact: (1) This project will predict the immunogenicity of neoantigens, which could inform neoantigen vaccine development. (2) This project will predict response to checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy based on patient neoantigen profiles. (3) The neoantigen database will propel research and also lead to clinical applications for cancers and other immune-related diseases, such as COVID-19. Project Narrative We will develop deep learning-based models to predict the TCR binding specificity of neoantigens/MHC complexes (immunogenicity). We will predict patient response to checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy based on immunogenicity and other properties of neoantigens. We will build a comprehensive neoantigen webserver, which will facilitate a coordinated effort to accelerate tumor immunogenomics research and clinical applications for personalized medicine.",Applying deep learning to predict T cell receptor binding specificity of neoantigens and response to checkpoint inhibitors,10180781,R01CA258584,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'COVID-19', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MHC antigen', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publications', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'data sharing networks', 'deep learning', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning algorithm', 'neglect', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'statistics', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vaccine development', 'web portal']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,378897
"Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment. Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate and an estimated 60,000 deaths/year by 2030. PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. While new systemic therapy regimens have improved survival, availability of multiple options, without tools to select an optimal regimen from these (on an individualized basis), has created a frustrating paradox in clinical decision-making. Due to a lack of personalized predictive tools, current standard of care treatment strategy is based on prognostic factors such as age, stage, performance status, serum albumin, etc. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options, on an individualized basis, to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment – before treatment – to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world. Our personalized medicine approach is unique and further enhanced by a commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University. The proposed project will build on recent work by our team including a patented (US 10,114,010B1) biomimetic in vitro platform for pharmacological transport and pancreatic microtissue tumor models. The commercial goal of this proposal is to identify best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. Our hypothesis is that response to treatment observed in POET will approximate the response in the corresponding patient. Our objective is to predict both effective and ineffective treatments for each patient prior to initiating treatment. We propose the following aims to achieve our objective: Aim 1: Calibrate and optimize POET for evaluating therapeutics using human PDAC cell-line xenografts for subsequent testing with patient tissue. Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of various systemic therapy agents in POET on an individualized basis to establish protocols and best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. We envision substantial continuing commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University including the integration of machine learning to derive a “POET Score” – a personalized quantitative efficacy score – based on a combination of factors. Data from POET and the POET Score will help clinical teams rank treatments for individual patients before the first drug infusion. If successful, this SBIR-driven study has the potential to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a positive impact around the world.

"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,10152531,U01CA232931,"['Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratory Research', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,625260
"A System for Xerostomia Risk Classification after Head & Neck Cancer Radiotherapy Summary Radiotherapy (RT) is a major component in the treatment of most head and neck cancer (HNC) cases. During irradiation, sensitive regions such as the salivary glands can sustain injury, resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth). This side effect is common and can significantly reduce quality of life during and post-treatment. The focus of this application is prediction during treatment planning of whether patients will suffer high-grade xerostomia (NCI CTCAE Grade 2-3) at the time of their first post-treatment follow-up visit, typically 3-6 months after RT (prevalence is approximately 40%). Predictions will enable clinicians to carry out treatment planning with improved knowledge of the likelihood of high-grade xerostomia development and allow better-informed and more timely anticipation of consequences such as eating difficulty. In this Phase 1 project, Oncospace Inc. will develop a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) prediction model using over 1200 complete HNC patient records. Associations between high-grade xerostomia and a wide range of dosimetric, clinical and demographic features will be automatically discovered and the features with the strongest associations will populate the nodes of a decision tree. The terminal leaf nodes will each contain the probability of high-grade xerostomia for the subset of patients in that node. In addition, leaf nodes will be assigned binary class labels designating a high- or low risk of high-grade xerostomia. This type of model provides transparency and interpretability, which are beneficial for clinical acceptance and for demonstration of safety to regulatory agencies. The software will be built using the Microsoft Azure cloud architecture and be deployed via a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. There are three distinct aims of this project:  1. Populate Oncospace Inc.’s Microsoft Azure CosmosDB database with data licensed from Johns Hopkins  University, including steps such as patient de-identification, data curation, and additional dataset feature engineering  2. Perform CART modeling and test model accuracy, using separate training and test datasets and a variety  of performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and F1-score.  3. Design a clinically acceptable risk classification strategy and a user interface (UI) to communicate model  results. Expert input from a team of UI consultants and three radiation oncologists will be an integral part  of the development, testing, and evaluation processes. The successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the clinical and commercial feasibility of a xerostomia prediction model for HNC. Further development in Phase 2 will include deeper model personalization via incorporation of advanced image features (radiomics), as well as validation of model generalizability and commercial viability via the curation and use in model building of data from other institutions. Oncospace, formed in 2018, is uniquely positioned to carry out this work as the team includes the creators of the Pinnacle radiation therapy planning system, Tomotherapy radiation treatment delivery system, and HealthMyne Quantitative Imaging Decision Support platform. Oncospace has close clinical collaboration with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for clinical feedback, validation and initial deployment.

"Development of quantitative tools to predict patients with difficult intubation to minimize treatment related complications ABSTRACT Endotracheal mouth/nose breathing need 10% this to performing subjective poorly standard Unfortunately, these airway examination systems in clinical practice perform only modestly, with sensitivities of 20-62%, specificities of 82-97%, and very low positive predictive values, generally less than 30%, unless very liberal definitions of difficulty are used. There are likely a number of reasons for this poor performance, including the relative rarity of difficult intubation, the multifactorial etiology and varying definition of difficult intubation, inter-observer variability in test results, failure to validate potential systems in patients independent of those used to derive the test, and the inadequacy of the tests themselves. intubation (EI) is a common medical procedure in which a plastic tube is introduced via the into the trachea, to provide respiratory support during general anesthesia or to ameliorate difficulty in cases of respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or other forms of critical illness. The global for EI is likely at least 150 million based on the WHO estimate of surgical need worldwide. Approximately  of EI attempts are difficult, and approximately 1/2000 are deemed impossible.

"Collaborative multi-site project to speed the identification and management of rare genetic immune diseases Summary  The subject of this proposal is a new, collaborative approach to improve the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). These patients have individually rare, monogenic disorders leading to severe infections, autoimmunity, and inflammation. The prevalence of PIDs is ~1:10,000 and approximately half have antibody deficiencies as their main immunological phenotype. Most doctors are unaware of these diseases and many patients go years without a diagnosis, costing the system tens of thousands of dollars per patient yearly and unnecessarily increasing morbidity and mortality. There is a tremendous, untapped opportunity to advance the diagnosis of patients with PIDs.  We propose to utilize new machine-learning approaches to algorithmically identify patients with PIDs from their electronic health records (EHR). To accomplish our goals, we have built a coalition of computational genomics groups at UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt (Computational team), and clinical immunology groups at the five University of California medical centers (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Irvine, San Diego, and Davis) (Immunology team). We propose to: Identify patients with rare immune diseases by phenotype risk scoring (Aim 1). We will speed the identification of patients with rare immune diseases by surveilling the EHR using a phenotype risk scoring approach, building upon recently published work in Science. We will apply this approach to the UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt clinical data repositories to identify potential cases. We will improve risk scoring by considering gender, age, and race/ethnicity. We will classify patients by whether they have an infection phenotype or immune dysregulation phenotype. Subsequently, we will expand to the larger, UC Health-wide Data Warehouse (UCHWDW), entailing 15+ million patients across all UC medical centers. We will then Identify the genetic immune diseases for these newly found subjects (Aim 2). We will follow the state-of-the-art approach employed by the UCLA and Vanderbilt Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) sites. We will start by sequencing all the known antibody deficiency patients across the Immunology team sites while collaboratively pre-reviewing identified cases from Aim 1 on monthly video-calls. For selected subjects, we will perform whole genome and RNA sequencing. Clinical and research laboratory testing will bring closure to the diagnostic odyssey for these subjects.  The overall impact of this work accelerates the diagnosis and cure of PIDs. This project will also serve as a demonstration of how immunology sites can work together sharing electronic medical records and genomic data to advance care. Narrative A major challenge for patients with immune diseases is the delay in diagnosis that leads to morbidity and mortality. This proposal combines teams from the five medical centers of the University of California and Vanderbilt to apply advanced computational, machine-learning approaches to identify patients with genetic immunodeficiency diseases.

"Patient-Centered Serious Games for Remote Cognitive Training in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment Project Summary/Abstract Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is characterized by cognitive decline greater than expected from normal aging, which does not yet significantly interfere with the performance of activities of daily living. The therapeutic goal for MCI is to slow down the course of the disease progress and reduce the impact of clinical symptoms. There has also been a particular emphasis on non-pharmacological interventions because they can slow disease progression and are low cost, non-invasive, safe, and have no adverse side effects. Serious games have received great interests among researchers and clinicians as a promising, low-cost, non- pharmacological intervention tool that can help assess and train patients’ cognitive function in a variety of environments (e.g., in/outside the clinic). Serious games in healthcare represent digital applications focusing on educating, informing, and enhancing patients’ health by leveraging the entertainment components of video games. However, currently available solutions require substantial involvement of trained caregivers and clinicians to motivate patients to adhere to the intervention protocol, which acts as the key barrier to the widespread implementations of serious game-based interventions. To bridge these gaps, this project aims to develop a mobile-health (mHealth) technology designed to encourage the use of, and thereby maximizing the compliance to, serious game-based training in individuals with MCI outside the clinic. We plan to employ a tablet-based application – namely Neuro-World – composed of six serious games designed to stimulate working memory and selective attention, which is developed by our research team’s industrial partner. Fully leveraging the system’s ability to provide clinically meaningful insights related to patients’ cognitive performance from their gameplays, their progress over time, and their compliance behaviors (e.g., use frequency and duration), it is our ultimate research goal to develop an optimal, human-centered serious game platform that can motivate patients’ to better adhere to the technological regimen. To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on evaluating the preliminary efficacy of our serious games as a training tool to improve cognitive function. We will perform a small single-blind randomized controlled trial in 50 individuals with MCI who will be randomized either to the intervention group or the control group. In Aim 2, we will develop machine learning-based algorithms to derive clinically meaningful information regarding cognitive function from the game performance. Aim 3 will finally investigate the optimal design of the mHealth system to maximize patients’ compliance with serious game-based training via human-centered design approaches. We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable self- administered, serious game-based cognitive training, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management. Project Narrative Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is characterized by cognitive decline greater than expected from normal aging. Serious games have received great interests from researchers and clinicians as a promising, low-cost, non- pharmacological intervention tool that can complement the conventional therapeutic programs to help assess and rehabilitate patients' functional impairments in many environments (e.g., clinics, long-term care facilities, patients' homes).

"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,10144423,R01DK120367,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Carbohydrates', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modification', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'arm', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes distress', 'engineering design', 'expectation', 'falls', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation design', 'improved', 'in silico', 'patient population', 'primary outcome', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'risk mitigation', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,592875
"Predicting Outcomes in Children with Ulcerative Colitis Summary/Abstract Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic intestinal disorder, a type of inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD). UC causes abdominal pain, diarrhea, bleeding and weight loss. Each year there are about 38,000 new UC cases with about 25-30% being children. UC is often more severe in children than adults. There is no standard regimen for managing all people with UC. Treatment of UC includes 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics and surgery to remove the colon. Ideally a personalized medicine approach should be taken to tailor therapy to the individual patient based on their disease severity and predicted response. However, there is currently a lack of guidance to clinicians as to which children are going to do well with these medications and who needs more medication exposure or surgery. To address this important issue, a clinical trial of standardized medical therapy was launched enrolling 428 children newly diagnosed with UC at 29 pediatric medical centers in North America (Predicting Response to Standardized Pediatric Colitis Therapy: The PROTECT Study). The PROTECT study collected clinical, genetic, environment and immune factors along with biospecimens including blood, stool, and colonic tissue. It was anticipated that a combination of clinical, genetic, and immunologic tests performed at diagnosis can construct a valuable predictive model for personalized medicine which can be implemented to improve clinical outcomes such as early and late remission on 5-ASA only without the concurrent use of steroid medications. Along this line, state-of-art machine learning algorithms can ultimately utilize the PROTECT study data and more accurately predict clinical outcomes. The ability to develop accurate predictive models using basic clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and laboratory data would be extremely helpful to clinicians, as well as to patients/families in helping them better understand the decision making process. ML-based models will be validated with external electronic health records data. Further, there is a lack of easy- to-use clinical decision support tool to help clinicians make decisions in the ﬁeld. This study will ﬁll the gap. Project Narrative The proposed project will accurately predict early and late clinical outcomes of patients following initial standard therapy in children with ulcerative colitis.

"Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers ABSTRACT  Gynecologic cancers are among the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide. These patients typically are socioeconomically disadvantaged, with poor access to screening and vaccination. Consequently, they often present with locoregionally advanced disease, for which pelvic radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent cisplatin (i.e., chemoradiotherapy) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of treatment failure. Intensifying treatment through the delivery of chemotherapy doublets, either concurrently or as adjuvant therapy following chemoradiotherapy, is a promising strategy to improve outcomes. However, the delivery of intensive chemotherapy is complicated by high rates of gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoradiotherapy are needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue including bowel, bone marrow, bone, bladder, and rectum, leading to preventable radiation-induced toxicity. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) can improve target localization and dosimetry, optimizing target dose while minimizing dose to surrounding normal tissues. However, IGRT can be highly resource intensive, and comparative effectiveness trials have been lacking. For this reason, there is considerable controversy as to the utility of IG-IMRT in this disease. Our research group has been at the forefront of developing novel, cost-effective IGRT approaches with wide potential to facilitate better delivery of concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy.  Previously we have found that radiation-induced injury to hematopoietically active bone marrow is a critical determinant of tolerance to intensive chemotherapy. Using machine learning methods, we recently developed a multi-atlas-based IGRT method that can predict canonical distributions of active bone marrow, which can obviate the need for positron emission tomography (PET) in settings where this technology is unavailable or unaffordable. The proposed new research will study the ability of multi-atlas-based IGRT to reduce hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to standard treatment, using data from 450 patients enrolled to a randomized phase III trial (NRG-GY006). Furthermore, we will use serial whole body PET/CT to study the impact of radiation dose and chemotherapy intensity on the compensatory hematopoietic response, and have developed novel whole body radiomics biomarkers to quantify the inflammatory state, which we hypothesize can influence patients' outcomes and tolerance to chemotherapy.  The new research extends our work associated with a current R01 grant (1R01CA197059-01) to conduct correlative science associated with the GY006 trial. The overarching goal of this research line is to augment the therapeutic ratio of chemoradiotherapy for pelvic cancers using advanced image-guided radiation techniques. If successful, this research would significantly alter the approach to the treatment of many pelvic malignancies for which chemoradiotherapy is standard. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this study, we will test the ability of a novel method called multi-atlas-based image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) to reduce acute hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to conventional RT, which could obviate the need for expensive functional imaging in socioeconomically disadvantaged and resource constrained populations, such as patients with gynecologic cancers. In addition, we will use serial positron emission tomography to study effects of chemotherapy and radiation on the subacute compensatory hematopoietic response, and will seek to develop and validate novel whole body radiomics models of the inflammatory state as predictive biomarkers for gynecologic cancers. We are in an optimal situation to conduct impactful and innovative research in the context of an ongoing phase III cooperative group randomized registration trial (NRG GY006), affording us the opportunity to conduct rigorous correlative science on a large sample with high data quality, quality assurance, and carefully controlled treatment effects.",Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers,10108128,R01CA255780,"['Acute', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Cisplatin', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Intestines', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Cancer', 'Pelvis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'bone', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data quality', 'dosimetry', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image-guided radiation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predictive marker', 'quality assurance', 'radiation-induced injury', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'whole body imaging']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,276286
"Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disease characterized by pancreatic beta destruction with subsequent insulin depletion. The alterations in glucose dynamics are incredibly difficult to manage and are confounded by meals, exercise, menstruation, and stress. Although automated insulin delivery systems are becoming commercially available, the large majority of people with T1D are treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI). Dangerous complications of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis can occur from failure to dose insulin correctly, however vigilant adherence to tedious insulin dosing strategies are difficult for MDI users maintain. This difficulty is magnified during exercise, which is critical to ameliorating long-term complications of diabetes; even when guidelines for insulin dosage adjustments are followed, acute hypoglycemia during exercise and night-time hypoglycemia can occur. In our recent survey of 1400 subjects living with T1D, the majority of subjects on MDI therapy were not confident in managing their glucose during exercise and felt they lacked tools to do so. In aggregate, difficult treatment schedules and bolus calculations, associated acute complications from daily activities, and the emotional and psychological toll of this chronic disease can result in treatment non-adherence and poor glycemic outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for decision support tools designed for MDI users to improve glycemic control surrounding meals, daily activities and exercise. The goal of this proposal to develop a decision support tool for patients with type 1 diabetes who utilize continuous glucose monitoring systems and multiple daily injection therapy. This tool will be called miTREAT, the multiple injection treatment recommender system for exercise-aware therapies. We hypothesize that use of a novel decision support tool equipped with content-based collaborative filtering methods and dynamic exercise hypoglycemia prediction algorithms will improve overall euglycemia and reduce time spent in hypoglycemia for patients on MDI therapy. In our first aim, we will leverage decades of research in computer science recommender systems and machine learning optimization strategies to develop a novel decision support system that identifies issues in glycemic control and recommends appropriate insulin dose and behavioral modifications. In our second aim, we will develop a new exercise model that reflects both the dynamics of rapid-uptake of glucose through GLUT-4 channels and the longitudinal biphasic insulin sensitivity profile. This new model structure will be used to predict hypoglycemia during and after the exercise period. In our third aim, we will explore the performance of our decision support engine in an in-vivo clinical trial. This clinical trial will assess the usability of a new smart-phone app designed to assist MDI users that we have developed at OHSU. In achieving these goals, we will develop the first decision support system that provides treatment and behavioral recommendations to patients on CGM-augmented MDI therapy. This system will improve overall time in euglycemia, and reduce the occurrence of acute complications surrounding exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 Diabetes is difficult to manage through multiple daily injections, and there is a paucity of tools available to assist patients with treatment decisions. In this proposal, the fields of computer science, machine learning, constrained optimization and clinical science are united to develop a novel decision support tool for multiple daily injection users. This is accomplished in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes,10126842,F31DK121436,"['Acute', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Assimilations', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Cutaneous', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical Technology', 'Menstruation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Running', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Study Subject', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'computer science', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'dosage', 'e-commerce', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'glucose disposal', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose uptake', 'glycemic control', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insulin sensitivity', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'resistance exercise', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,51036
"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision making.",Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling,10217235,K23HL144907,"['Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioprosthesis device', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronology', 'Citric Acid Cycle', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Israel', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physician Executives', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve replacement', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'end of life', 'frailty', 'health data', 'health service use', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'mid-career faculty', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'surgical risk', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2021,172800
"Novel Cardiac MRI-Based Predictors for Tetralogy of Fallot: Deformation, Kinematic, and Geometric Analyses Five to 10% of patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) die before age 30, but our ability to predict which patients will experience death, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (DVTF) is limited. The optimal timing of pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), which may delay DVTF, is also not clear. The current best predictors of DVTF and guidance for PVR timing rely on “traditional” measures such as right ventricular volume and ejection fraction, which are derived from cardiac MRI (CMR). However, even the best DVTF models have limited predictive power, and these “traditional” volumetric measures fail to predict appropriate response to PVR for 30-40% of patients. This proposal aims to address the critical need for CMR based- metrics that correlate with DVTF and predict response to PVR better than traditional ventricular volumetrics. This will be accomplished through the development of ventricular deformation-, kinematic-, and geometry- based mechanics metrics for rTOF patients from routinely acquired, standard of care CMR datasets, which would allow rapid implementation in clinical practice. The critical need will be addressed through two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Develop and evaluate novel CMR-based predictors of clinical outcomes in patients with rTOF. Specific Aim 2: Prospectively assess ventricular geometry-based predictors of response to pulmonary valve replacement in rTOF patients. The rationale is that if computational modeling techniques can generate metrics that outperform traditional markers, they can be used to change current patient management with the eventual goal to delay DVTF. The failure to develop improved metrics will lead to continued excess mortality and suboptimal clinical outcomes for patients with rTOF. The combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches allows a more comprehensive assessment of CMR metrics in a population where randomized controlled trials are not feasible. This work has the potential for rapid implementation and thus to mark a paradigm shift in the use of computational modeling in clinical cardiology. The candidate’s career goal is to be an independent investigator leading multidisciplinary research teams to develop new, more accurate, and easily applied outcome predictors for congenital heart disease (CHD). This would place him at the nexus of clinical pediatric cardiology, biomedical engineering, and computer science. To achieve this goal, he will learn about machine learning and kinematic analyses, their strengths and pitfalls, and the data characteristics needed for these analyses. He will learn how to bring his findings to clinical practice and design studies using the newly developed metrics. He will then design R01-funded research to prospectively assess the performance of the ventricular mechanical metrics to guide PVR and predict DVTF. This will all be accomplished through a dedicated, multi-disciplinary mentor/advisor team, a supportive academic environment, and didactic and hands-on training. At the completion of this training, the applicant plans to be a world leader in the application of advanced imaging analytics for congenital heart disease. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because patients with tetralogy of Fallot, the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease affecting ~1:2500 babies, have increased risk of heart failure and premature death despite excellent initial surgery. Development of non-invasive, easily obtained, and rapidly implemented metrics of ventricular mechanics are needed to improve prediction of death and allow optimization of pulmonary valve replacement timing. This project is relevant to the NHLBI’s mission because the tools developed here, and the skills learned, could then be applied to other forms of congenital and structural heart disease, and promote longer and more fulfilling lives for patients.","Novel Cardiac MRI-Based Predictors for Tetralogy of Fallot: Deformation, Kinematic, and Geometric Analyses",10127094,K23HL150279,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac development', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'EFRAC', 'Environment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Function', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tetralogy of Fallot', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'congenital heart disorder', 'design', 'early experience', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'premature', 'prospective', 'pulmonary valve replacement', 'repaired', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'structural heart disease', 'tool', 'vector']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2021,169351
"A Personalized, Patient-Centered Approach to Optimizing Lupus Care Candidate: April Jorge, MD is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and an Assistant in Medicine in the Rheumatology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). After graduating from the University of Maryland magna cum laude, she received her MD from Georgetown University, and she completed her internal medicine residency at Northwestern University. She completed her rheumatology fellowship at MGH, during which she also completed the Harvard Catalyst Clinical and Translational Research Academy and began working with Hyon Choi, MD, DrPH. Dr. Jorge's prior work has resulted in 15 peer- reviewed original papers, with 13 as the first author or co-first author. Her goal is to become an independent investigator and innovative leader in patient-oriented research of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Mentorship, Training Activities, and Environment: Dr. Jorge will conduct the proposed project at MGH under the mentorship of Hyon Choi, MD, DrPH and co-mentorship of Karen Costenbader, MD, MPH and Karen Sepucha, PhD. Dr. Choi is a world-renowned, NIH-funded physician scientist in advanced clinical epidemiology of rheumatic conditions, ranging from common disorders to rare but serious disorders (e.g., SLE). He has served as a mentor for several prior K awardees. Dr. Costenbader is a clinical investigator and expert in SLE who is also an experienced mentor of K awardees. Dr. Sepucha is a leading expert in patient-centered decision science. Dr. Jorge's research will also benefit from the specific expertise of her key collaborators, including advanced clinical epidemiology methods, machine learning prediction algorithms, and decision- analytic modeling. In addition to receiving excellent mentorship, she will acquire new skills through didactics in advanced clinical epidemiology and pharmacoepidemiology, risk prediction, eliciting patient preferences with a mixed methods research approach, and decision-analytic modeling. Research: SLE carries increased risks of multiple comorbidities and double the risk of death compared to the general population. Current treatment is limited in part by few proven medications and adverse treatment effects. The central goal of this research is to improve long-term SLE outcomes by integrating personalized risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient-centered use of key lupus medications. To achieve this goal, she will risk stratify patients for potential harms of treatment, i.e., hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection with belimumab use versus other immunosuppressants, and other adverse outcomes, i.e., severe COVID-19 infection (Aim 1). She will elicit patient preferences for SLE treatment through a discrete choice experiment (Aim 2a) and will integrate patient preferences with personalized risks through a multi-criteria decision analysis to determine the optimal hydroxychloroquine dose in SLE care (Aim 2b). Completion of this proposal and training plan will position Dr. Jorge with the vital experience to become an independent clinical investigator in patient-oriented research of SLE. Project Narrative Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous systemic condition associated with serious morbidity and premature mortality, yet treatment options are limited. There is uncertainty regarding the optimal use of the two FDA-approved lupus medications, hydroxychloroquine and belimumab, due in part to the risks of adverse treatment effects including hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection. This Career Development Award focuses on applying advanced clinical epidemiology and patient-centered decision science to integrate personalized risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient- centered use of key lupus medications, including specifically the optimal dose of hydroxychloroquine in SLE care.","A Personalized, Patient-Centered Approach to Optimizing Lupus Care",10192142,K23AR079040,"['Academy', 'Adverse effects', 'Award', 'Azathioprine', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fellowship', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harm Reduction', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Internal Medicine', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maryland', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycophenolate', 'Ophthalmology', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Premature Mortality', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Residencies', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'belimumab', 'care outcomes', 'catalyst', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'data access', 'dosage', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'renal damage', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'severe COVID-19', 'skills', 'therapy adverse effect', 'trend']",NIAMS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,174960
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),10141287,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,652539
"AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hearing loss, visual impairment, and in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. It is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness in humans. USH causes extensive degeneration in the cochlear nerve (CN), especially in CN fibers innervating the base of the cochlea. Whereas there is no treatment for arresting this degenerative process or for restoring visual loss, the restoration of auditory input is possible with cochlear implantation. Due to the progressive deterioration in vision, using visual cues for communication will eventually become impossible. Therefore, the importance of optimizing auditory inputs through cochlear implants (CIs) for patients with USH is paramount. However, patients with USH have much higher rates of neurological, mental, or behavioral disorders than the general CI patient population, which limits their ability to provide reliable behavioral responses or sufficient verbal descriptions of their auditory perception, especially for pediatric patients. In addition, optimal programming parameters for CI users with CN damage differ from those used in typical CI users due to declined CN responsiveness to electrical stimulation. As a result, the clinical programming process in implanted patients with USH can be extremely challenging. To date, auditory neural encoding of electrical stimulation in patients with USH has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, the field lacks evidence-based practice guidelines for managing implanted patients with USH. For patients who cannot provide reliable feedback, clinicians rely on a “trial-and-error” approach for adjusting CI programming settings, which ultimately may not result in appropriate programming maps for individual patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop objective clinical tools for optimizing CI settings for these patients. As the first step toward developing evidence-based practice for managing patients with USH, this study evaluates local neural health, as well as the neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN in implanted patients with USH. Aim 1 will determine local CN health in patients with USH by assessing the sensitivity of the electrically evoked compound action potential to changes in interphase gap and pulse polarity. Aim 2 will determine group differences in neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN between patients with USH and patients with idiopathic hearing loss. Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning techniques to develop an objective tool for assessing the electrode-neuron interface at individual electrode locations. Results of this study have high scientific significance because they will establish how CN degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, and identify tests that distinguish the loss of spiral ganglion neurons from the loss of peripheral axons. Results of this study also have high clinical significance because they will 1) lay the groundwork for developing effective, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for managing patients with USH, and 2) yield an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neuron interface in all CI users, which is foundational for creating optimal programming maps for individual patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health because it aims to better understand neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation in patients with Usher syndrome (USH) – an autosomal recessive disorder that is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness. Results from this study will have a broad impact on the field by 1) establishing how cochlear nerve degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, 2) identifying tests that distinctly evaluate the loss in the spiral ganglion cells vs the loss in the peripheral axon, and 3) yielding an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neural interface in all cochlear implant users. Results from this study will also have a targeted impact on implanted patients with USH by laying the groundwork for developing an effective, evidence-based clinical practice for managing these patients.

"Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), resulting from drug exposure, infection or autoimmune disease, is the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in up to 20% of patients who undergo a kidney biopsy. Even though we currently have 2 clinical interventions available to treat patients with AIN (withdrawal of the offending drug and corticosteroids), 40-60% of patients with AIN go on to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) even when appropriately treated. Kidney damage in AIN is believed to result from immune-mediated tubular injury that eventually leads to fibrosis and permanent kidney damage.  The recent dileniation of the immune underpinnings of multiple autoimmune diseases and cancers has led to the development of targeted therapies that exhibit improved efficacy and less toxicity compared to corticosteroids. Therefore, an analysis of the immune infiltrate and resulting resident cell (tubular and vascular) responses that provides pathogenic understanding of the specific immune events that initiate and propogate AIN should lead to development and/or repurposing of targeted therapies that are more effective at resolving AIN and preventing the progression to CKD, as well as potentially less toxic.  Data from several groups, including our own, suggest that CD4+ T-helper cells (particularly the TH2/TH9 subsets) are potential drivers of AIN. We have found that TH2/TH9 cytokines IL-5 and IL-9 and some cells of type 2 immunity, mast cells and eosinophils, are higher in the urine or kidneys of patients with AIN. Based on these data, it is our hypothesis that TH2/TH9 T-helper cells in the kidney itself play an important pathogenic role in promoting tubular or vascular injury in AIN. We will test this hypothesis by performing a quantitative evaluation of the kidney immune infiltrate and accompanying tubular and vascular response in humans with AIN. We will use existing kidney biopsies, adjudicated by 3 nephropathologists as exhibiting AIN, from two university health centers (Yale and Johns Hopkins), as discovery and validation cohorts for this study. To perform the quantitative analysis we will use an imaging technique called Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) that supports the simultaneous, spatially-preserved quantification of up to 42 antibodies on a single tissue section. We have an existing library of 27 validated kidney and immune antibodies and have developed a machine learning protocol to rapidly and accurately quantify and localize all cells in the human kidney identified using IMC.  We will first increase our validated antibody panel and optimize our IMC protocol for use in the study of AIN (SA 1). We will then use IMC to identify, quantify and localize the immune and resident cell responses in 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN control biopsies from Yale (discovery cohort), followed by 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN controls from JHU (validation cohort, SA 2). Finally, we will define the relationship between cellular determinants of AIN and recovery of kidney function as well as response to steroids (SA3). Our findings will not only lead to identification of novel druggable targets in AIN, but also lead to improving clinical histological diagnosis of AIN. Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of kidney dysfunction, and can lead to chronic kidney disease in many patients. We know that AIN occurs as an immune response in the kidney to certain drugs or infections, but do not have a clear understanding of the cell sources of the inflammation or the tubular and vascular responses. This proposal is designed to define these immune events in human kidney biopsy samples left over after clinical diagnosis has been completed, and to determine how they relate to the development of chronic kidney disease.",Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis,10264054,R01DK126815,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Delayed Hypersensitivity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Formalin', 'Health', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukin-9', 'Interstitial Nephritis', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Neighborhoods', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Tubular formation', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Withdrawal', 'adjudicate', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'eosinophil', 'exhaust', 'improved', 'injured', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney dysfunction', 'mast cell', 'multiphoton imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'renal damage', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'vascular injury']",NIDDK,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,528629
"Digital Therapeutic Development of Virtual Cognitive-Affective Training for Opioid Use Disorder Project Summary: The US is experiencing an opioid crisis, with an estimated 2.5 million Americans meeting full criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most effective form of intervention for OUD. In spite of the proven efficacy of MOUD, nearly half of people who begin a MOUD relapse within six months. As such, novel and efficacious behavioral adjuncts to MOUD are needed to improve treatment outcomes. Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a cognitive-affective training intervention generated through a NIDA-funded treatment development process has shown significant promise, demonstrating therapeutic effects in four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by reducing opioid use and misuse and modulating neurophysiological responses during drug cue-reactivity and natural reward processing. However, the MORE intervention requires significant human interaction and is therefore resource intensive. Further, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, people with OUD may be reticent to engage in face-to-face interventions due to the risk of viral spread. To overcome these implementation barriers and increase access to treatment, the proposed project will develop and test a virtual reality version of the MORE intervention (MORE-VR) built on BehaVR LLC's VR existing, commercially available platform, the Dynamic eXperience Engine (DXE). The DXE uses machine learning to integrate biometrics into the VR experience to personalize addictions treatment, boosting patient engagement and optimizing the efficacy of clinical intervention. In Phase I, we will develop and test the MORE-VR prototype in a single arm clinical study of OUD patients receiving buprenorphine in an opioid treatment program (OTP), focusing on patient safety and engagement. If the prototype is perceived to have adequate usability and Net Promoter Scores, as well as to produce improvements in proximal measures of craving and affective state, the project will progress to Phase II. In Phase II, we will first develop the MORE-VR Minimal Viable Program using feedback from our Phase I study to optimize the intervention, and then conduct a RCT of MORE-VR vs. MOUD treatment as usual. Our robust and unbiased research design will triangulate clinical outcome measurement with biochemical verification of abstinence, ecological momentary assessments (EMA), and neurophysiological assessment of cue-reactivity. Further, we will integrate the MORE-VR Program into the OTP operational environment, building Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources interfaces to ingest patient data from electronic medical records (EMRs) and to export patient utilization, assessment, and biometric data back to EMRs to create patient records and inform clinicians of patient progress. Activities in Phase I and Phase II will help define the regulatory pathway and establish regulatory feasibility to precede Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the MORE-VR system as a Class II medical device. In sum, this project will translate an evidence- based biobehavioral treatment approach into an innovative digital therapeutic for OUD. Project Narrative Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most effective form of intervention for opioid use disorder (OUD); however, novel behavioral adjuncts are needed to remediate dysregulation in brain reward systems, enhance MOUD adherence, and prevent relapse.

"A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network There is a substantial body of literature to support that biological and prosthetic complications occur which may interfere with the health of the peri-implant tissues, the function and esthetics of the implant restoration. Peri-implant diseases are classified into peri-implant mucositis, inflammation restricted to the peri-implant mucosa, and peri-implantitis, characterized by peri-implant bone loss. The limitations of the current body of literature of biologic and prosthetic complications are based on many small studies and in large part conducted in an academic and specialty setting. We propose to create an implant registry within the National Dental Practice Based Research Network (NDPBRN) that will record the setting and implant therapy, the implants used, the prosthetic therapy provided and the rate of complications. The registry will create an opportunity for subsequent, additional targeted studies on specific complications available from the registry data and will lead to diagnosis driven therapy strategies. The target enrollment is a total of 2000 implants with prosthesis across the whole network. The one year UG3 Phase will be used to create a strategy to be able to meet the recruitment and enrollment objectives and to develop the protocol for data collection to facilitate the data gathering of the practitioners for the subjects they enroll. The data collection model we propose will be designed to be validated, concise, and easy to use for practitioners. We will develop a web based decision tree that will guide the practitioner through the data collection. The UH3 phase will recruit practitioners with representation of all 6 regions of the network that will enroll subjects with 2000 implants. Data collection will be detailed and comprehensive and will include surgical, prosthetic, and biologic aspects of implant therapy and radiographs for bone level assessments for a period of 3 years. The data will present clinically meaningful information about the prevalence of the various implant therapies, the incidence of prosthetic and biologic implant complications, risk factors for implant complications and evidence-based implant therapy strategies in every dental practices. We expect that the results from this study will significantly impact the clinical practice of implant dentistry and the quality of care provided for the patients. We propose to create an Implant Registry capturing implant therapy that is provided by practitioners within the NDPBRN. The aim is to determine the therapies associated with the greatest amount of success and the least amount of complications. With the data generated through this registry, we will add to the generalizable knowledge about implant therapy, the complications and therapies associated with implant success at the fixture level and the patient level.",A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network,10101988,UG3DE030090,"['Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Implants', 'Dentistry', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Esthetics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral health', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Private Practice', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'data registry', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health related quality of life', 'medical specialties', 'peri-implant bone loss', 'peri-implantitis', 'personalized therapeutic', 'practice setting', 'practice-based research network', 'recruit', 'restoration', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,UG3,2021,202410
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,10141224,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data repository', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,129110
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,10152359,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2021,628779
"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication.

"Precision antimicrobial stewardship for Clostridioides difficile prevention (PASTCDI) Project Summary Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an important healthcare-associated infection and a significant driver of poor patient outcomes and preventable cost. An existing bundle of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) methods of CDI prevention are limited by difficulties identifying high-risk patients most likely to benefit from interventions. Recently we have developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately identify risk of developing CDI in hospitalized patients. Here we propose adding and rigorously testing this highly innovative precision medicine approach to CDI prevention within a robust, real-world AMS infrastructure Objective: To decrease CDI incidence by implementing an electronic health record-integrated CDI-risk classification tool within a framework of precision-medicine AMS. Specific Aim: Measure the effect of implementing a real-time CDI-risk classification tool to guide AMS efforts for CDI prevention among high-risk patients. The primary outcome will be hospital-associated CDI incidence. We will measure outcomes in patients identified as high-risk by the risk classification tool, comparing a 24- month pre-implementation period with a 12-month post-implementation period using interrupted time series (ITS) segmented regression. Secondary outcomes will include antimicrobial utilization rates, CDI test ordering, hospital length of stay, total cost, tool use, and AMS satisfaction Hypothesis: We hypothesize that tool implementation will result in a 35% relative reduction in CDI incidence, which aligns well with the lower end of estimates of bundle effect in prior studies. Significance: While evidence supports the efficacy of AMS interventions for CDI-prevention in general, our proposal is the first to our knowledge to employ a precision-medicine approach to CDI prevention. This high- impact, precision medicine proposal, based on extensive, sound preliminary data has a high probability of success. Project Narrative Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an epidemic in hospitalized patients, and current prevention strategies are limited by difficulties identifying patients most likely to benefit from interventions. We developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately estimating risk of CDI. This study will use the tool to target antimicrobial stewardship CDI-prevention bundle recommendations toward patients at highest risk who are missed by current case finding strategies and investigate whether this will decrease rates of CDI.",Precision antimicrobial stewardship for Clostridioides difficile prevention (PASTCDI),10208953,R03HS027208,[' '],AHRQ,"IHC HEALTH SERVICES, INC.",R03,2021,62445
"Early detection, containment, and management of COVID-19 in dialysis facilities using multi-modal data sources Abstract With older age and multiple comorbidities, dialysis patients are at high risk for serious complications, even death, from COVID-19. There is a large disproportionate representation of minorities, especially Blacks and Hispanics. Over 85% of hemodialysis patients travel three times a week to dialysis facilities to receive life-sustaining treatments and cannot shelter in place. There is a critical need to characterize COVID-19 transmission pathways in dialysis patients and clinics, identify potential coronavirus carriers, and develop procedures to curb the spread. With regular medical encounters, a large amount of data has been collected for each patient over time. These data have not been fully utilized for COVID-19 prediction and control in dialysis clinics. In this proposal, we seek to leverage demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, socioeconomic, serological, metabolomic, wearable and machine-integrated sensors, and COVID-19 surveillance data to develop mathematical and statistical models and implement them in a large number of dialysis clinics. The mathematical and statistical modeling using multiple data resources will help us understand how COVID-19 spread in dialysis facilities, identify potential COVID-19 patients before symptoms appear, and identify potential asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We will develop novel mathematical and statistical models that fully utilize the high dimensional multimodal data available to us and other dialysis providers. We capitalize on the intrinsic advantages of hemodialysis clinics to implement and validate the proposed prediction models. We firmly believe that this cross-disciplinary effort will improve patients’ and staff’s safety while delivering high-quality, individualized care to a high-risk population. Narrative Dialysis patients are at high risk for serious complications, even death, from COVID-19.

"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,10151599,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human Characteristics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling Biases', 'Self Administration', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'hormone therapy', 'human subject', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'patient engagement', 'patient portal', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'side effect', 'social cognitive theory', 'text searching', 'treatment adherence', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2021,386906
"Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics ABSTRACT As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable (angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of resistant HTN—namely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans develop hypertension and its co-morbidities at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of hypertension, have poorer control of blood pressure, and die disproportionately (2-fold) more from hypertension as compared to whites. Despite these known disparities, there has been little attention or advancement in the management of blood pressure in the African American population. Our laboratory’s advanced physiological model paired with novel analytic tools may mechanistically predict the types of patients that should respond to therapy, ultimately improving patient drug regimens and their success rate in this underserved and understudied population.",Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics,10268976,K99MD014738,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aldosterone Antagonists', 'Angiotensin II', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Attention', 'Baroreflex', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calcium Channel', 'Cardiac Output', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Diuretics', 'Endocrine', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Peripheral Resistance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistant Hypertension', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sodium Chloride', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer generated', 'data warehouse', 'experimental study', 'genetic epidemiology', 'human model', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'physiologic model', 'relating to nervous system', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model', 'virtual patient']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,K99,2021,101117
"Towards autonomous management of cardiogenic shock Project Summary  Physicians in the cardiac intensive care unit (CCU) make decisions in an increasingly data- and knowledge- rich world, yet often they get little help. Currently, each physician makes decisions based on his or her mental model of the patient’s physiology, together with mental predictions of the patient’s response to intervention. This approach can lead to a range of behaviors that compromise patient outcomes, including oversimplification of the physiology, errors due to cognitive overload, and physician to physician variability in decision making. A computational tool equipped with quantitative knowledge of physiology, the ability to systematically evaluate all the data, and informed by a database of past action-outcome events could aid the physician with valuable suggestions for action.  We propose to train an algorithm to make decisions about dosing vasoactive medications and initiating mechanical support in patients with cardiogenic shock due to decompensated heart failure. This focused set of decisions entails calculations about the physiology that are normally performed in a physician’s head. We frame the decision problem as optimizing cardiovascular function to preserve oxygen delivery, and we apply tools from optimal control. Rather than hand-design a CCU controller we will use reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to “fit” one. The field of RL has experienced explosive growth over the past few years, with notable advances in strategic decision problems and robotics. A key challenge in the clinical environment is that the exploration phase of learning (“trial and error”) would be unethical in real patients. A second challenge is that the availability of patient data, while growing, is likely to be a bottleneck. We will leverage state-of-the-art model-based RL to train an algorithm using a combination of simulation and off-policy learning from historical data. We will use a model of cardiovascular physiology that underlies cardiac simulators in use today for the training of cardiologists. Historical patient data will come from the Massachusetts General Hospital Clinical Data Animation Center which has recorded real-time telemetry waveform data in addition to standard electronic medical record data from all CCU patients spanning several years. This is one of the largest and most complete datasets of its kind. The complexity of managing cardiogenic shock will continue to escalate as tools become more sophisticated and patients live longer, with more extensive comorbidities. Advanced decision support tools could help tame this complexity, improving the quality of care as well as democratizing it. Project Narrative The sickest cardiac patients are treated in the intensive care unit and are complex to manage. We aim to create a tool that will use artificial intelligence to study a patient's data and offer a physician advice. Our goal is to improve the patient's chance of survival and shorten their time in intensive care.",Towards autonomous management of cardiogenic shock,10218696,R21EB030756,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Aviation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiogenic Shock', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Rewards', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'animation', 'base', 'cardiac intensive care unit', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital health', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'patient response', 'preservation', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unethical']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2021,252000
"Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations PROJECT SUMMARY  Large confirmatory or pragmatic clinical trials enroll patients from multiple centers to obtain high-quality evidence useful for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. The design of multicenter trials is particularly appealing to policymakers because many tend to be pragmatic and offer access to a large sample of diverse patient populations. Decision-makers trying to use the results of multicenter trials have specific target populations in mind. Yet, selection at both the center and individual participant level challenges the ability of even well-designed and conducted multicenter trials to draw inferences about any meaningful target population. These selection mechanisms, even in impeccably conducted multicenter trials, result in samples of trial participants that are not representative of any specific target population. When treatment effects are heterogeneous over covariates that are differentially distributed across centers, the overall trial average treatment effect estimate will not apply to any one of the populations underlying the participating centers or the target population. Consider for example, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a large multicenter trial of 33 centers (53,456 individuals) across the United States, which motivated this proposal. Because the positive benefits of screening are mainly concentrated in individuals at high-risk for lung cancer it is critical that individuals are appropriately targeted for screening recommendations. Our long-term objective is to optimize the applicability of trial results into clinical practice. We will take steps toward this objective by achieving the following specific aims: (1) Develop robust and efficient statistical methods, that can be combined with modern machine learning techniques, to reinterpret a multicenter trial in the context of each of the participating centers and to transport inferences from a multicenter trial to a new target population; (2) Evaluate the performance of methods developed in Aim 1 in simulation studies that reflect real-world data by considering scenarios with different sample sizes, number of centers, treatment effects, and outcome or selection mechanisms; (3) Apply the methods in the NLST to reinterpret the trial in the context of one of the participating centers and to transport trial findings to a new target population using baseline data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the United States general population. The proposed work is innovative for analyzing multicenter trials because it develops new methods, clarifies the assumptions needed for obtaining valid inference, and empirically assesses method performance. This work is significant because as a result of applying these methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials. Insights gained from this work will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. Selection bias at both the individual and center level challenge the applicability of trial findings to populations often underrepresented in trials, such as women, ethnic/racial minorities, or the elderly. This work aligns with AHRQ’s mission and priority areas because as a result of applying these proposed methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying target populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials, where decisions must be made.",Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations,10228266,R36HS028373,[' '],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R36,2021,43083
"IMProving Outcomes Related to Patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT) Although healthcare costs in the United States rank among the highest in the world, critical health outcomes rank lower than other high resource countries. In an effort to improve healthcare quality and concomitantly reduce costs, Congress identified certain serious and expensive but preventable hospital acquired conditions such as patient falls, pressure ulcer injuries (PUI) and hospital acquired infections (HAI), that would no longer be reimbursed by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. These preventable adverse events have been linked with nursing time with patients. Nurses play a critical role in preventing adverse outcomes by quickly identifying patients at risk, evaluating the extent of these risks, and acting upon the changing status of the patient, a process termed “nurse surveillance.” Hence, nurses are key contributors to overall patient surveillance and safety. The Joint Commission recommends that the nurses give report at the patient bedside, termed “bedside shift report” (BSR), to reduce errors and improve continuity of care; hourly rounds (HR) are also recommended to reduce falls; both of these measures contribute to nurse surveillance of patients, but their relationship to patient outcomes remains understudied. NewYork-Presbyterian, a large academic health system, is piloting an innovative technology called “iN,” to improve BSR and HR through the use of color-changing lights and integrated mobile app to remind nurses when these activities have not been completed. This technology uses a combination of mounted hardware in the patient room with obfuscated computer vision to provide constant surveillance of the patient room and companion software supplied via a mobile phone app that integrates these technologies. This novel intervention to increase BSR and HR by nurses, which generates detailed process data, offers an unprecedented opportunity to gain a complete understanding of all activities that take place at the bedside and yet has not yet been studied to characterize nurse surveillance or to assess associations with related patient outcomes. The IMProving Outcomes Related to patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT) study will characterize nurse surveillance and its influence on patient falls, HAI, and PUI to generate new knowledge about factors that influence these nurse-sensitive patient outcomes. Using the dataset built in this study that will integrate data from the iN device, electronic health record, staffing and census data, and hospital reported quality measures on falls, HAI and PUIs, this prospective cohort study design will use descriptive statistics and a Cox-proportional hazard model to characterize nurse surveillance and the contribution of BSR and HR to nurse surveillance to generate predictive indicators of these nurse-sensitive outcomes (falls, PUIs HAIs), which can be used to identify intervention targets. The IMPORTANT study addresses AHRQ’s specific priorities to conduct “Research to improve health care patient safety,” and “Harness data and technology to improve healthcare quality and patient outcomes and to provide a 360-degree view of the patient” and will address AHRQ priority populations of the those with multiple chronic conditions, minorities, and women. Project Narrative This “IMProving Outcomes Related to patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT)” study will explore an innovative technology that will capture information about a technology-enabled intervention to improve nurse surveillance and subsequent nurse-sensitive patient outcomes: patient falls, pressure ulcer injury, and hospital acquired infections. This study will provide an enhanced understanding of nursing interactions with patients at the bedside and subsequent effects on related patient outcomes through the use of both existing data and novel technology.",IMProving Outcomes Related to Patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT),10131779,R03HS027006,[' '],AHRQ,HUNTER COLLEGE,R03,2021,51444
"Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout Gout is a highly prevalent, painful inflammatory arthritis, caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Gout flares cause impaired quality of life and physical function, leading to lost work days, disability, high healthcare costs. Patients with gout are also known to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), kidney disease, and mortality. Previous studies suggest a potential beneficial effect of urate-lowering therapy on the risk of CVD and renal function. Over the past decade, the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid (SUA) level below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, based on the upper limit of water solubility of uric acid under normal physiologic circumstances. However, the 2016 American College of Physicians (ACP)’ guidelines for gout management recommend use of urate-lowering therapy but support a ‘treat-to-avoid symptoms’ strategy without monitoring SUA rather than the TTT strategy because of ‘inconclusive’ evidence in the literature. Such discrepancies in treatment guidelines from various societies urge the need for comparative effectiveness research of the treatment strategies for gout.  Rigorous epidemiologic studies utilizing high-quality observational data from electronic health records (EHR) or insurance claims databases can be an important tool for comparative effectiveness research. The primary objective of this 3-year proposal is to provide high-quality, timely evidence on the comparative effectiveness of two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of gout. We will pursue this objective by utilizing the linked Partners’ EHR-Medicare database (2007-2016); this linked database includes all patients aged ≥65 years enrolled in Medicare Parts A/B/D who had ≥1 encounter at one of the Partners Healthcare hospitals. We will have longitudinal, clinically important data on patients’ demographics, body mass index, visit notes, laboratory results including SUA and serum creatinine, as well as all Medicare claims for inpatient and outpatient visits, procedures, and prescription drugs. The two specific aims of this 3-year proposal are: 1) to examine the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of gout flares versus usual care and 2) to assess the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of kidney disease and CVD versus usual care.  Given the substantial prevalence of gout, the suboptimal management of gout and lack of comparative trial of different treatment strategies, this proposed study will make an immediate, important contribution to the management of gout in clinical practice. This work will not only investigate the effects of different treatment strategies on gout flares but also on common comorbidities in patients with gout such as kidney and CVD. Furthermore, this proposed study will advance understanding of how to improve ascertainment of dynamic outcomes and control for time-varying confounding by utilizing sophisticated and innovative epidemiologic as well as bioinformatics methods in a large EHR database linked with Medicare claims. Narrative Gout is a common, painful inflammatory arthritis caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout. While rheumatology societies recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, there is currently no clinical data whether TTT approach is better than urate- lowering therapy but no regular monitoring of uric acid levels (i.e., usual care); therefore, this 3-year research proposal examines the comparative effectiveness of the two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of chronic gout in a real-world setting.",Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout,10176417,R01AR073314,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allopurinol', 'American', 'American College of Physicians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Flare', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Impairment', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Research Proposals', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urate', 'Uric Acid', 'Visit', 'Work', 'active comparator', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative trial', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'febuxostat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'population based', 'rheumatologist', 'routine care', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'water solubility', 'xanthine oxidase inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,407634
"Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage large-scale clinical data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify existing pharmaceutical agents commonly prescribed for a multitude of indications that are incidentally associated with improvements in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,10150094,R01MH121397,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Paroxetine', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Scanning', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'military veteran', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label drug', 'prospective', 'psychopharmacologic', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy development', 'treatment guidelines', 'venlafaxine', 'working group']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,554790
"(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI Abstract Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in the US has increased by 38% over the last eight years, with drugs as a major contributor to AKI in hospitalized patients. Drug-associated AKI (D-AKI) results in severe consequences with approximately 40% of patients experiencing in-hospital death or dialysis dependence and 70% having evidence of residual kidney damage following the initial D-AKI event. We have determined that many patients at high risk for AKI are identified late and often continue to receive nephrotoxic drugs until AKI becomes severe. Thus, we designed a proposal to address the need for early, appropriate management of nephrotoxins in high-risk patients by studying the effect of an advanced clinical decision support system (CDSS) for primary physicians and hospitalists aimed at reducing D-AKI in hospitalized adults. Specifically, we aim to 1) optimize the clinical performance of D-AKI risk-alerts generated by a clinical decision support system; 2) test whether an advanced clinical decision support system coupled with a pharmacist-led intervention improves short and long- term outcomes for patients with D-AKI; and 3) determine physician perception of the pharmacists’ performance, physician acceptance and cost-effectiveness of our intervention. In 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published the first comprehensive AKI clinical practice guideline. Recommendations include the use of standard criteria for defining and staging AKI and a series of stage-based management steps to be considered for all patients with AKI or at risk for developing it. However, clinicians have been slow to adopt these recommendations and some groups (most notably the US KDOQI expert panel), while endorsing the guideline overall, have called for more research testing the recommendations. Our proposal directly addresses this concern by testing whether a unique clinical decision support system identifying high risk patients coupled with an advanced pharmacist service directed to the primary physician can address D-AKI and drug dosing for other forms of AKI to improve patient care. Thus, our central goal is to examine the effect of a pharmacist-led intervention on the early detection and management of AKI, progression of and short-term recovery from AKI, and on various AKI-related outcomes. Project Narrative Patients at high risk for acute kidney injury are often identified late and often do not receive recommended diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, with drugs being the most common cause; yet are potentially preventable. Clinical decision support to physicians in the form of automated alerts and pharmacist guidance for high-risk patients with drug-associated acute kidney injury (D-AKI) could dramatically improve risk assessment, medication use, and drug dosing in even non-drug-associated acute kidney injury. In this randomized control trial application, we will test whether adult hospitalized patients with D-AKI, cared for by physicians randomized to receive clinical decision support with an advanced pharmacist-led intervention, will have a lower risk for dialysis and premature death.",(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI,10209005,R01DK121730,"['Accounting', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Drug Modelings', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Hospitalists', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'aging population', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detection platform', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'equipment training', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'high risk', 'imaging agent', 'implementation cost', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'nephrotoxicity', 'non-drug', 'post intervention', 'premature', 'renal damage', 'risk prediction model', 'standard of care']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,562198
"Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Chronic wounds affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States. Current standard protocols for wound management do not guarantee healing and focus on maintaining a wound environment that is conducive to passive self-healing. Hence, there is a need to develop alternative treatments that promote active healing and shorten healing time leading to reduced costs. We have previously reported that treatment with low-frequency (20-100 kHz), low-intensity (50-150 mW/cm2) ultrasound (LFLI US) significantly (p<0.03) reduces venous ulcer size in vivo as compared to wounds treated with a sham device. This proposal aims at determining the biological mechanisms by which LFLI US promotes chronic wound healing in vitro. There is evidence that the cause of impaired healing is the dysregulation of macrophage phenotype, especially the defective transition from pro- inflammatory (M1) to pro-healing (M2) macrophages. Our characterization of tissue debrided from chronic wounds has shown that healing chronic wounds contain higher proportions of M1-like than M2- like macrophages. Additionally, the signaling protein Rac2, downstream of integrin and focal adhesion kinase activation, is a key regulator of mechanotransduction in macrophages and facilitates the transition of macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype. The proposed study will systematically examine the effects of LFLI ultrasound on macrophage phenotype, using macrophages cultured in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. We hypothesize that LFLI US directly and indirectly stimulates the transition of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to pro-healing M2 macrophages via Rac2. This project will enhance our understanding of chronic wound healing and the potential of therapeutic ultrasound to accelerate healing. Aim 1 will elucidate the direct effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype by treating inflammatory macrophages directly with LFLI US and characterizing functional changes (proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis), protein/cytokine secretion, and gene expression. Concurrently, we will validate Rac2 as the potential mechanotransduction pathway which promotes M1 to M2 macrophages transition by analyzing integrins, focal adhesion kinases, and Rac2 via confocal microscopy and RNA characterization. [Aim 2 will validate the in vitro findings from Aim 1 using our previously developed diagnostic M1/M2 score on debrided tissue from chronic wound patients treated with LFLI US.] Aim 3 will elucidate the indirect effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype via a 3D macrophage fibroblast co-culture. The results of this study will inform the optimal design of LFLI ultrasound therapy protocols, lead to a personalized, active treatment for chronic wounds, accelerate chronic wound healing, and contribute to reduced annual wound care costs. Project Narrative Chronic wounds currently affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States and an excess of 25 billion dollars is spent annually on treatment. Current standards of care for chronic wounds, including months of weekly re-dressings and debridement, fails to guarantee active wound healing or closure. To address this issue, we propose to determine the biological mechanism responsible for therapeutic ultrasound mediated healing, low-intensity (<100mW/cm2), low-frequency (20kHz) ultrasound that has been shown to accelerate chronic wound closure in pilot clinical studies.","Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound",10137782,F31AR074847,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Care', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Debridement', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired healing', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Integrins', 'Lead', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Prunella vulgaris', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Signaling Protein', 'Source', 'Sterile coverings', 'Stimulus', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonic Therapy', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Varicose Ulcer', 'active method', 'alternative treatment', 'angiogenesis', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'care costs', 'cell type', 'chronic wound', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'diabetic ulcer', 'healing', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mechanotransduction', 'migration', 'rac2 GTP-binding protein', 'scaffold', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound closure', 'wound environment', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",NIAMS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning Abstract: Our main clinical objective for this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities by significantly improving the surgical planning method. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffer from CMF deformities. The basic principles of CMF surgery involve the restoration of deformed CMF structures back to normal anatomy and functions with osteotomy, autologous, bone grafts, or vascularized free flaps. The success of CMF surgery depends on not only the technical aspects of the operation, but also, to a large extent, the precise formulation of a surgical plan. However, CMF surgical planning is extremely challenging due to the complex nature of CMF anatomy and deformity. During a routine CMF surgical planning, a surgeon first acquires a three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient's skull. He then performs 3D cephalometric analysis to quantify the deformity. Finally, the surgery is simulated by virtually cutting the 3D model into multiple bony segments. The surgeon then tries his best to move and rotate each segment individually to a desired position within the normal range of cephalometric values (the current standard of care). This is problematic as “normal” cephalometric values are the averageness of normal population, in which each value has a mean and a standard deviation. Due to the variation within the normal values, the surgeon must often guess what the exact value the patient's cephalometric measurement should be corrected to. In addition, cephalometry is a group of only linear and angular measurements, which certainly cannot represent the complex nature of human CMF structures. Therefore, surgical outcomes are often subjective and heavily dependent on the surgeons' experience and artistic talent. Because each human face is different, the average “normal values” cannot represent the complex morphology of each individual face. To this end, we hypothesize that if a surgeon can foresee what the normal CMF shape of the patient should be, the surgical plan will be objective and personalized. Therefore, in this project, we propose developing and validating a new surgical planning method of using patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models. The feasibility of our approach has already been proven by our preliminary studies. The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively. The results will be especially beneficial to patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic craniofacial deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer. In the future, our approach can also be used to design and print 3D patient-specific resorbable bone implants with tissue engineering capability for bone regeneration. Project Narrative:  The current standard of care of making treatment plan for patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF)  deformities is cephalometric analysis, including a group of linear and angular measurements, which  cannot represent the complex morphology of human CMF facial structures.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative shape-based surgical planning method of using  patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models, for replacing the current subjective  cephalometric method.  The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing  personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively, which is especially beneficial  to the patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer.",Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning,10197880,R01DE027251,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Autologous', 'Back', 'Bilateral', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Head', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Model', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'operation', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'psychologic', 'restoration', 'skull base', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'two-dimensional', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality simulator', 'virtual surgery']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,574725
"Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating cancer treatment, which has immense health and economic burdens worldwide. However, practical considerations that allow an RCT to be conducted typically require a relatively small sample size and restricted eligibility criteria such that the study has inadequate power to generalize treatment effects to elderly patients or other under-represented patient pop- ulations. On the other hand, massive real-world data (RWD) are increasingly captured by population-based databases and registries, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), SEER-Medicare, and National Cancer Database (NCDB), that have much broader demographic and clinical diversity compared to RCT cohorts. Treatment evaluation using causal inference methods and RWD that were not collected purely for re- search purposes is now frequently performed but fraught with limitations such as confounding due to lack of randomization. In fact, the agreement between RCT and RWD ﬁndings is often low in the analysis of matched RCT and RWD studies with the same treatment comparisons. Although several national organizations and reg- ulatory agencies have advocated using RWD to complement RCTs, methods that integrate these two potentially complementary data sources and achieve better treatment evaluation over the use of a single data source alone have yet to be developed.  This proposal is motivated by the PIs' collaborative work to study the safety and efﬁcacy of treatment strategies for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal cancer patients by integrating data from multiple sources: RCTs from NCI cooperative groups and the real-world databases (e.g. SEER, SEER-Medicare, and NCDB). The objective of this project is to develop new statistical methods for integrative analyses of RCTs and RWD that can improve the generalizability and increase estimation efﬁciency of RCT ﬁndings to more diverse ""real-world"" patients as well as under-studied populations while avoiding confounding bias inherent in RWD. In Aim 1, we develop methods for statistical analysis of RCT data to compare chemoradiotherapy patterns for the real-world and elderly NSCLC patients by leveraging the baseline covariates of comparable patients from SEER, for whom the temporal information of chemotherapy and radiation and the outcome are both missing. Aims 2 and 3 focus on the settings when both RCT and RWD provide comparable covariates, treatment, and outcome information. In Aim 2, we develop improved analysis of RCT data to evaluate trimodality therapy versus surgery alone for the real-world and elderly esophageal cancer patients by exploiting the large sample size and predictive power offered by the NCDB/SEER-Medicare. In Aim 3, we develop new efﬁcient and data-adaptive methods to estimate individualized treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation, possibly modiﬁed by age and tumor size, for stage IB resected NSCLC patients by integrating RCT and NCDB data. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is closely in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, which placed additional focus on the use of big real-world data to support decision making and precision medicine. The availability of multiple data sources, namely randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world databases, presents unique and novel opportunities for medical research, because the knowledge that can be acquired from integrative analyses would not be possible from any single-source analysis alone. Our effort is important to bridge RCTs and vast real-world databases and registries arising from clinical practices in order to better understand how treatment works for the real-world and under-studied patient populations outside relatively narrow RCT eligibility criteria and provide accurate and reliable evidence for patient-centered care.",Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data,10149900,R01AG066883,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Medical Research', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'SEER Program', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Target Populations', 'Therapy trial', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'disease registry', 'esophageal cancer patient', 'health economics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'safety study', 'study population', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2021,391243
"Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Project Summary     Coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves the lives of patients with coronary disease (CAD) as a group,  but 20% of patients remain symptomatic one year after surgery. In clinical practice CABG decisions are largely  driven by stenosis severity determined from invasive angiography despite the known relevance of functional  CAD  parameters.  This  practical  impasse  will  continue  to  exist  without  clinically  available,  high-­resolution,  quantitative functional imaging, and a better understanding of the clinical outcomes in relation to anatomical  (angiography)  and  functional  (ischemia,  scar  tissue)  factors.  The  long-­term  goal  is  to  improve  outcome  of  CABG  through  personalized  imaging-­guided  care.  The  overall  objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  identify  determinants  of  myocardial  flow  restoration  (ischemia  reduction),  and  develop  integrated  imaging  tools  for  individualized,  lesion-­specific  CABG  decision-­making,  and  computational  flow  simulations  based  on  the  patient’s  anatomy  and  function  to  predict  the  hemodynamic  outcome.  Supported  by  studies  using  invasive  FFR-­guided  CABG,  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  research  is  that  integration  of  anatomical  (angiography)  and functional information (ischemia, scar tissue) will identify individual coronary vessels that will benefit from  revascularization, and individual optimization of surgical procedures by flow simulations will maximize clinical  benefit  of  CABG  for  patients  with  CAD.  Supported  by  promising  preliminary  data,  three  specific  aims  are  proposed:  1)  Prospectively  identify  angiographic,  functional  and  clinical  baseline  determinants  of  outcome  after CABG, defined as improvement of myocardial perfusion (ischemia reduction) and angina symptoms;; 2)  Develop  and  validate  a  comprehensive  imaging  strategy  and  clinically  applicable  tool  that  integrate  high-­ resolution  angiographic  and  quantitative  functional  information  (ischemia,  viability)  for  per-­vessel/lesion  revascularization  decisions;;  3)  Develop  and  validate  new  multi-­parametric  computational  flow  simulations,  with incorporation of functional imaging data, which allows for prediction of individual hemodynamic outcome  and  ultimately  surgical  optimization  based  on  virtual  hemodynamic  results.  This  approach  is  innovative  because  new  imaging  techniques  will  advance  the  field’s  understanding  of  CABG  physiology,  and  new  clinically applicable tools will be developed for comprehensive clinical decision-­making and optimized surgical  planning. The acquired knowledge and developed tools are applicable to other vascular contexts, and may  also  be  instrumental  for  new  therapeutic  innovations.  The  proposed  research  is  significant  because  identification  of  CABG  outcome  determinants,  and  new  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance,  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  effectiveness  (by  complete  functional  revascularization)  and  efficiency  of  CABG  (by  avoiding  futile  grafts).  For  a  large  group  of  patients,  these  innovations  will improve  the patient-­valued  benefit  of  CABG (complications, symptoms),  and also decrease  cost by improved efficiency of care.     Project Narrative    The proposed research is relevant to the public health because identification of CABG outcome determinants,  and  development  of  diagnostic  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance  of  CABG  surgery,  can  help  achieve  complete  functional  revascularization  and  restoration  of  myocardial  blood  flow  in  more  patients.  Thus,  the  proposed  research  is  relevant  to  the  NIH’s  mission  that  pertains  to  the  discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of  that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. ",Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery,10093121,R01HL141712,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intuition', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity -

"Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC) SUMMARY: In 2018, nearly 34,000 adults in the US and over 275,000 worldwide were diagnosed with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC). In the US alone >6,600 died from the disease in 2018. In addition to stage, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, depth of invasion, and close or frankly positive resection margins are used to help stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, or high risk categories. Currently, all OC-SCC patients are treated primarily by surgical resection. Post-operative treatment depends on patient risk category. Low-risk patients receive surgery alone and studies have shown the benefit of PORT (Post-operative radiation therapy) in selected patients. A retrospective analysis of 1467 patients with low-risk OC-SCC where 740 (50.4%) received PORT had improved overall survival compared to 727 patients treated with surgery alone. Identifying these patients and better stratifying their risk of progression is critical. Meanwhile, patients with loco-regionally advanced (i.e. intermediate and high risk) disease are treated with PORT as standard. Select high risk patients may be treated with concomitant chemoradiation or subsequent chemotherapy. There is thus an urgent need to develop companion diagnostic tools to better define which patients will benefit from PORT, or, if intermediate or high risk, who will benefit from systemic therapy intensification.  Recently, our group has developed a OC-SCC histomorphometric based image risk classifier (OHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to identify patients who are likely to recur versus those who are not. OHbIC was trained and validated on N=115 OC-SCC patients, and it had a 2 and 7-fold higher-correlation with disease specific survival compared to the 7th edition AJCC N- and T-stage (clinical variables used in patient prognosis). In this NIH R01, we seek to further improve the prognostic and predictive accuracy of OHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, pattern of invasion at the tumor leading edge, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as potential histopathological markers of prognostic relevance in OC-SCC. Additionally, we seek to 1) validate OHbIC as prognostic of survival in clinically defined low-risk patients and identify those low-risk patients who would benefit from PORT and 2) validate OHbIC as not only prognostic of survival but also predictive of benefit from chemotherapeutic intensification for patients with loco-regionally advanced disease.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) digital pathomics from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in oral cancer from Vanderbilt University, Cleveland Clinic, San Francisco VA, and Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai to establish OHbIC as a tissue non-destructive and Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for OC-SCC patients. Project Relevance: In this project, we seek to improve the predictive accuracy of a computerized histomorphometric predictor (OHbIC) for risk stratification, outcome prediction and added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC) from routine H&E tissue slide images. The success of this project will pave the way for its adoption as a tissue non-destructive Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of OC-SCC patients for whom therapies could be either left as standard, or require “escalation”, depending on the OHbIC risk score.",Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC),10075748,R01CA249992,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Head and neck structure', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'India', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Platinum', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'collaborative trial', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lymphatic Invasion', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'men', 'mouth squamous cell carcinoma', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'perineural', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive test', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prognostic of survival', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,697902
"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,10153763,K08DK115891,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Membranous Glomerulonephritis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Publications', 'Renal glomerular disease', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biological systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'kidney biopsy', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2021,169560
"Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited. Therapeutic clinical trials in TBI have yielded disappointing results owing in part to the difficulty in accounting for clinically important heterogeneity within TBI. Early delivery of therapy is essential after TBI to reduce secondary brain injury, but unrestricted treatment of all brain injuries could be harmful. TBI stimulates a complex cascade of immunologic responses, both centrally and peripherally. These peripheral immune responses to TBI could serve as an early sensor of risk phenotype given the rapid, readily measurable response in the blood. An improved ability to risk-stratify patients on admission will streamline patient selection for aggressive interventions—such as invasive neuromonitoring—versus selection of those patients who can safely be observed reducing potential harms. Holly E Hinson, MD MCR is a Neurologist and Neurointensivist at Oregon Health and Science University where she cares for patients with severe acute brain injury. The objective of this application is to develop supervised learning models of actionable short- and long-term outcomes post-TBI and to interrogate if pre-specified immunoregulatory proteins add predictive power to the models over clinical features alone. Her central hypothesis is that immunoregulatory proteomic signatures improve our ability to classify a low-risk clinical phenotype after TBI. Dr. Hinson’s preliminary data suggest peripheral cytokine levels are associated with actionable clinical events acutely after TBI. The project employs a highly-sensitive, single molecule immunoarray (SIMOA) to detect immunoregulatory proteins complemented with an unbiased proteomic approach utilizing global discovery mass spectrometry. She will develop and assess a series of models incorporating proteomic signatures to classify: acute progressive intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 1A), acute neurologic deterioration (Aim 1B), and long-term outcomes measured by the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (Aim 2). She will develop these models in a well-defined, clinical trial population (development set), and test their ability to correctly classify outcome in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort at OHSU (test set). Under a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, the project will generate new insights into low-risk phenotype recognition and outcome classification after acute TBI. The proposed patient-oriented research project will be enhanced by a structured didactic program in the principles of predictive modeling and patient phenotyping (including proteomics), which will provide Dr. Hinson with the critical skills she will need to conduct independent, innovative translational clinical research in the field of neurotrauma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited—we lack methods to assess a patient’s risk of deterioration at admission. An improved ability to classify patients early after injury will allow us to identify those who may benefit from aggressive interventions versus those who can safely be observed. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and assess a series of predictive models incorporating immune proteins from peripheral blood to aid in the prediction of which patients are at low-risk for complications and poor outcome after TBI.",Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures,10155597,K23NS110828,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Admission activity', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Holly', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Ion Transport', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Signaling Protein', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'TBI treatment', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'placebo group', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'sensor', 'single molecule', 'skills', 'supervised learning']",NINDS,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,188709

"Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer Project Summary. The goal of this project is to develop, optimize, and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven, medical imaging platform that utilizes computed tomography (CT) imaging to identify the presence of extranodal extension (ENE) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC is a debilitating disease with significant patient-related morbidity related to the disease itself and its management, which is complex and consists of a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. A key factor in determining proper HNSCC management is the presence of ENE, which occurs when tumor infiltrates through the capsule of an involved lymph node into the surrounding tissue. ENE is both an important prognostic factor and an indication for adjuvant treatment escalation with the addition of chemotherapy to radiation following surgery. This “trimodality therapy” is problematic, as it is associated with increased treatment-related morbidity and healthcare costs, but no improvement in disease control compared to upfront chemoradiation alone. The challenge is that ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE identification has proven unreliable for even expert diagnosticians, leading to high rates of trimodality therapy and suboptimal treatment outcomes. In HNSCC management there is a critical need for improved pretreatment ENE identification to 1) select appropriate patients for surgery to avoid the excess morbidity and costs of trimodality therapy, 2) risk-stratify patients optimally, and 3) select appropriate patients for treatment de-escalation or intensification clinical trials. In recent years, Deep learning, a subtype of machine learning, under the umbrella of AI, has generated breakthroughs in computerized medical image analysis, at times outperforming human experts and discovering patterns hidden to the naked eye. While AI is poised to transform the fields of cancer imaging and personalized cancer care, there remain significant barriers to clinical implementation. The hypothesis of this project is that AI can be used to successfully identify HNSCC ENE on pretreatment imaging in retrospective and prospective patient cohorts and to develop a platform for lymph node auto-segmentation that will promote clinical utility of the platform. This hypothesis will be tested by rigorous optimization and evaluation of a deep learning ENE identification platform. Specifically, the platform will be validated for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and discriminatory performance on two heterogeneous retrospective datasets and two prospective cohorts derived from institutional and national Phase II clinical trials for HNSCC patients. The platform will then be directly compared with head and neck radiologists to determine if radiologist performance can be augmented with AI. In parallel, AI will be utilized to develop an auto-segmentation platform for tumor and lymph nodes, which will 1) improve the platform's clinical impact and 2) provide a valuable tool for treatment planning and future imaging-based research for HNSCC patients. 1 Project Narrative Identification of extranodal extension (ENE) for head and neck cancer in the pretreatment setting would be extremely useful in selecting the optimal treatment strategy for patients. Currently, ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE prediction has proven unreliable for expert diagnosticians. This project uses artificial intelligence to identify ENE pretreatment on Computed Tomography, with the goal of developing a clinically usable tool to help patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancers and their physicians choose the most effective treatment strategy that minimizes the risk of side effects.","Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer",10105483,K08DE030216,"['Adjuvant', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Extranodal', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck Dissection', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Prospective cohort', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'capsule', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'heuristics', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'lymph nodes', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient stratification', 'personalized cancer care', 'phase II trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'risk minimization', 'risk stratification', 'side effect', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIDCR,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2021,168240
"Intelligent Intensive Care Unit (I2CU): Pervasive Sensing and Artificial Intelligence for Augmented Clinical Decision-making Project Summary Although close monitoring and dynamic assessment of patient acuity are key aspects of ICU care, both are limited by the time constraints imposed on healthcare providers. Currently, dynamic and precise assessment of patient’s acuity in ICU rely almost exclusively on physicians’ clinical judgment and vigilance. Furthermore, important visual assessment details, such as facial expressions, posture, and mobility, are captured sporadically by overburdened nurses or are not captured at all. However, these visual assessment details are associated with critical indices such as physical function, pain and subsequent clinical deterioration. The PIs’ long-term goal is to sense, quantify, and communicate patient’s clinical condition in an autonomous and precise manner. The overall objective of this application is to develop the novel tools for sensing, quantifying, and communicating any patient’s condition in an autonomous, precise, and interpretable manner. The central hypothesis is that deep learning models will be superior to existing acuity clinical scores by predicting acuity in a dynamic, precise, and interpretable manner, using autonomous assessment of pain, emotional distress and physical function, together with clinical and physiologic data. The hypothesis has been formulated based on preliminary data and is well-grounded in clinical care literature. The rationale is that autonomous and precise patient quantification can result in enhanced clinical workflow and early intervention. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. (1) Developing and validating an interpretable deep learning algorithm for precise and dynamic prediction of the patient’s clinical status to determine if it is more accurate in predicting daily care transition outcomes, while providing interpretable information to the physician. (2) Developing a pervasive sensing system for autonomous visual assessment of critically ill patients to determine if it can provide accurate visual assessment of a patient compared to human expert, and if it can enrich acuity prediction when combined with clinical data. (3) Implementing and evaluating an intelligent platform for real- time integration of autonomous visual assessment and acuity prediction in clinical workflow to determine accuracy in real-time prospective evaluation and to determine physicians’ risk perception and satisfaction. The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) dynamically predict precise patient trajectory, (2) autonomously perform visual assessment in the ICU, and (3) implement artificial intelligence platform in real time in clinical workflow. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and critical barriers in critical care, including (1) lack of precise and real-time prediction of clinical trajectory, (2) manual repetitive ICU assessments, and (3) uncaptured patient aspects. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow and early critical care intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to advancing disease diagnosis through medical applications of new tools and technologies, as the proposed research applies advanced computational methods and sensing technologies to automatically quantify and convey patient status in real-time.",Intelligent Intensive Care Unit (I2CU): Pervasive Sensing and Artificial Intelligence for Augmented Clinical Decision-making,10154047,R01EB029699,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deterioration', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Facial Expression', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospital Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical Function', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'advanced disease', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disease diagnosis', 'emotional distress', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'risk perception', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'vigilance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,632088
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early and assist care providers in selecting the best treatment to minimize complications and death from hemorrhage.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation,10063555,R01HL149670,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Technology', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Provider', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'preventable death', 'profiles in patients', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,695258
"Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system Project Summary/Abstract This SBIR Phase I project will develop a deep learning-based algorithm to analyze the sound of blood flow in mature arterio-venous (AV) fistulas used for hemodialysis access. This monitoring tool can help to identify fistulas with impending failure in patients who are in need of surgical intervention to ensure patency of the patient’s hemodialysis access. The specific aims of the study are (1) to create the world’s first deep learning-scale database of mature AV fistula sounds paired with ultrasound imaging from hemodialysis patients, and (2) develop and evaluate the performance of a deep learning classification model trained via semi-supervised learning to discriminate between patients with patent fistulas and patients with failing fistulas. By integrating this deep learning algorithm into Eko’s mobile and cloud software platform, we anticipate this algorithm will enable better monitoring for failing fistulas. During Phase I of the project we will recruit study subjects in vascular surgery and interventional radiology clinics at Columbia University Medical Center. The follow-up SBIR Phase II project will extend our algorithm to account for (1) broader forms of hemodialysis access including AV grafts, which often fail more frequently than fistulas, and premature fistulas, which are often abandoned, and (2) longitudinal collection and analysis of hemodialysis access sounds at commercial dialysis centers and in patients’ homes. SBIR Project Narrative In creating the world’s largest annotated dataset of mature AV fistula sounds and corresponding ultrasounds, Eko will gain unprecedented insights into fistula blood flow. We expect this to advance our scientific understanding of the fluid dynamics of fistulas, and help explain how and why hemodialysis access fails at such a high rate over time. A clinical decision support algorithm trained from this dataset can help healthcare systems detect fistula failures earlier, leading to more timely interventions that can avert costly complications, prolong life expectancy, and improve quality of life for hemodialysis patients as their care transitions from clinic to home care.",Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system,10255460,R43DK129107,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auscultation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Bluetooth', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Eko', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Fistula', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Sounds', 'Hemodialysis', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life Expectancy', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicare', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Research Design', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stethoscopes', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'algorithm training', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cloud software', 'commercialization', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data streams', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'patient home care', 'premature', 'recruit', 'skills', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NIDDK,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R43,2021,299358
"Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Project Summary/Abstract By 2060, approximately 14 million adults are expected to live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Although ADRD patients represent 10% of the general geriatric population, they account for 37% of the direct healthcare expenditures. Compared to other older adults, ADRD patients are at a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and unplanned 30-day hospital readmission (hereafter “readmission”). Readmissions are costly and expose ADRD patients to expedited cognitive decline, premature institutionalization, and death. Availability of a caregiver after hospital discharge is critical for ADRD patients to ensure adherence to diet, medications, and follow-up appointments. There is a paucity of evidence examining readmission among the ADRD population. Most risk-assessment tools (e.g. LACE Index) have poor discrimination power and lack inclusion of influential medical and social features, and caregiver availability particular to ADRD patients. A potential solution is to develop a risk tool using hospitals’ electronic health records (EHRs) because they contain salient clinical and sociodemographic features as well as a wealth of information from physicians’, nurses’ and social workers’ notes (unstructured EHRs data). The specific research aims for this proposal are to (1) develop and validate a risk-assessment tool for predicting readmission among ADRD patients; (2) examine the feasibility/acceptability and clinical/economic utility of the readmission risk- assessment tool; and (3) develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract information on caregiver availability from unstructured EHRs (exploratory). We hypothesize that the predictive power of our risk tool will be at least 20% higher than that of LACE Index (the current risk tool used in the Michigan Medicine hospitals). To accomplish this project, my mentors and I have defined a set of targeted career goals and educational training. My training aims include (1) gain familiarity with the clinical aspects of ADRD (linked with Research Aim 1); (2) acquire methodological skills in machine learning and predictive modeling (linked with Research Aim 1); (3) develop an understanding of the logistics of the ADRD patient discharge and care transition processes (linked with Research Aim 2); and (4) gain proficiency in NLP and algorithm validation (linked with Research Aim 3). By completion of this award, I will have used EHRs and data science to develop a validated risk-assessment tool for readmission for hospitalized ADRD patients. The results will enable efficient and targeted discharge planning to reduce readmission and wasteful spending. It will also provide pilot data needed to apply for an R01 examining the optimization of discharge process/location for hospitalized ADRD patients. This career development award will lay the foundation for me to become a unique health economist specialized in efficient care transitions for ADRD patients. Narrative Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) are at higher risk of hospitalization and 30-day readmission (readmission) compared to other older adults. Readmission is expensive and increases the risk of institutionalization and premature death among ADRD patients. The main goal of this proposal is to use Michigan Medicine’s electronic health records to develop a tool to identify high-risk ADRD patients.",Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia,10263307,K01AG068361,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Diet', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Discrimination', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Institutionalization', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Social Workers', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'electronic structure', 'follow-up', 'frailty', 'health data', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'premature', 'readmission risk', 'skills', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,130140
"Identifying treatment responders in medication trials for AUD using machine learning approaches ABSTRACT Alcohol use disorder (AUD), as defined in DSM-5, represents a highly prevalent, costly, and often untreated condition in the United States. Pharmacotherapy offers a promising avenue for treating AUD and for improving clinical outcomes for this debilitating disorder. While developing novel medications to treat AUD remains a high priority research area, there remain major opportunities to further elucidate clinical response in completed medication trials. To that end, a key question in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is which patients respond to a given pharmacotherapy. Identifying treatment responders provides major opportunities to advance clinical care for AUD by personalizing medication practices on the bases of variables/predictors of good clinical response. For example, while the effect size for medications such as naltrexone is deemed small-to-moderate, a host of studies over the past decade have shown that its effect size may be considerably larger for certain subgroups of patients. Towards advancing precision medicine for AUD and leveraging data from a host of carefully conducted RCTs for AUD, this R03 application seeks to conduct secondary data analysis. Specifically, we propose to analyze data from four RCTs conducted by the NIAAA Clinical Investigations Group (NCIG). These state-of-the-art RCTs for AUD have tested the following pharmacotherapies: (a) quetiapine, (b) Levetiracetam XR (Keppra XR®), (c) Varenicline (Chantix®), and (d) HORIZANT® (Gabapentin Enacarbil) Extended-Release. In this R03 application, we propose to use a machine learning approach to identify treatment responders in the NCIG RCTs. Machine learning represents a highly promising and underutilized data analytic strategy in the field of AUD treatment response. Machine learning models prioritize the ability to predict future outcomes over creating perfectly fitting models for the data at hand. This results in models which are more generalizable to future observations, which fits well with our goal of identifying responders in RCTs. Leveraging data from these pivotal RCTs through secondary data analysis and using novel analytic methods, namely machine learning, provides a cost-effective approach to identifying AUD pharmacotherapy responders. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this R03 application, we propose to use a machine learning approach to identify treatment responders in pivotal clinical trials for AUD.

"Sepsis online: learning while doing to understand biology and treatment PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT More than 1 million Americans are hospitalized with sepsis each year, and nearly one in five don’t survive. Most efforts to reduce sepsis deaths begin with the premise that patients are largely similar, and that ether moving treatment earlier or targeting therapeutics to a single mechanism will improve outcomes. In prior work funded by a NIGMS R35 award, we derived sepsis endotypes using a suite of machine learning methods inside the electronic health records (EHR) in a large integrated health system. These endotypes differed in biology, outcomes, and treatment response, and were reproduced in thousands of patients. But how will they lead to precision care? In this Renewal, we will leverage our clinical translational laboratory and remnant blood collection to better understand the biology of sepsis endotypes and explore new domains related to pathogen, microbiome, and molecular mechanisms. We will use Bayesian causal networks and reinforcement learning to optimize treatment policies over endotypes in more than 10 million EHR encounters. Finally, we will move learning online and embed endotypes inside the EHR at the point-of-care. These steps will take the science of sepsis endotypes and inform clinical decisions made under time pressure and uncertainty. By testing endotype treatment policies at the “live-edge”, we will strengthen causal inference, mechanistic insight, and learn while doing. My program will be supervised by external advisory boards with expertise in machine learning, inflammation, immunology, computational and systems biology, causal methods, artificial intelligence, and health information technology. This work will further develop my clinical-translational laboratory and cross-cutting mentorship of junior scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis endotypes are biological subtypes defined by distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms and identified by corresponding biomarkers. Endotypes may respond differently to sepsis treatment. Moving the science of sepsis endotypes from offline to online learning in the electronic health record has the potential to broaden our understanding of sepsis biology, improve causal inference, and advance precision care.",Sepsis online: learning while doing to understand biology and treatment,10169130,R35GM119519,"['American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational Biology', 'E-learning', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethers', 'Funding', 'Immunology', 'Inflammation', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Supervision', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'microbiome', 'pathogen', 'personalized care', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'programs', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R35,2021,483099
"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice.

"A framework to stratify patient cohorts for clinical management PROJECT SUMMARY  Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have limited functionality to find patients that can benefit by particular interventions. Hence, clinicians are unable to proactively reach-out to these patients, leading to an ever-widening evidence-care gap. The goal of this proposal is to improve healthcare delivery. The objective is to develop a data-framework for accurately finding patients that can benefits from large/population scale interventions. We will investigate two dimensions for improving the patient search—increasing the resolution of the search (aim 1) and increasing the quality of the data that the search is performed on (aim 2). In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that a rule-based model of the relevant clinical guideline, will find patients with higher accuracy than the conventional queries. The rational is that the rule-based approach will allow complex groupings of the eligibility criteria and will thereby provide a higher resolution of search than conventional query. In aim 2 we will investigate whether machine learning (ML) can improve the accuracy of patient data and contribute to the accuracy of search results obtained through the conventional query and the guideline rule-base. In addition to the above aims, in aim 3 we will automate deployment of the rule-base and ML models and minimize the manual effort for developing ML models. This proposal builds on the lipid management program at Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH). Our work will be focused on finding patients for lipid- management; however, our methodology and tooling will be generalizable to other medical areas and institutions. The study team includes national experts in cardiology, machine learning, health information technology (HIT) and open-source software development. We will create an open-source software platform (i2b2-ML) by extending the popular `Informatics for Integration Biology and the Bedside' (i2b2) platform that we have developed and supported over the past 10 years and that is used by over 200 medical centers. I2b2-ML will extend i2b2's proven ability to characterize patient cohorts for research into the clinical realm. Our study will yield methodology for accurately finding patients that can benefit by clinical intervention and will thereby enable cost-effectiveness of population programs. It will directly help scale the lipid management program at BWH to benefit a wider patient population. Our detailed characterization of the gaps in lipid management at a large healthcare system will potentially inform improvements in the lipid management guideline. The methodology and tooling developed in this project will be disseminated in open-source for potential incorporation in the clinical data infrastructure at other institutions, which will facilitate implementation of population-scale clinical programs across the nation. In addition, the resultant infrastructure will serve as a platform for development of artificial intelligence-based applications to improve clinical care. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact on health care delivery so that more patients will get the optimal care. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose developing Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), a well-established, open source, platform that is currently used at over 200 hospitals and medical centers to use machine learning for identifying patient groups receiving suboptimal care. The proposed work will enable healthcare institutions across the United States to proactively reach-out to these patients, for delivering the appropriate clinical intervention.

"Leveraging Big Data and Deep Learning to Develop Next Generation Decision Support Tools to Improve Glycemic Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary The hallmark of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is insufficient insulin production caused by pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Most people treat their T1D through multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin or use of a transcutaneous insulin pump. Several decision support smartphone apps exist to help people estimate insulin doses based on continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data and food intake. More sophisticated decision support tools employ mathematical models of human physiology to predict future glucose levels and provide generalized insulin therapy recommendations. Exercise is a crucial component of the long-term management of T1D, however many people avoid physical activity for fear of hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL). While consensus guidelines exist to help people manage glucose during physical activity, people still experience acute complications. Mathematical models of aerobic exercise yield promise in predicting hypoglycemia during controlled in- clinic experiments but do not perform well in the real-world or during other types of exercise. There is a critical need for a decision support system that helps people with T1D maintain safe glucose levels around exercise of varying types. The goal of this proposal is to develop a decision support tool to help people with T1D who utilize CGM better manage their glucose surrounding exercise. This tool will be called AIDES, the Artificially Intelligent Diabetic Exercise Support system. We hypothesize that use of a novel exercise- specific decision support tool, powered by predictive physiological modelling, artificial intelligence (AI), and deep learning, can provide treatment recommendations to reduce the number of hypoglycemic events experienced by people with T1D around regular physical exercise. In our first aim, we will develop a new model of resistance exercise that describes both insulin- and non-insulin mediated effects on glucose dynamics. We will then create a novel hybrid computational framework that harnesses AI to augment physiology models of aerobic and resistance exercise. This hybrid framework, called physAI, will harness real- world, free-living exercise data from the T1Dexi project (Big Data). In our second aim, we will leverage decades of research into deep learning with the Big Data provided by the T1Dexi project to train an AI-based decision support system that gives treatment recommendations to help users maintain target glucose during exercise. In our third aim, we will assess the safety and usability of our decision support engine in a small proof-of-concept study with human participants, supported by the Sponsor. This will be the first decision support system specifically designed to provide treatment recommendations that help users maintain safe glucose levels while performing aerobic and resistance exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 diabetes is difficult to manage during exercise, and few validated tools exist to recommend treatment options to avoid dangerous complications resulting from low blood glucose. This proposal combines physiological modelling and deep learning to develop a novel artificial intelligence decision support system to help multiple daily injection users maintain safe blood glucose levels during and after exercise. We will build and validate this system in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Leveraging Big Data and Deep Learning to Develop Next Generation Decision Support Tools to Improve Glycemic Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes,10231944,F30DK128914,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerobic', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carbohydrates', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Cutaneous', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Food', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Injections', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intake', 'Jogging', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physical Exercise', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Production', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Structure of beta Cell of islet', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'base', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'exercise regimen', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose uptake', 'glycemic control', 'human model', 'human study', 'improved', 'in silico', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'resistance exercise', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'smartphone Application', 'strength training', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. This project will use and customize the state-of- the-art artificial intelligence techniques to develop an intelligent treatment planning system that is capable of efficiently and consistently generating high quality plans.",Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy,10190850,R01CA237269,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Beds', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Consultations', 'Curiosities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Generations', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individuality', 'Intelligence', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'negative affect', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,490133
"Personalizing AAV Management by Leveraging Big Data: Targeting Complication Clusters PROJECT SUMMARY ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a small vessel vasculitis associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to reduced quality of life and excess mortality compared to the general population. In the context of improving rates of flare and mortality with contemporary treatments, increasing attention is shifting to complications (e.g., renal failure, infection, cardiovascular disease) as clinically-relevant and patient-oriented outcomes. However, our understanding of how best to address and prevent complications is limited because they are typically studied in isolation from a “single disease framework.” We do not understand how complications tend to co-occur in individuals in complication clusters. Moreover, with several available treatment options for AAV, comparative effectiveness studies using real-world experience data and relevant outcomes like complication clusters are needed to guide treatment decisions in a manner that personalizes care, improves quality of life, and reduces mortality. However, we do not have the methods to accurately and efficiently assemble an AAV cohort using state-of-the-art algorithms that leverage heterogeneous claims and electronic health record (EHR) data. The aims of this proposal are to (1) apply advanced clinical informatics methods (i.e., machine learning and natural language processing) to identify AAV cases in big data to assemble a large cohort and (2) determine complication clusters in an AAV cohort by applying latent transition analysis. To achieve these aims, we will leverage methodologic expertise developed through collaborations established during the PI’s K23 and use a novel data source that includes EHR data linked to Medicare and Medicaid claims. The PI’s team has previously demonstrated that unstructured (i.e., free-text) EHR data can be used to study topics mentioned in clinical notes of AAV patients and that keywords in these notes can help identify AAV patients but neither machine learning nor sophisticated natural language processing have been previously used to identify AAV cases. In addition, our prior work has examined AAV complications in isolation (e.g., renal disease, cardiovascular disease) but here we seek to identify phenotypes of complications (complication clusters) that tend to co-occur in patients, how patients transition between clusters over time, and what factors predict a person’s membership in a complication cluster. The major goal of this proposal is to build further preliminary data in preparation for an R01 application over the next 24 months. The planned R01 will focus on comparative effectiveness studies in AAV using cohorts assembled in big data and clinically-relevant, patient-oriented outcomes, like complication clusters. The results of these studies can then be used as inputs in simulation models built during my K23 to guide optimal patient-oriented treatment decisions. Ultimately, the goal of this research program is to improve quality of life and reduce complications and mortality by using data to inform personalized approaches to AAV treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite treatment advances, ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) remains associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to a reduced quality of life and an increased risk of death compared to the general population. To further improve these outcomes, we need to understand which medications work best to treat AAV and this requires a large group of patients to study and a better understanding of complications in AAV.

"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, signal processing and biological physics. This project is likely to reveal novel multiscale AF phenotypes to enable personalized therapy. Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem that affects 2-5 million Americans, causing stroke, rapid heart beats, heart failure and even death. In this project, the applicant will apply numerical analysis and machine learning to detailed data acquired from patients undergoing therapy, to better define individual biological types of AF, which may provide a foundation for personalized patient-tailored diagnosis and therapy.",Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation,10130617,R01HL149134,"['Ablation', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dizziness', 'Drug Controls', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'heart rhythm', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'voice recognition', 'voltage']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,771584
"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,10087958,R01LM013061,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'feature selection', 'health data', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'risk prediction', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'vector']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,455669
"Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A major challenge in caring for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is determining the optimal therapy. Several effective biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are available for RA, reflecting both advances in therapy, and the heterogeneity of RA; subsets of patients respond while others do not. Prior studies focused on patients with a good response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), the most common bDMARD, with limited success in finding predictors that can be used in clinical care. This proposal seeks to address that gap in knowledge by taking a different direction. The objective of this study is to focus on exceptional bDMARD non-responders, defining and characterizing patients who have been on ≥3 classes of bDMARDs for RA. We will test whether data available in clinical electronic health record data (EHR) or genomic data can identify exceptional non-responders from TNFi responders. In Aim 1, we leverage data from an EHR cohort of ~16K RA patients to determine clinical factors associated with exceptional non-response using traditional epidemiologic approaches. As well, we will apply approaches using machine learning and topic modeling that will enable us to evaluate the predictiveness of a broader range of features. Examples of features include billing codes, prescriptions, and medical concepts extracted from text notes using natural language processing. In Aim 2, we will test whether RA genetic risk factors available in a subset of patients in Aim 1, and those of other inflammatory arthritides, e.g. axial spondyloarthropathy, can predict exceptional non- response to bDMARD therapy. As part of aim 2, we will also incorporate any predictive clinical factors identified in Aim 1 through the traditional or topic modeling approach. The overarching hypothesis is that the exceptional non-responders may be less “RA-like” than patients who respond to TNFi, with fewer RA genetic risk alleles and classic RA features from the narrative notes. This definition provides a new way to sub- phenotype RA, focusing on those that will have a poor response to therapy. This study is significant because a screen will be helpful not only in the clinic but can also identify patients to target for future studies of novel drug targets. This approach is innovative because it considers contemporary data where patients now have more “opportunity” to fail 3 classes of bDMARDs, where in the past there were only a limited number available. These data will be examined both using traditional epidemiologic models and newer approaches such as topic modeling that can integrate a broader range of data types. Finally, this proposal is designed to anticipate a time when patients will come for their visit with genetic data as part of their medical record. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune joint disease worldwide. In line with NIAMS’ mission to conduct research in the treatment of arthritis, this proposal will investigate approaches using recent data and state-of-the-art approaches to improve RA management.

"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination  Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases. PROJECT SUMMARY Care delivery at primary and urgent clinics is critically hindered by doctor shortage, time constraints and the inappropriate use of infrastructures. The rising aging population and unhealthy lifestyle are expected to drive the increase of chronic disease and the national health expenditures associated (20% of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025). Telemedicine has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce the cost of access to care minimizing the dependence of patients on health professionals. However, current solutions that connect patients with doctors don’t allow accurate diagnosis due to the lack or inappropriate use of medical devices. AdviNOW proposes to implement computer vision to offer a clinically reliable approach to perform self- evaluation of vital parameters. AdviNOW is developing the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms to guide any non-trained people to correct usage of Class 2 medical devices at the point of need. The new approach will represent the core component of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) which will be integrated into telemedicine platforms, kiosks or any medical office to automate medical visits, improving the management of chronic diseases. In Phase I, we validated the feasibility of our product by developing a module for heart stethoscope exams. Users were able to autonomously take a phonocardiogram measurement in <8 seconds, while the system verified the correct use of the device. In this Phase II project, the additional modules required for a minimum viable product (MVP) with significant clinical and commercial impact will be developed. This will include modules for Respiratory Auscultation, Otoscopic Ear Examination, Mouth Examination, and temperature control. The developed modules will be then integrated within the current front-end structure. The MVP will be validated in a clinical setting, where its usability, benefits, and clinical effectiveness will be assessed. Additionally, the platform will be integrated with major providers of Electronic Health Records. At the end of this SBIR Phase II project, an MVP ready to enter the market will have been fully developed. Future R&D efforts of AdviNOW Medical will be aimed at the development of Artificial Intelligence based diagnosis of abnormal medical conditions from self-measured biometric parameters. The mission of AdviNOW Medical is to develop a disruptive solution for the delivery of healthcare that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, and available in centralized and decentralized locations. By reducing the time for routine analysis, the actual doctor-patient encounter will be more meaningful, improving the clinical outcome as well as patient satisfaction. This invention promises to disrupt healthcare, as providers will improve cost management and profitability by visiting more patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE New strategies for accurate and efficient delivery of healthcare to chronic disease patients are required. This project will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms which will guide patients to use Class II medical devices for self-assessment of vital parameters to monitor the health status of chronic conditions. The project is expected to introduce a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) to Primary and Urgent care clinics and remote settings to allow improved medical outcomes and cost management of chronic diseases.",Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases.,10139479,R44NR018631,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Augmented Reality', 'Auscultation', 'Automation', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decentralization', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Injectable', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Oral cavity', 'Otoscopes', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Self Assessment', 'Self-Examination', 'Site', 'Site Visit', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stethoscopes', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thermometers', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging population', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical decision support', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'invention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'product development', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'sound', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'urgent care', 'usability', 'volunteer']",NINR,"ADVINOW, INC.",R44,2021,776150
"DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES ABSTRACT Anti-TNF therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic inflammation of the digestive system which presents both an economic burden as well as prominent disability and morbidity. These therapies, however, are largely ineffective in IBD patients, with primary non- response rates varying from 10-30%, and with 23-46% of patients losing response over time. They also lead to adverse health outcomes including increased risk of infections (most notably reactivation of tuberculosis), liver problems, arthritis, and lymphoma. Due to biologic switching where multiple drugs are tried in sequence until an effect is observed, they often lead to overall increased healthcare costs. There is no clear predictive factor of response or loss of response to anti-TNF therapies, with current research focusing on efficacious dosage and inhibitor selection. While numerous predictors of response have been identified in studies, none are robust enough to impact clinical practice. Overcoming this gap in the administration of anti-TNF therapies will be an important next step in improving their utility and reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality. This project proposes a multicohort meta-analysis and machine learning approach to discover and validate a prognostic gene signature that can differentiate anti-TNF responders from non-responders in IBD patients, allowing for improved decision-making and positive health outcomes. Despite the broad biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity inherent in such a task, the Inflammatix analytical framework was able to identify significant differentially expressed genes that discriminate anti-TNF responders from non-responders (mean discovery AUC of ~0.83 and mean validation AUC of ~0.81). Supported by these preliminary results, this project will (1) discover a robust, clinically translatable multi-gene prognostic signature using publicly available datasets, (2) generate independent gene expression data from retrospective cohorts of mucosal biopsy samples (n=150) to validate the signature (target AUC > ~0.8), and (3) use our proprietary Inflammatix machine learning (IML) platform to train and validate a plethora of machine learning algorithms to develop a robust, generalizable classifier (target AUC ~ 0.8 - 0.9) that is ready for clinical validation via prospective studies. Our novel prognostic signature will transform the clinical paradigm in the use and administration of anti-TNF therapies, maximizing treatment benefit while minimizing patient exposure to potentially harmful side effects and adverse health outcomes, consequently reducing financial burden for the healthcare system and patient. NARRATIVE Anti-TNF therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however, they are ineffective in greater than half of patients, and carry significant risks with associated healthcare costs. This project will discover and validate a prognostic, generalizable mRNA signature that can identify IBD patients who are likely to respond to anti-TNF treatment, transforming how physicians use and administer these expensive and oftentimes risk-laden therapies to maximize patient benefit and minimize adverse health outcomes. Improved treatment decision-making will undoubtedly help address ever-increasing cases of IBD in the US and globally while reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality.",DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES,10138841,R43DK127578,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Colonoscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Robin bird', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'TNF gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'acute infection', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'clinical development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically translatable', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'dosage', 'gastrointestinal system', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multilayer perceptron', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'service providers', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,"INFLAMMATIX, INC.",R43,2021,251371
"Rapid platelet dysfunction detection in whole blood samples using machine learning powered micro-clot imaging. Abstract This project will optimize a point-of-care (POC) platelet force monitoring technology for clinical application in trauma care. The leading causes of death and disability after trauma are related to hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Platelets are critical to hemostasis by inducing clot formation via adhesion, aggregation, and contraction at wounds. Platelets often become dysfunctional after trauma which worsens internal bleeding and ICH progression and increasing morbidity. POC platelet assays have not been incorporated in practice due to:1) lack of large cohort ED patient testing; 2) poor accuracy in transfusion prediction and 3) extended processing times. We have made an innovative POC technology to test platelet function by directly measuring platelet contractile forces on microfluidic force sensors. Advantages of our POC test vs. existing assays: 1) rapid, direct activation and measures of platelet functions and 2) innovative machine vision with deep potential for machine learning insight. However, this technology needs optimization and validation in a large major ED trauma cohort and remains untested after ICH. Our pilot data suggests platelet contractile forces are sensitive to a range of relevant activation pathways and mechanisms and force is significantly decreased in trauma patients requiring blood transfusion. Further, in prior clinical trials, platelet transfusion has been found to be harmful when used indiscriminately. Building on this unmet scientific need, we will determine if our POC technology is predictive of hemorrhagic complications in trauma patients, informing a personalized transfusion strategy. Our overarching hypothesis is our POC platelet force monitor technology is an efficient indicator of bleeding complications after trauma and ICH. Aim 1: Optimize the platelet force monitor optics to improve platelet force sensor performance. We hypothesize the addition of a second fluorescent imaging channel can improve our current platelet force sensor performance. Aim 2: Use machine learning (ML) image analysis to improve detection of platelet dysfunction and prediction of trauma outcomes. We hypothesize image-based ML models can improve test performance. We will compare the accuracy of direct platelet force measurements (Aim 1) vs. ML-enhancement measurements for detecting platelet dysfunction and predicting outcomes. Aim 3: Validate our platelet function algorithm for predicting blood transfusion needs, mortality, and the progression of traumatic ICH in a prospective cohort of severely-injured ED trauma patients. We hypothesize platelet force will be a powerful predictor of blood transfusion needs, mortality, and progression of ICH. In the ED we will apply our algorithm (both the original and optimized algorithm from Aim 1) to blood from trauma patients and compare the predicted transfusion requirements against actual transfusion (Aim-3a) and measure the association between measured platelet force and ICH progression (Aim-3b). Project Narrative Rapidly identifying patients who are at risk for traumatic internal and intracranial bleeding would improve care by enabling personalized transfusion strategies. The current clinical approach causes undue morbidity and mortality because of late identification of those in need of a transfusion, resulting in delayed blood transfusion in those patients who would benefit, and unnecessary transfusions in those who would not. The proposed project improves and validates an innovative blood testing technology which has shown the potential to make rapid bleeding assessment of every patient both easy and accurate.",Rapid platelet dysfunction detection in whole blood samples using machine learning powered micro-clot imaging.,10146213,R61HL156508,"['ADP Receptors', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Arachidonic Acids', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Care Technology Points', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Electrons', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Platelet Function Tests', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Prospective cohort', 'Receptor Inhibition', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Traumatic intracranial hemorrhage', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'blood product', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic technologies', 'disability', 'flexibility', 'fluorescence imaging', 'force sensor', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'microsensor', 'mortality', 'nanonewton', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'platelet function', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'seal', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'shear stress', 'trauma care', 'wound']",NHLBI,STASYS MEDICAL CORPORATION,R61,2021,294185
"A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data SUMMARY: A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict AAA Prognosis  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the aorta. If left untreated AAA may go on to rupture, an occurrence which has a 90% mortality rate and is the 13th leading cause of death in the United States, with more than 15,000 annual deaths reported annually. After AAA is diagnosed, a clinician must determine its severity; i.e., the relative risk of rupture compared to the risk of intervention. Current clinical guidelines for this determination is based on the one-size-fits-all “maximum diameter criterion”, which states that when a AAA reaches 5.5 cm in diameter, the risk of rupture necessitates repair of the aneurysm. However, smaller sized AAAs (< 5.5 cm) have been seen to rupture at rates of up to 23.4%, demonstrating that this diameter-based criterion is unsuitable for AAA management. A recently completed NIH-funded clinical trial, 1U01-AG037120: “Non-Invasive Treatment of AAA Clinical Trial” (N-TA3CT) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of pharmacologic treatment of small AAA. During this trial, a highly unique and valuable dataset was collected longitudinally every 6 months for a 3-year period for patients presenting with small AAA.  This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that, at the time of discovery of small AAA, clinical prognosis – i.e., predicting if and when clinical intervention will be required based on rupture risk metrics – can be facilitated using machine learning-based algorithms using real-time biomechanical, morphological, and clinical data. To address this hypothesis, we will pursue two specific aims.  Aim 1 will be to quantify the “evolution” of individual small AAA from the N-TA3CT trial. The biomechanical and morphological status of all patient AAAs at each timepoint will be determined from data collected during the trial using finite element analysis and morphometric analysis, respectively, and these will be tabulated along with clinical indices for each AAA at each timepoint.  Aim 2 will be to develop and validate machine learning and regression techniques to forecast the clinical prognosis of small AAA. The data from Aim 1 as well as follow-up reporting data from the N- TA3CT trial will be used to train machine learning classification models to determine whether aneurysm prognosis can be accurately predicted. Validation will be performed on a subset of data to assess the accuracy, sensitivity, precision and specificity of the proposed prediction model.  The unique dataset from the N-TA3CT trial, paired with the extensive experience of and methods developed by our lab, will allow us, for the first time, to carefully examine and quantify the natural evolution of small AAA and to subsequently develop a predictive model to improve patient prognosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, when clinicians must decide if or when to fix an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA; characterized by the ballooning of a thin and weakened wall), they base their decision solely on the AAA diameter. However, a quarter of AAA below the accepted cutoff diameter still rupture, often leading to death. In this project, we will use a unique database collected during a clinical trial of small AAA, computer models, and machine learning to create a new decision method that will better serve patients with this disease.",A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data,10115365,R21HL156246,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Aneurysm', 'Annual Reports', 'Aorta', 'Biomechanics', 'Caliber', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilatation - action', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'rate of change', 'repaired', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,117375
"Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract Lyme Disease is a tickborne illness with markedly increasing prevalence in the United States and an urgent need for improved diagnostics in its early stages, when treatment is most efficient. While classic clinical presentation of the early illness is the presence of erythema migrans (EM), or “bullseye rash”, surrounding the tick bite site, 20-30% of patients do not present with EM. Further complicating diagnosis is a proportion of patients who present with EM, but are seronegative on the current standard two-tiered test algorithm (STTTA). The proposed research addresses the need for improved serological tests to diagnose early Lyme Disease in these patients, while the disease is the most responsive to treatment. A proof-of-concept antigen panel capable of distinguishing STTTA-positive acute Lyme samples from endemic controls was identified using a novel antigen discovery approach. This approach relies on representing an entire binding space of a donor’s circulating antibody repertoire using machine learning models based on the antibody binding profile to a diverse, random library of 126,050 peptides with an average length of 9 amino acids, which is a sparse representation of all possible amino acid combinations. Resulting models are then used to identify pathogen epitopes with high predictive power that are combined into a panel with diagnostic efficacy. Here, the unmet need of diagnosing early Lyme disease in STTTA-seronegative patients is addressed by the addition of antigens predicted as specific to this patient population. Diagnostic efficacy of the supplemented proof-of- concept antigen panel, that was identified in a previous proof-of-principle study, will be tested using an expanded cohort of STTTA seronegative donors and endemic controls. Specificity of the panel for Lyme disease will be confirmed using a panel of look-a-like illnesses including autoimmune diseases and tickborne diseases. This work is expected to yield data demonstrating the feasibility of a novel immunoassay for the diagnosis of early stage Lyme Disease patients currently missed by present tests. Additionally, it will serve as a demonstration of the antigen discovery approach as a means to identify diagnostic antigens for difficult pathogens. Project Narrative Improved diagnostics for early Lyme Disease, the most treatable stage of the disease, are urgently needed to identify infected patients, including those not presenting with the classic bullseye rash or who are seronegative on the standard two-tiered test algorithm. Here, we apply a novel antigen discovery approach that allows us to computationally model patients’ serum antibody binding profiles and predict diagnostic antigens for patients with early Lyme Disease. By developing a diagnostic assay which includes antigens specific for patients missed by current diagnostics, patient outcomes can be improved through enabling early intervention with effective treatments.",Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis,10259497,R43AI162473,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Exanthema', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Serology test', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface Antigens', 'Symptoms', 'Synthetic Antigens', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'United States', 'Work', 'antigen diagnostic', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'erythema migrans', 'falls', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular diagnostics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'synthetic peptide', 'technological innovation', 'tick bite', 'tick-borne']",NIAID,BIOMORPH TECHNOLOGIES LLC,R43,2021,300000
"Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring Abstract Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). Both hypotension and hypertension can impair the function of vital organs (e.g. brain, heart and kidneys), and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative mortality, which makes it important to detect BP changes as quickly as possible to prompt timely intervention or therapy. However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, an invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection. In the United States, about 80,000 blood stream infections caused by an arterial catheter are reported annually. Due to the inherent risks associated with a-line, it is used only for clinically indicated high risk surgeries or ICU patients. As a result of the a-line risks and discomforts, even though more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, only a small portion receive continuous BP monitoring. In addition, although vital sign (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP etc) monitoring is routine in surgical rooms and ICUs, currently most monitoring devices are fixed in individual rooms, which result in gaps in patient monitoring, accidents during patient transport process, and extra work to disconnect and reconnect sensors when leaving and entering a new facility. Seamless “continuum of care” monitoring—for instance from surgical room to ICUs, including transport in between and without reconnecting sensors—is on top of the wish list by clinician. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop portable ECG monitors and “mobile ICUs”; however so far, no continuous and seamless BP monitoring has been achieved. This proposal fully leverages the outcomes from the related R21 (EB022271) project. We will develop novel machine learning and deep learning based data fusion algorithms to use existing vital signs for continuous BP monitoring, then integrate them with our unique wearable patient monitoring system to form a novel perioperative patient monitoring system. We will test the system’s performance against gold standard a- line and Finapres BP technologies. to develop a fully functional technology for noninvasive, continuous, and seamless BP monitoring. We will also develop a public database for future BP technology development. The proposed multimodality algorithms, seamless BP monitoring system and PhysioNet database will provide major steps forward to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring. Project Narrative Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, the invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection, and current noninvasive BP technologies have poor stability. In this project we will develop novel algorithms and hardware with improved stability to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring,",Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring,10121622,R01EB027122,"['Academia', 'Accidents', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Annual Reports', 'Arterial Lines', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Brain', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Catheters', 'Clinical', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Hypotension', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temporal Arteries', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'data format', 'data fusion', 'data privacy', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infection risk', 'light weight', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient privacy', 'portability', 'privacy protection', 'recurrent neural network', 'sensor', 'surgical risk', 'technology development', 'tonometry']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,595683
"Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Abstract Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 5% of all strokes, has a high mortality and the cost to society is similar to ischemic stroke since subjects are much younger. Though SAH fatality has decreased ~50% in the last 25 years due to immediate repair of aneurysms, improved medical management and nimodipine, nearly 1/3 of SAH patients develop delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) often with cerebral infarction which is associated with poor outcomes. Though this was thought to be due delayed cerebral vasospasm, recent studies have shown that decreasing or preventing vasospasm does not improve outcomes. This has led to alternative hypotheses that combined effects of microvessel thrombosis and vasospasm combined with cortical spreading ischemia and peripheral and central inflammation may cause DCI. Thus, there is a great unmet need to assess potential treatment targets that contribute to DCI following SAH in humans and that could be used to predict DCI to begin early treatment and to predict outcome to better allocate resources. The premise of the proposal is based upon the findings that we have shown that gene expression in blood can predict SAH patients who develop vasospasm. This led us to Hypothesize that clotting and inflammatory molecules in blood interact with the brain microvasculature and other factors to cause Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) and delayed cerebral infarction following SAH which lead to poor outcomes. We propose that gene profiles in blood will predict DCI and predict outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).  R61 Phase. Specific Aim #1a: Perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on whole blood of a training cohort of patients 1, 2 and 3 days after a SAH but prior to DCI compared to matched vascular risk factor controls. Specific Aim #1b. Identify the most significantly regulated genes and pathways in blood at 1, 2 or 3d that distinguish SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days from SAH patients who do not develop DCI. Specific Aim #1c: Use WGCNA to identify key hub genes and upstream genes expressed at 1, 2 or 3d after SAH and which are associated with developing DCI at 4-14d and might be causative. Specific Aim #1d. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning to identify the least number of genes at 1, 2 or 3d from Aim #1b that best predict (1) SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days (2) and predict mRS of 0, 1-3, 4-5, and 6 at 3 months. Specific Aim #1e. Confirm RNAseq with qRT-PCR and assess qRT-PCR accuracy and precision. R33 Phase. Specific Aim #2. In a separate validation cohort of SAH patients perform qRT-PCR on their peripheral blood to measure expression of genes derived in Aim #1 to predict using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on day 1, 2 and/or day 3 which patients will develop DCI at 4-14 days and which patients will have mRS=0 (no deficit), 1-2, 3-5 and mRS=6 (dead) at 3 months.  Contexts of Use. The molecules/pathways that predict DCI and mRS could serve as future treatment or prevention targets of DCI. Predicting who will develop DCI would make it possible to treat DCI earlier. In addition, future clinical trials to prevent DCI following SAH would enroll just those patients predicted to develop DCI after SAH. Predicting mRS outcomes could be used to stratify patients in future DCI trials. Narrative  This proposal will perform RNAseq on blood of a derivation cohort of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients to determine those genes that best predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) between 4 and 14 days and that predict median Rankin Scores (mRS) outcomes at 90 days using cross-correlation. These genes are then measured in an independent validation cohort of SAH patients to predict who develops DCI by 14d, and to predict their mRS at 90 days after SAH. The studies will direct early treatment for DCI, identify treatment targets for DCI, and help stratify patients for future DCI treatment trials.",Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,10105072,R61NS119345,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aneurysm', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Catheters', 'Cerebral Infarction', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Spasm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelin Receptor Antagonist', 'Enrollment', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Nimodipine', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Prevention', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Survivors', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Thrombosis', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vasospasm', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'care costs', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'repaired', 'spreading depression', 'stroke patient', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment trial', 'vascular risk factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R61,2021,681385
"Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning This is a K23 award application for Dr. Andrew Sweatt, a pulmonary/critical care physician and young investigator at Stanford University who is establishing a niche in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) precision phenotyping. His work centers on using machine learning to reclassify PAH, where hidden patterns are detected in high-throughput molecular data to uncover new phenotypes. The existing PAH clinical classification does not inform therapy decisions, and outcomes are overall poor with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment approach. There is a critical need for molecular phenotyping efforts, to develop classification schemes that sit closer to pathobiology and identify therapeutically-targetable patient subsets. Dr. Sweatt’s K23 builds on an innovative foundational study where he used machine learning to cluster PAH patients based on blood immune profiling, without guidance from clinical features. This agnostic approach uncovered 4 immune phenotypes with distinct cytokine profiles that are independent of clinical subtypes and stratify disease risk. These findings indicate that inflammation is a viable platform for PAH reclassification. Extensive research has implicated inflammation in PAH and multiple immune-targeting therapies are under active investigation, but these studies rest on the assumption that a common pathophenotype exists. The objective of Dr. Sweatt’s K23 is to better understand PAH immune phenotypes in terms of their longitudinal evolution, mechanistic underpinnings, and therapeutic implications. First, he will perform serial cytokine profiling in two observational cohorts (Stanford, USA; Sheffield, UK) to reassess immune phenotypes during the disease course (Aim 1). Based on preliminary data, dynamic phenotype switches may occur in some patients and reflect changes in clinical disease severity. Next, he will integrate blood transcriptomic profiling and apply sophisticated computational tools to provide phenotype-specific mechanistic insights (Aim 2). He postulates that distinct transcriptomic profiles will link phenotypes to specific signaling pathways and immune cell subsets. Findings will be validated using multi-cohort data from public repositories. Finally, he will perform post-hoc cytokine profiling in two recent PAH trial cohorts where immune modulators were tested, to assess if therapy responses differ across phenotypes (Aim 3). His research could help identify patients who will respond to specific therapies, inform clinical trial designs, lead to biomarker discovery, and define novel biology in PAH. The K23 will provide Dr. Sweatt with the critical support needed to transition to an independent research career and be a leader in PAH precision phenotyping. His K23 objectives are to gain experience in PAH clinical phenotyping/cohort building, expand expertise in bioinformatics, cultivate collaboration, and translate findings to new hypotheses for R01 development. He will be guided by a committed team of multidisciplinary mentors (Roham Zamanian [expert in PAH clinical trial design/biomarkers], Marlene Rabinovitch [leader in translational PAH research], and Purvesh Khatri [pioneer in bioinformatics]) and scientific advisors (Mark Nicolls [translational PAH immunology], PJ Utz [immunology], and Manisha Desai [biostatistics]). NARRATIVE This proposed research is aimed at classifying novel subtypes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), by studying inflammation in the blood of patients (complex protein and genetic profiles) and using sophisticated computational methods (machine learning and systems-based network analysis) to find data patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. This research is relevant to public health as the burden of morbidity and mortality is high in PAH, and the current system used to classify patients does not inform treatment decisions. Our project has significant potential to improve public health, as it may yield a PAH classification scheme that sits closer to underlying pathobiology, provide a critical step toward identifying patients who will respond to specific therapies, help improve the design of forthcoming clinical trials, and create a framework for precision medicine.",Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning,10192823,K23HL151892,"['Address', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Growth Factor', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunomodulators', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mononuclear', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Public Health', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'chemokine', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'data repository', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'protein complex', 'public repository', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'trend']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193536
"Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment. PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid overdose rates have risen six-fold since the late 1990s and presently claim the lives of over 130 Americans each day. Amongst treatment options for opioid dependence, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with opioid substitutes, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, are the only treatments for which effectiveness has been confirmed by empirical study. While methadone maintenance is effective for reducing mortality over the course of treatment, individuals remain at significant risk of overdose death during the initial phase of treatment (methadone induction). On the other hand, although buprenorphine has lower risk of mortality, it is associated with greater risk of withdrawal and relapse. Therefore, patient monitoring is critical for effective MAT, improved treatment retention and reduced likelihood of overdose death. Yet, MAT is most commonly administered on an outpatient basis, limiting the time periods during which the patient can be actively assessed. OpiAID is developing the Strength Band Platform, a wearable device featuring a multi-sensor array and artificial intelligence to facilitate patient monitoring during MAT for opioid use disorder. This device will provide an expanded range of biometric variables enabling prediction of opioid use and withdrawal in real world settings. Real-time monitoring of patients will allow appropriate and timely interventions, directly improving the outcomes for the patients undergoing the treatment. There are currently no FDA approved, commercially available, wearable products for monitoring opioid use in real world settings. This Phase I SBIR program consists of two Specific Aims designed to develop the Strength Band Platform using a commercially available clinically validated armband. The first Specific Aim is to collect biometric variables from patients and develop prediction algorithms through supervised learning. In the second Specific Aim, barriers to end-user adoption, compliance and social stigma will be identified through focus groups and solutions based on the feedback will be incorporated into development frameworks. Completion of this Phase I project will produce a proof-of-concept platform which will undergo further development and evaluation for commercialization. Phase II research will focus on developing fully functional user and practitioner interfaces and completing multi-region clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness of the platform for improving patient outcomes. OpiAID will leverage extensive partnerships in the opioid dependence treatment community in Wilmington, NC to evaluate performance of the device and complete the clinical trials. Ultimately, identifying periods of increased risk of relapse will allow provision of just-in-time interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE To address the opioid crisis, OpiAID is developing a wearable biometric device platform that will predict use and withdrawal in patients undergoing medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder. Using a wearable device for real-time monitoring with predictive capability will allow timely interventions resulting in fewer deaths and relapses.","Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment.",10339121,R43DA050399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Maintenance', 'Methadone', 'Monitor', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid Rotation', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'methadone treatment', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'overdose death', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'relapse risk', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'supervised learning', 'wearable device']",NIDA,"OPIAID, LLC",R43,2021,55000
"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,10149998,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Movements', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Visualization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'former smoker', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'respiratory morbidity', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2021,185497
"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,10299634,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'fractionated radiation', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,H.

"Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Critically injured patients have a four-fold higher risk of death from medical errors than other hospitalized patients, with nearly half of preventable deaths related to errors during the initial resuscitation phase. Although protocols, simulation, and leadership training improve team performance in this setting, as many as 12 protocol deviations per resuscitation have been observed, even with experienced teams. Given adverse outcomes that can result from performance gaps, there is a critical need to establish novel approaches for applying real-time decision support in critical-care settings. The long-term goal is to implement decision support for trauma resuscitation and other fast-paced, high-risk critical care settings that improves performance, reduces errors, and prevents adverse outcomes. The overall objective for this renewal is to vertically advance what was achieved during the first funding period by designing, implementing and testing an intention-aware recommender system that (1) recognizes and tracks current goals using sensor data, the output from patient monitors, and data captured from digital devices, (2) derives recommendations that support adherence to goal- based protocols, and (3) displays these recommendations in real time on wall displays. The central hypothesis is that decision support aligning with intentions (“intended” or “current” goals) will enhance protocol compliance, leading to improved outcomes related to trauma resuscitation. The rationale for this renewal is that recommendations supporting protocol compliance that are aligned with team intentions are more likely to be adopted by being less distracting and associated with lower cognitive load. Guided by preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) design and implement an automated real- time approach for predicting and monitoring the assessment and treatment goals of trauma resuscitation; and 2) generate and display a recommended plan of activities that supports current goal pursuit during trauma resuscitation. For the first Aim, machine learning approaches will be applied for recognizing goals using data obtained from sensors and other digital data sources. Under the second Aim, a machine learning strategy will be implemented and tested that generates recommendations responsive to team intentions. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on development of real-time methods that integrate goals as an input for making recommendations that meet the most current and relevant information needs. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to improve the care of severely injured and other critically ill patients by promoting timely and appropriate achievement of critical assessment and treatment goals in settings that remain at high-risk for medical errors. The results of this research continuum are expected to have an important positive impact on the outcome by addressing the mismatch between complex decision-making and human vulnerability to error that remain in critical care settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is relevant to public health because it focuses on the design and implementation of a novel real-time decision support system that will reduce errors associated with adverse patient outcomes by providing recommendations that support the current information needs of multidisciplinary trauma teams. The proposed project is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission related to development of biomedical communications systems, methods, and technologies, and information dissemination and utilization among health professionals.",Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes,10163257,R01LM011834,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Information Dissemination', 'Injury', 'Intention', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'simulation', 'success']",NLM,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,654500
"Data-Driven Phenotyping of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Project Summary This predoctoral fellowship will provide the applicant (Hayley Falk), a doctoral candidate in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan, with the skills necessary to become an independent research investigator with expertise in novel applications of machine learning for TBI. The limited accuracy of current models for early prediction of GCS 3-8 TBI (commonly referred to as severe TBI) outcomes (prognostic models) is a major barrier to improving the clinical care of patients with GCS 3-8 TBI. Less than 20% of patients with GCS 3-8 TBI experience a good neurologic recovery and currently there are no therapeutic agents that improve long-term outcomes. In GCS 3-8 TBI clinical trials of promising therapeutic agents, a favorable outcome is typically defined as a better outcome than would be expected, taking into account the predicted prognosis for each individual patient. Therefore, accurate estimation of predicted prognosis is critical to assessing the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents. The leading prognostic models for GCS 3-8 TBI, IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI) and CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury), have undergone extensive external validation, however, the discriminative accuracy is highly cohort dependent with AUCs as low as 0.60 in some patient groups. The two major limitations of the IMPACT and CRASH models include one-time measurements of clinical predictor variables and regression-based methods, which are not designed to handle complex, multidimensional datasets. Our objective is to derive a dynamic prognostic model which provides updated outcome predictions as new data becomes available. We will then develop a clustering algorithm to identify physiologically distinct subtypes (clusters) of GCS 3-8 TBI derived from continuous, high frequency data streams. Our proposed goals will be achieved by the following specific aims: 1) we will derive a dynamic prognostic model using a RNN (recurrent neural network)-based framework and data collected during the first two weeks post-injury from BOOST-2 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Phase 2) which provides updated 6-month outcome predictions every 24 hours; and 2) using time series hierarchical clustering and continuous measures of physiologic parameters collected from subjects enrolled in BOOST-2 during the first two weeks post-injury, we will identify distinct subtypes of GCS 3-8 TBI and examine the association between subtype and 6-month outcome. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that our dynamic prognostic model derived from time-varying data will have a higher discriminative accuracy (AUC) than a static prognostic model (similar to IMPACT and CRASH) derived using single timepoint data collected on the day of injury. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that subtypes of GCS 3-8 TBI characterized by continuous physiologic parameters such as increasing ICP (intracranial pressure), decreasing CPP (cerebral perfusion pressure), and decreasing PbtO2 (brain tissue oxygenation) will be associated with poor 6-month outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed project aims to address the limitations of current prognostic models for GCS 3-8 TBI using state- of-the-art machine learning techniques including RNNs (recurrent neural networks) and time series hierarchical clustering. Using time-varying data collected during the first two weeks post-injury from GCS 3-8 TBI subjects enrolled in BOOST-2 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Phase 2), we will use a RNN-based framework to derive a dynamic prognostic model which improves upon the accuracy of existing static TBI prognostic models and a time series hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify distinct subtypes (clusters) of GCS 3-8 TBI derived from continuous physiologic parameters and examine the association between subtype and 6-month outcome. We will validate and refine the models developed using BOOST-2 data and data from a cohort of subjects enrolled in BOOST-3.",Data-Driven Phenotyping of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury,10230403,F31NS118944,"['Address', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cerebral perfusion pressure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coma', 'Complex', 'Craniocerebral Trauma', 'Data', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'data streams', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'long short term memory', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'neurological recovery', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pre-doctoral', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'skills', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'tissue oxygenation']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2021,37988
"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",10064003,R00HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'survivorship', 'tenure track', 'unstructured data', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R00,2021,249000
"Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS Abstract  Ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) of the breast are a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions that are usually detected by screening mammography. Workup generally includes a percutaneous (core) Biopsy (Bx) for histologic confirmation, followed by multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), followed by breast-conserving excision, and adjuvant radiation. Approximately 20-25% of patients with core Bx-confirmed DCIS are upstaged to invasive carcinoma upon pathology of resected tissue. Foreknowledge of this would dictate a more aggressive surgical intervention, including sentinel node biopsy for axillary staging. Further, another 20-25% of patients are judged to have low-risk disease and current thought is that such women may have better outcomes in an active surveillance setting, and this is being tested in clinical trials. The ultimate goal and the overall impact of this project is to use machine learning to identify biochemical (SA1) or imaging (SA2) biomarkers, as well as their combination (SA3) to discriminate indolent from aggressive DCIS, as determined by upstaging upon excisional biopsy.  The major hypothesis to be tested in this work is that hypoxia and expression of hypoxia-related proteins (HRPs) can discriminate aggressive from more indolent DCIS, and that this can be used for decision support. Expression of HRPs is optimally characterized by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and we have deployed methods for multiplexed IHC, as well as methods for advanced analytics using machine learning (pathomics). We have also shown that hypoxic habitats within breast cancers can be identified from mpMRI using machine learning (radiomics). We thus propose to use pathomics of core biopsies and radiomics of mpMRI to determine the presence and extent of hypoxic habitats in DCIS prior to surgery to predict subsequent upstaging after surgical resection. This work will be performed in Aim 1 for pathomics and Aim 2 for radiomics, and Aim 3 will develop combined radio-pathomics predictors. Each aim will contain: (a) retrospective arms for training, tuning, and testing; and (b) prospective internal and external cohorts for rigorous validation. For the retrospective studies, we have identified 604 cases wherein women with DCIS obtained core Bx, mpMRI, and surgery with pathology at Moffitt in the last 10 years. Internal prospective studies will accrue ~6 women/month who have consented to the total Cancer Care® protocol and who have their complete workup at Moffitt. External validation cohorts will be accrued at UCSF and at Advent Health.  At the end of this work we will have developed a risk model for DCIS that can be deployed prior to surgery to guide decisions along the spectrum from active surveillance at one end to more extensive surgical intervention at the other. This is expected to lay a foundation for subsequent interventional trials. Additionally, the inclusion of hypoxia as a central hypothesis has high potential to illuminate components of the natural history of this disease. Narrative  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies of the breast and data are lacking with regard to optimal treatment. Consequently, the majority of DCIS are treated in the same manner: i.e. surgery +/- radiation +/- hormonal therapy that results in either over- or under-treatment of many patients. In the current work we will test the hypothesis that histologic or radiologic markers prior to surgery can guide decision support by identifying predicting up-staging and pathological risk scoring following surgical excision.",Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS,10120171,R01CA249016,"['Acidosis', 'Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Axilla', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinoma', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consent', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Excision biopsy', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Indolent', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Methods', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radio', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resected', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'arm', 'base', 'breast malignancies', 'cancer care', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'disease natural history', 'disorder risk', 'hormone therapy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic', 'optimal treatments', 'practical application', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,H.

"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,10205954,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat veteran', 'computational platform', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data repository', 'data sharing', 'demographics', 'diverse data', 'feature selection', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'heterogenous data', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,501996
"Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million individuals in the US and over 300 million adults worldwide. The disease is characterized by joint pain and functional limitations and is associated with poor health- related quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. OA of the hips and knees ranks as the 11th highest contributor to global disability. Despite the clinical and economic impact of knee OA, no disease-modifying agents are currently available; current treatments are limited to symptom control and are only modestly efficacious. While several promising treatments are in the pipeline, developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We urgently need to identify the right patient for the right treatment to ensure that new therapies are being tested on the appropriate population. This proposal aims to use machine learning methods to address gaps in our understanding of disease heterogeneity in knee OA. We will use publicly available data from the FNIH OA Biomarkers Consortium project. This study of 600 subjects with knee OA includes over 200 parameters that describe the joint structure and disease severity, including measures of cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and inflammation. An unsupervised learning approach using model-based clustering will be used to distinguish disease phenotypes. To implement phenotyping in practice a minimal set of biomarkers must be identified that meets the challenges of both predictive accuracy and feasibility. Thus the second aim will investigate variable selection methods in model-based clustering in order to identify important variables and develop a prediction model to determine phenotype. Finally, a supervised machine learning approach via super learning will investigate algorithms to predict disease progression. The applicant, Dr. Jamie Collins, is a biostatistician at the Orthopedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Collins is a committed investigator in rheumatology research with eight first author publications in the field. She holds a career development award from the Rheumatology Research Foundation and pilot funding from the Brigham Research Institute. This proposal will provide protected time and rigorous training so that the applicant can expand her current biostatistical skill set to encompass the burgeoning fields of data science and machine learning. She will take coursework at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and will have access to courses, seminars, and training provided by the Brigham Research Institute and the Harvard Catalyst Program. The applicant will be supported by mentorship from Drs. Elena Losina and Tuhina Neogi, and input from the advisory committee of Drs. Tianxi Cai, Jeffrey Duryea, Ali Guermazi, Tina Kapur, Virginia Kraus, Katherine Liao, and Kurt Spindler. The research and training proposed in this award will address critical research gaps in our understanding of OA heterogeneity and progression. This will set Dr. Collins on the path towards independence and her long-term career objective of being an independent investigator with a focus on applying advanced analytic methods in OA research. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disabling disease that affects millions of people worldwide; there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies capable of providing symptom control and arresting structural progression.

"Predictive Analytics in Hemodialysis: Enabling Precision Care for Patient with ESKD ABSTRACT End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies, with 25% dying within 1 year and 41% surviving at least 5 years. While providers recognize that patients are different – and ought to be differently – there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy and aid in treatment individualization. Instead, providers are left with often unclear or incomplete guidelines on how best to manage patients. In order to provide precision care for patients on hemodialysis (HD), there is a critical need to be able to (1) dynamically assess life expectancy for medical decision-making; and (2) identify distinct clinical phenotypes to enhance clinical monitoring and care planning. Our central hypothesis is that there is heterogeneity in patient survivorship and disease trajectory that, when known, can be used to provide more personalized and effective care. By coupling novel machine learning approaches for survival prediction with granular clinical data on HD patients, we will be able to develop the analytic tools necessary to support precision care. At the completion of this proposal we will have tools to dynamically assess a patient's life expectancy and insights into heterogeneous disease phenotypes for patients with ESKD. These tools will allow providers to make informed treatment decisions as well as lay the groundwork for further precision research into optimized patient care. NARRATIVE End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies. However, there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy. In this proposal we will develop an analytic framework for predicting patient life-expectancy allowing for the personalized study and and ultimately treatment of individuals with ESKD.",Predictive Analytics in Hemodialysis: Enabling Precision Care for Patient with ESKD,10192714,R01DK123062,"['Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hemodialysis', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Preventive', 'Preventive care', 'Provider', 'Quality-of-Life Assessment', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Update', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'personalized decision', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'survival prediction', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,520905
"Deep learning and topological approaches to identify kidney tissue features associated with adverse outcomes after nephrectomy ABSTRACT Pathologic assessment of kidney biopsy tissue remains the best predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with kidney diseases. These features are largely independent of disease etiology and are not well reflected in non- invasive tests (e.g. serum creatinine and albuminuria). Quantitative assessment of these parameters is time consuming and maybe flawed by heterogeneity of pathologic features within kidney tissue. We propose to evaluate and optimize computational image analysis approaches to support pathologic analysis of large pieces of cancer-free kidney tissue from patients who underwent nephrectomy which we have collected (n > 220). Computer-assisted analysis of glomerular phenotypes in these samples show that morphometric features in glomeruli without obvious pathology precede established pathologic changes. We hypothesize that evaluation of cancer-free kidney tissue will inform about subclinical damage in the remaining kidney which is associated with relevant pathologic and clinical parameters. We propose to assess glomeruli, arteries and tubuli, and determine the spatial inter-relationship of the assessed features within the kidney tissue. The examination of significantly larger pieces of kidney tissue than those obtained by needle biopsy allows to include 20 times more glomeruli (nephrectomy samples: avrg. 256 glomeruli/sample; needle biopsy: avrg. 13/sample) with the vast majority considered “normal appearing” as per standard pathologic criteria. In addition, these samples include a significant larger number of blood vessels (nephrectomy samples: avrg. 18 arteries/sample; needle biopsy: avrg. 1/sample) allowing a more robust evaluation of the vasculature. We propose to apply and optimize our detection and segmentation approach to detect glomeruli, arteries and tubular segments to train convolutional neural networks and use topological image analysis to automate the identification of visual and sub-visual features. In addition, we will assess the spatial relationship between individual features (glomeruli, arteries and tubular segments and features of the same category, i.e. globally sclerosed glomeruli, arteries with hyalinosis, atrophied tubuli) within the section. To determine reproducibility of our approach, we will assess a second tissue section from a separate part of the same samples. Specifically, we propose an algorithmic detection and characterization of kidney features using deep learning, a topological image analysis for discovery of novel sub-visual features in kidney tissue images and to determine spatial relatedness of these features. If successful, we will validate our analytical approach in future independent studies. For this purpose, we are already prospectively collecting kidney tissue and longitudinal clinical data from consented patients undergoing nephrectomies, allowing association of specific features with clinical relevant outcomes. LAY NARRATIVE Patients who have one kidney removed because of cancer or other reasons, are at risk of experiencing kidney failure after the surgery due to damage to the remaining kidney, but it is difficult to know why the kidney fails and how to prevent or treat it. Evaluation of kidney tissue is the best way to determine how strong or weak the kidney is at time of surgery and how to best manage kidney-related complications afterwards. We propose a detailed analysis of pieces of tissue not affected by the tumor from the removed kidney using advanced computer-assisted analysis methods (“convolutional neural networks” and “topological image analysis”) to more accurately evaluate the status of the kidney, predict what will happen to the kidney function in the future and thereby guide therapy.",Deep learning and topological approaches to identify kidney tissue features associated with adverse outcomes after nephrectomy,10229784,R21DK126329,"['Acute', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Arteries', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Vessels', 'Categories', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computer Assisted', 'Consent', 'Consumption', 'Contralateral', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Needles', 'Nephrectomy', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Serum', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tubular formation', 'Visual', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'histological stains', 'improved', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney imaging', 'morphometry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'renal damage', 'serial imaging', 'spatial relationship', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2021,234000
"Harnessing Big Data to Identify Effective Peripheral Artery Disease Treatments in Chronic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peripheral artery disease (PAD), characterized by diseased arteries to the limbs, affects 200 million people worldwide and 9 million people in the U.S. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 20 million people in the U.S. and confers a markedly higher risk for PAD. Yet patients with CKD are less likely to have revascularization procedures and are more likely to undergo lower extremity amputation than patients without CKD. In addition to a high prevalence of traditional risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, patients with CKD have other unique risk factors such as chronic inflammation or uremia, which in turn can lead to more aggressive PAD at a younger age. Therefore, patients with CKD need dedicated study. Our overarching goal is to help close these evidence gaps and address these limitations by harnessing the power of Optum Clinformatics Data Mart, which includes over 7 billion claims records on over 83 million unique lives from all 50 states spanning 2005-2019. Our secondary goal is to facilitate future PAD studies using real-world data by leveraging the power of natural language processing to improve our ability to accurately and automatically ascertain PAD from large electronic health record databases. Our innovative algorithm will be of particular importance among subgroups where clinical trial evidence is limited, such as in advanced CKD. Our proposal has the Specific Aims. Aim 1: To evaluate lower extremity revascularization in patients with non-dialysis- requiring CKD. We hypothesize that patients with CKD undergoing surgical versus endovascular revascularization will have longer initial hospitalization, but fewer subsequent major adverse limb events. AIM 2: To evaluate antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications after lower extremity revascularization in patients with non-dialysis-requiring CKD. We hypothesize that real-world patients with CKD treated with antiplatelet medications or direct oral anticoagulants after lower extremity revascularization will have higher rates of bleeding but lower rates of major adverse limb events. AIM 3: To develop an algorithm that accurately and automatically ascertains PAD from electronic health record databases. We hypothesize that a natural language processing-approach applied to diagnostic vascular testing reports will have better test performance (i.e. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) for identifying PAD than a traditional approach that uses administrative billing codes. Manual chart review will serve as the gold standard. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects millions of people around the world, causing decreased mobility, non- healing wounds, gangrene and amputations. Patients with chronic kidney disease have a higher risk for PAD and its complications, but relatively little is known about what treatments are effective in this population. Our project aims to narrow some of these knowledge gaps to improve PAD treatment practices for patients with chronic kidney disease.",Harnessing Big Data to Identify Effective Peripheral Artery Disease Treatments in Chronic Kidney Disease,10180665,R01HL151351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Anticoagulants', 'Arteries', 'Aspirin', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Mart', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gangrene', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Manuals', 'Medial', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modernization', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nephrology', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uremia', 'calcification', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'virtual']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,354432
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,10218121,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'feasibility testing', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'remote monitoring', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2021,361146
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,10188375,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2021,129913
"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",10120737,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'remote monitoring', 'remote patient monitoring', 'risk prediction', 'routine care', 'safety outcomes', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,645032
"Rethinking Electronic Fetal Monitoring to Improve Perinatal Outcomes and Reduce Frequency of Operative Vaginal and Cesarean Deliveries The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to fetal hypoxia and ischemia. Its established weaknesses include: 1) the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns and 2) the widespread use of unproven surrogates for relevant fetal hypoxic and/or ischemic injury such as umbilical arterial pH, intrapartum stillbirth, newborn Apgar scores and neonatal seizures. This technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with cerebral palsy. EFM as it is presently used in the clinical setting has been associated with an extraordinary increase in the use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. No functional algorithm has yet been developed that integrates clinical data collected in the antepartum period and during labor and any other patient specific data with the results of EFM. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of EFM data, especially under real world conditions and in real time where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in significantly decreased use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery while more precisely defining the fetus at risk for developing metabolic acidosis and long term neurologic injury. The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) of the fetal heart rate (FHR) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to oxygen deficiency, but its weaknesses almost all stem from the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns. The widespread use of this technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with severe hypoxic/ischemic neurological disorders, but it has been associated with an extraordinary increase in cesarean delivery rates. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of FHR monitoring data, especially under real world conditions where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes.

"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE About 50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain critical benefits in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and reducing all-cause mortality because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation largely due to statin-associated symptoms.

"The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony Project Summary/Abstract Despite significant advances in ventilator management, mortality from the acute respiratory distress syn- drome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high. Mechanical ventilation with large tidal volume, high pressure ven- tilation, and repeated alveolar collapse can injure the lung, called ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). Defined as the inappropriate timing and delivery of a breath in response to a patient effort, ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) may potentiate VILI. This proposal outlines a 5-year training programing including mentoring, formal didactics, and practical research experiences which positions Dr. Sottile for a successful clinical research career examining ventilator dyssynchrony (VD), its impact on ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), and its optimal management. An integrated curriculum will optimize an automated VD detection algorithm, delineate which types of VD are deleterious, and determine the ideal ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD and improve patient outcomes. This experience will provide Dr. Sottile with the necessary tools to be a leader in signal analysis, ventilator dyssynchrony, advanced mathematical modeling, and critical care research. This program will consist of formal mentoring from four renowned experts in machine learning, mechanical ventilation, critical care research, and modeling of dynamic systems. In addition, coursework in clinical sciences, machine learning, and advanced mathematical modeling will build the theoretical foundation to apply these techniques. This structured curriculum will help Dr. Sottile gain expertise in the computerized detection of VD from real-time ventilator data, the pathophysiology of VD, and the modeling of complex, temporally dynamic, biological systems. The formal curriculum will coincide with three practical experiences. First, Dr. Sottile will optimize his already developed VD identification algorithm to detect additional types of VD that may be injurious to the lung. Second, he will identify which types of VD are associated with deleterious ventilator mechanics. Finally, he will deter- mine the personalized ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD, VILI, and the negative consequences of over sedation using linear optimization and lagged linear correlation to account for the dynamic nature of patient physiology. The result of the proposed studies will develop a computerized algorithm to detect seven types of VD, identify which types of VD are most likely to propagate VILI, and determine the optimal ventilator and sedation strategies to improve individual patient outcomes. This will leave Dr. Sottile and the study team positioned to conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing computer-predicted individualized ventilator and se- dation strategies compared to the current standard of care. If successful, this will potentially to revolutionize the use of mechanical ventilation by tailoring evidenced-based therapies to the individual patient. Project Narrative Despite over 50 years of research, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts of over 10% of ICU admissions. Despite current treatment strategies focused on reducing ventilator induced lung injury through low tidal volume ventilation or prone position, mortality remains over 30%. This proposal seeks to understand how patient-ventilator interactions may propagate lung injury and will determine optimal treatment strategies to improve patient- ventilator interactions, decrease lung injury, and improve patient outcomes.","The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony",10080102,K23HL145011,"['Accounting', 'Admission activity', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dysbarism', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial', 'Esophagus', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Induction of neuromuscular blockade', 'Injury', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manometry', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prone Position', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training Programs', 'Ventilator', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'biological systems', 'career', 'computerized', 'dynamic system', 'esophagus pressure', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'lung injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized strategies', 'pressure', 'programs', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2021,169654
"Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects about 10% of older adults and accounts for a growing proportion of strokes. Lifelong oral anticoagulation, with warfarin or a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), is recommended for stroke prevention in most AF patients. However, the drugs increase the risk of bleeding and the adherence to the lifelong drug therapy is poor, leaving many patients under-treated. The recently-approved Watchman device offers an attractive alternative to lifelong drug therapy for AF stroke prevention. However, the device has been studied in only two clinical trials, both of which compared it to warfarin. Little is known about how Watchman compares with the current mainstay therapy, NOACs, or how Watchman compares with no treatment in patients who have difficulties taking anticoagulation drugs. Furthermore, for preventive treatment with a high upfront cost and some procedural risks, a personalized approach is needed to target Watchman to patients who are most likely to benefit and avoid it in those who have little to gain. Therefore, the overall objective of this project is to address these evidence gaps and develop new prediction tools to optimize the use of Watchman for AF stroke prevention. In Aim 1, we will conduct comparative effectiveness studies using a large national administrative database (OptumLabs) that contains insurance claims for over two million patients with AF of all ages and races from all 50 states with linked EHRs in a subset. The findings will provide timely evidence to address the key unanswered questions highlighted in current practice guidelines and will facilitate the design, analysis, and interpretation of future clinical trials. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate machine-learning models to predict how Watchman compares with non-invasive therapies. We will develop the models using the OptumLabs data, and validate the models in two RCTs and two large health systems’ EHRs, thereby validating models in both clinical trial and routine practice settings. The new prediction models will provide personalized estimates for the benefits and harms, and thus, engage patients in making informed choices consistent with their preferences and ease clinicians’ cognitive burden. In Aim 3, we will assess how the Watchman decisions made in contemporary practice agree with those suggested by the new prediction models. We will use machine-learning methods to identify patient and provider characteristics associated with incongruent decisions. Such findings will highlight patient and provider groups who may particularly benefit from the decision support, thereby informing future implementation and translation efforts. We have assembled a team with complementary clinical and research expertise, a solid record of successful collaboration, and extensive experience in outcomes research and prediction modeling. We also have developed a web-based decision aid that is ready to translate the prediction models to reduce unwarranted variation in care delivery, patient outcomes, and medical costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The findings will provide timely evidence to bridge the gaps between clinical trials and everyday practice. The new prediction models, once embedded in a decision aid, will bring personalized outcome estimates to shared decision making to promote evidence-based and patient-centered care. Therefore, the proposed project has great potentials to improve the care for millions of patients with AF at risk for stroke.",Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device,10074511,R01AG062436,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Hemorrhage', 'Judgment', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preventive treatment', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk-Benefit Assessment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Suggestion', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Warfarin', 'administrative database', 'care delivery', 'cognitive load', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality risk', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'practice setting', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'preservation', 'routine practice', 'shared decision making', 'stroke risk', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,493168
"ADAPT: Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention Project Summary Recent large-scale trials have shown no significant benefit of pharmacological interventions in delirium patients, and non-pharmacological approaches remain the cornerstone of delirium prevention. Among those strategies, minimizing patient immobility and circadian desynchrony are particularly difficult to implement, as their assessment is dependent on sporadic human observations. The overall objective of this application is to develop ADAPT, the Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention system using novel pervasive sensing and deep learning techniques. It will autonomously quantify patients’ mobility and circadian desynchrony in terms of nightly disruptions, light intensity, and sound pressure level. This will allow for integration of these risk factors into a dynamic model for predicting delirium trajectories. It will also enable adaptive action prompts aimed at increasing patients’ mobility, reducing nightly disruptions, optimizing ambient light, and reducing noise, based on precise real-time quantification. The rationale is that successful application of the proposed technology would augment clinical-decision making in the fast-paced ICU environment and would promote more targeted interventions. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. (1) Developing and validating an interpretable deep learning algorithm for precise and dynamic prediction of the delirium trajectory, to determine if it is more accurate in predicting delirium trajectory transitions compared to existing tools, while providing interpretable information to the physician. (2) Developing a pervasive sensing system for autonomous monitoring of mobility and circadian desynchrony, to determine if it can provide accurate assessments compared to human expert and circadian biomarkers, and if it can enrich delirium trajectory prediction when combined with clinical data. (3) Developing and evaluating prompts for adaptive delirium prevention using real-time monitoring system, to determine if the system has acceptable satisfaction and perceived benefit among ICU physicians. The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) dynamically predict precise delirium trajectory, (2) autonomously monitor mobility and circadian desynchrony risk factors in the ICU, and (3) implement adaptive preventions in real time. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and critical barriers in critical care, including (1) lack of precise and real-time delirium trajectory prediction models, (2) uncaptured aspects of mobility and circadian desynchrony, and (3) the need for novel approaches for non-pharmacological prevention. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow and early critical care intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to advancing disease diagnosis through medical applications of new tools and technologies, as the proposed research applies advanced computational methods and sensing technologies to automatically quantify and convey patient status in real-time.",ADAPT: Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention,10178157,R01NS120924,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Coma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Hospital Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'circadian', 'circadian regulation', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient mobility', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'sound', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,612618
"Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB) The introduction of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) has transformed the standard of care and elevated treatment outcome goals for young individuals experiencing the initial stages of a psychotic illness (EP). The response to treatment for EP individuals receiving CSC, however, remains highly variable. A substantial proportion show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices comprising this treatment model. Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond to treatment and published data show that expert clinicians perform no better than chance. Early identification of treatment non-responders has very high clinical significance and would inform and enhance clinical decision making during the first few months of care. Surprisingly, little research has been conducted on baseline predictors of treatment outcomes in EP individuals entering CSC. During the past two decades, considerable progress has been made using neuroimaging to investigate pathophysiological processes during the early phases of illness. Furthermore, limited data suggest that fMRI measures of brain activity and PET measures of increased dopamine synthesis are related to treatment outcomes in EP. We have recently demonstrated in a moderately large sample of EP patients entering CSC that the ability to activate the frontal parietal (FP) cognitive control network (measured using fMRI during the AX- CPT task) is a significant predictor of who will meet responder criterion after one year of CSC. We propose to replicate and extend this result by examining the predictive ability of this and two other promising MRI based measures linked to pathophysiological processes related to psychosis: 1) free water diffusion tensor imaging (FW) - a putative biomarker of neuroinflammation that is increased in EP individuals, and 2) midbrain neuromelanin (NM) scans, which index midbrain dopamine, shown to be decreased in Parkinson's disease and increased in schizophrenia. Each of these measures will be used individually to predict responder status for EP participants entering CSC. In addition to these analyses we will use novel deep learning methods to optimize the prediction of treatment response in EP individuals entering CSC and to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying these effects. Our goal is to leverage recent progress in the development of MRI based imaging biomarkers to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform treatment decision making for all patients in order to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness. A substantial proportion of early psychosis EP individuals show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices provided by coordinated specialty care (CSC). Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond and who will not. In this project we will leverage recent progress in the development of pathophysiologically informed MRI based imaging biomarkers along with novel computational image analysis, to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform clinical decision making to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness.",Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB),10194614,R01MH122139,"['Adjuvant', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clozapine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'indexing', 'ineffective therapies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuromelanin', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'psychosocial', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,710640
"BIGDATA: Causal Inference in Large-Scale Time Series Project summary Large datasets generated by hospitals could have a transformative effect on medical knowledge and patient care. Yet currently the volume of data is more likely to overwhelm clinicians and the challenges of the data can overwhelm machine learning algorithms. Intensive care units (ICUs) generate data at a resolution of seconds, for the entirety of a patient's stay. Our long-term goal is to turn these data into actionable knowledge, like risk factors for a disease, early intervention targets, and real-time information to support clinical decisions. This is a broad problem, but particularly important in ICUs, which involve high stakes decisions being made in a complex environment under time pressure. We focus in particular on understanding consciousness in adults, and neurologic status in neonates. While 7% of ICU admissions are due to loss of consciousness, and degree of consciousness is critical to evaluating prognosis, making difficult choices such as when to withdraw care, and providing early interventions to improve quality of life, there are no objective or automated assessments for consciousness (adults) or neurologic status (neonates). We have shown that unresponsive patients with brain activation were twice as likely to regain the ability to follow commands compared to unresponsive patients without such activation, yet these assessments are too time consuming for regular clinical use. However we also showed that physiological data routinely collected in ICUs can be used as a proxy to classify consciousness. It is still not known why it changes and we must be sure that the patterns we find are in fact causal to avoid treating symptoms instead of a disease or launching unsuccessful clinical trials. There have been two key barriers preventing a causal understanding of consciousness. First, variables measured for each ICU patient differ, and can differ within a patient over the course of their admission. This leads to confounding when attempting to infer causal models, and has prevented learning a single model for all patients, which limits generalizability. Second, while the challenges of medical data require new methods, researchers are rarely able to rigorously evaluate and compare them, since real-world data lacks ground truth and often cannot be shared for privacy reasons. To address these challenges, we aim 1) to develop methods that learn generalizable causal models with latent variables (by intelligently sharing and combining information across patients), 2) to develop data driven simulations methods for testing machine learning algorithms while preserving privacy, and 3) to apply these methods to neonatal and neurological ICU data. We aim to create better indicators for consciousness and to uncover causes of both neurological status in ICU and its link to long-term functional outcomes. Our work turns potential weaknesses of medical data (different variables measured across individuals) into a strength, and will enable better use of large-scale observational biomedical data for real-time treatment decisions. Project Narrative Big data can form the basis for more precise, personalized, interventions for ICU patients, but it is challenging for clinicians to integrate a large number of complex signals. Our work will allow data to guide treatment by making machine learning more accurate and providing better ways of combining insights from many patients (each of whose data may be incomplete). These will aid in understanding consciousness in neurological and neonatal ICUs.",BIGDATA: Causal Inference in Large-Scale Time Series,10123124,R01LM011826,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Altered Level of Consciousness', 'Behavior assessment', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conscious', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological status', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unconscious State', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawing Care', 'Work', 'causal model', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'effective intervention', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neonatal patient', 'neonate', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'premature', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'privacy preservation', 'respiratory', 'response', 'simulation', 'stroke patient', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NLM,STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,295006
"Synthesizing Intraoperative Multivariate Time Series with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks Project Summary/Abstract Patient safety is paramount in anesthesia. Intraoperative complications and hemodynamic instability are associated with reduced long-term survival and can lead to risks such as myocardial injury, stroke, kidney injury, and even death. Therefore, predicting and preventing intraoperative hemodynamic instability is very important in the decision-making process of anesthesia providers. An ideal pre-operative assessment system would predict, from patient information, all intraoperative complications and physiological changes before a surgical procedure begins. Predicting intraoperative hemodynamic instability during surgery requires analyzing an enormous amount of physiological data and spotting patterns in that data before adverse events occur. However, doing this requires a large volume of high-resolution intraoperative data taken directly from the physiological monitors in the operating room to train machine learning models, and these data currently are unavailable. Therefore, the research goal of this proposed training program is to generate a continuous multivariate intraoperative physiological time series that display the effects of anesthesia management using state-of-the-art mathematic tools. The generated data can provide unlimited and realistic intraoperative data to identify intraoperative complications and later build a real-time intraoperative clinical decision support system. The proposed training program has two aims. Aim 1 will enable the applicant to create a data-driven objective approach for intraoperative complication prediction and risk assessment. Key information from anesthesia pre- op assessment will be used to generate synthetic low-resolution intraoperative physiological data. This data will inform anesthesia providers of the type, timing, and range of a given patient’s intraoperative hemodynamic instability and complications before surgery. Aim 2 will enable the applicant to build a virtual database that will provide unlimited high-resolution intraoperative data to train machine learning algorithms for a future real-time intraoperative clinical decision support system. The recorded low-resolution intraoperative data and the key information from anesthesia pre-op assessment will be inputted into the second tool to upscale existing minute- resolution intraoperative data to second-resolution level for data augmentation to boost the number of available surgical cases. This K08 research program will enable the applicant to fill key knowledge gaps in applying data science in the existing low-resolution intraoperative data in medical records and non-recorded high-resolution intraoperative data displayed by anesthesia devices. The results will orient anesthesia providers and researchers in the design and implementation of data-driven perioperative prediction systems over traditional anesthesia risk assessment. Ultimately, this K08 award will provide the applicant with the senior mentorship, skills, research experience and data resources to become an independent nurse investigator after training. Project Narrative The proposed training program will enable the applicant to apply generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture to widely available pre-operative evaluation notes and data from an anesthesia information management system (AIMS) to improve patient outcomes. The training will comprise the creation of (1) one GAN framework for generating realistic synthetic low-resolution AIMS data from patient profiles in pre- operative evaluation notes and (2) The second GAN framework for generating synthetic high-resolution intraoperative physiological data from low-resolution AIMS data and patient profiles. From this, the applicant aims to (1) investigate the feasibility of using GAN architecture to improve pre-operative risk assessment and (2) create a database for intraoperative high-resolution multivariate time series gathered from both low- resolution AIMS data and pre-operative evaluation notes, which can be used to train machine learning algorithms for a future real-time intraoperative clinical-decision support system designed to assist anesthesia providers deliver safer care.",Synthesizing Intraoperative Multivariate Time Series with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,10188838,K08GM141489,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator Award', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Display', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Science', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Intraoperative Complications', 'Intraoperative Monitoring', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nurses', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Science', 'Series', 'Spottings', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'myocardial injury', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'risk prediction', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2021,189794
"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG.

"Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for an NIMH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) entitled ""Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia."" In this application, Dr. Miklos Argyelan proposes a comprehensive plan for transitioning into an independent translational researcher focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of treatment response in schizophrenia by integrating functional neuroimaging with neuromodulatory bioelectric treatment approaches. Despite its effectiveness and intensive research, the mechanism of action for ECT remains unknown, and currently no clinical or biological biomarkers exist to predict response. In patients with schizophrenia undergoing a trial of ECT (with bitemporal electrode placement), the proposed study will use resting-state functional MRI, as well as electrical field modeling as applied to structural MRI scans, to examine the neural circuitry underlying clinical response. Patients will undergo MRI scanning at baseline, and after the 8th ECT treatment. Results of this proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for schizophrenia with higher efficacy. Identifying target mechanisms would not only improve the current deployment of bioelectric approaches as part of a “precision medicine” approach, but could also lead to the development of novel therapies. This line of research will be conducted under the guidance of mentors who are recognized experts in the biomarker research of schizophrenia (Anil K. Malhotra, M.D.), neuromodulation (Georgios Petrides, M.D., Marom Bikson Ph.D.), neuroimaging of ECT (Chris Abbott, M.D.) and analyzing high dimensional datasets (Jing Sui, PhD.). Concurrently, Dr Argyelan will engage in a comprehensive training program which is fully integrated with the research study in the proposal. The training plan contains three domains with corresponding goals: (1) to gain further expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials in schizophrenia, (2) to expand my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, and (3) to learn more about electrical field (EF) modeling techniques. The combination of training in clinical trials, machine learning and neuromodulation will support the planned research to provide the framework to explore and validate biomarkers of disease and treatment response. The culmination of these training activities, combined with the planned research aims under this award, will prepare Dr. Argyelan to develop into an independent translational researcher and to submit a planned R01 in personalized neuromodulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been consistently shown to be an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia, however its mechanism of action remains unknown, and there are no clinical or biological predictors to predict response. The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to examine the functional neural circuitry that underlies successful treatment with ECT, which may lead to the identification of biomarkers that will allow for more efficient use of ECT, as well as additional treatment targets for patients with refractory illness.

"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,10137860,K01AG059843,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Anxiety', 'Barbiturates', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cost Sharing', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family Physicians', 'Formularies', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part B', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universal Coverage', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,126700
"The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major arrhythmia worldwide, causing palpitations, stroke and mortality, and affecting 2-5 million Americans. Unfortunately, therapy to eliminate AF has had limited success. In our last funding cycle, we focused on localized drivers as potential AF mechanisms. Mapping of drivers has now been validated by concurrent optical mapping of human AF, and their features and have been validated by several other methods in patients. Nevertheless, ablation results for these and other proposed mechanisms for AF outside the pulmonary veins are mixed. It is unclear if this reflects difficulties of AF mapping, or different mechanisms between patients.  The project will develop a novel mechanistic framework for AF that simplifies existing indices by building on scientific consensus that organized AF is easier to treat, and disorganized AF has worse prognosis. This concept spans many existing indices and may help to reconcile them. We have 3 specific aims: (1) To define if the impact of ablation depends on the extent of organizing surrounding the ablation site; (2) To establish candidate mechanisms for organized and disorganized AF zones in individual patients with specific profiles, using machine learning applied to known cases with and without ablation success in our large registry. This comprises detailed AF maps during ablation and after Maze surgery, clinical data and outcomes. (3) To use novel clinical tools to predict whether patients will respond to PVI, other ablation or Maze surgery based on whether targeted regions control larger atrial areas and their locations.  This study will deliver immediate translational and clinical impact, and directly enable personalized medicine for AF ablation. We use detailed clinical mapping in patients, signal processing and computer modeling to develop a novel mechanistic framework and widely applicable clinical tools. We will use tools including machine learning and statistics to classify mechanisms based upon outcomes from ablation in individual patients. We will make our data and code available online. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, machine learning, biological physics and statistics. The proposal is thus highly feasible. The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem in the United States, affecting 2-5 million Americans and causing rapid heart beats, stroke, heart failure or death. In this project, the applicant will develop a novel framework to better understand human AF that builds on agreement between several concepts for the disease. The applicant will develop strategies to identify AF patients who will best respond to each of several therapies, to guide personalized therapy.",The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation,10220109,R01HL083359,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Body Surface', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Palpitations', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Right atrial structure', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,731282
"Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention Abstract Pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, more commonly known as bedsores are a huge problem affecting 2.5 million patients every year in the US and causes 60,000 deaths every year. Pressures exceeding 32 mm of Hg in the bony prominences in the back of the patient body lead to bedsores. Despite the existing low air loss mattresses, alternating pressure mattresses and the state-of-the-art air fluidized beds, bedsores prevail, and its prevention remains a huge healthcare challenge. Current hospital protocol is to turn patient every two hours. This is very disturbing and cause of pain to a resting patient who is dealing with other co-existing health conditions besides bedsores. Caregivers and nurses must turn heavy patients around, which sometimes lead to hurting their backs in the process. When not performed adequately and frequently (every 2 hours) as required, it is considered as negligence of care and causes litigation against nursing homes and hospitals causing huge financial losses to them. We propose a compliant-mechanism- based mattress that will obsolete the current clinical protocol of nurses and caregivers having to turn the patient every two hours. It will operate with minimal power, make small clicking noise when changing from one stable state to another using amount of force required to open a desk drawer. This switching of states can be further automated and can include a simple counter for documented evidence of alternating pressure to support against litigation of negligent care. In specific aim 1, machine learning using trained neural network will determine the functional requirements of the mattress (e.g., optimal amplitude and pitch for the undulation of the pressure points) by conducting a cohort pressure profile study that involves a bed that intentionally applies pressure on resting bodies. In specific aim 2, ideal topology with pitch and amplitude of undulations discovered in aim 1 will be developed using FACT and optimized using BLOT to create a prototype bi-stable compliant-mechanism-based mattress as a new approach for shifting pressure points on a patient’s body. FACT is advanced technique using freedom and constraint topologies for topology synthesis of the mattress and BLOT provides boundary layer optimization of the topology. Proposed mattress is innovative, disruptive, affordable, lightweight, does not use noisy air pumps, has no leakage issues and will eliminate the scourge of bedsores in the existing immobile and aging population. Project Narrative Numerous currently marketed alternating pressure mattresses have not received recommendations from reviewers due to poor correlation and unconvincing outcomes for bedsore prevention. Our approach of using neural network based machine learning will bring a new methodical approach to discerning the pitch and amplitude of undulations required to prevent dead pressure zones that exceed safe pressure of 32 mm of Hg on the patient’s back, which is fundamental to preventing bedsores. This will further serve as input to designing the prototype compliant-mechanism-based mattress using the freedom and constraint topologies (FACT) approach and the boundary learning optimization tool (BLOT) with end effect of developing an innovative mattress for preventing bedsores in the immobile and aging population.",Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention,10138288,R41NR019721,"['Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pressure', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Body Weight', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Extravasation', 'Fatigue', 'Freedom', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Height', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injections', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mattresses', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molds', 'Monitor', 'Negligence', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Protocols', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Recommendation', 'Rest', 'Scourge', 'Shoulder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Width', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'tool']",NINR,K MEDICAL LLC,R41,2021,251440
"Identification of Postoperative Pulmonary Complication Risk by Phenotyping Adult Surgical Patients who Underwent General Anesthesia with Mechanical Ventilation ABSTRACT Science: One in five patients who develop a postoperative pulmonary complication (PPC) dies within 30 days of surgery. PPCs are the second most frequent surgical complications and lead to increased admission to intensive care units, longer hospital length of stay, and high resource utilization. Ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) secondary to intraoperative mechanical ventilation is a risk for PPCs. Lung protective ventilation, which entails lower tidal volume, sufficient positive end expiratory pressure, optimal inspiratory time and an alveolar recruitment maneuver, has been adopted for intraoperative use to protect pulmonary parenchyma against VILI and ultimately reduce PPC incidence. However, we still do not know the optimal ventilator parameters to yield the lowest incidence of PPCs, because what is best varies from patient to patient. Personalized ventilator parameters are a potential solution to solve this problem. A retrospective study leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) is proposed to identify PPC risks by phenotyping adult surgical patients who underwent general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Examine the incidence of PPCs in the overall study population and phenotype patients based on nonmodifiable patient, surgical, and anesthesia characteristics; and examine the incidence of PPCs within each phenotypic subgroup; (2) Determine the optimal modifiable intraoperative ventilatory parameters associated with the lowest severity of PPCs within each phenotypic subgroup; and (3) Explore machine learning algorithms for predictive models of the incidence of PPCs on patient, surgical, and anesthesia characteristics as well as intraoperative ventilator parameters. The goal of this aim is to gain knowledge and training in machine learning to lay a foundation for postdoctoral training. Training: My long-term training goal is to become a leading nurse scientist in precision health using data science to improve patient outcomes following surgery, such as reducing PPCs. To achieve this goal, I have three short-term goals during my fellowship training: (1) gain knowledge and skills in research design to enhance precision health in anesthesiology to, (2) gain knowledge in advanced analytic techniques for conducting research using big data, and (3) gain an advanced understanding of pulmonary physiology and pathophysiology that influence anesthesia and patient surgical outcomes. This fellowship will allow me protected time to reach my training goals and to build a foundation for my long-term career goals. During the next twenty-six months as a trainee, I will obtain additional training in (1) research methods and design, (2) advanced statistical methods, (3) precision health, and (4) advanced pulmonary physiology and pathophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE This retrospective observational study leveraging electronic health records will improve our understanding of risks for lung complications after surgery that are associated with high mortality and morbidity. Knowledge gained from this study will inform development of interventions to reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and improve the surgical patients’ outcomes.",Identification of Postoperative Pulmonary Complication Risk by Phenotyping Adult Surgical Patients who Underwent General Anesthesia with Mechanical Ventilation,10311613,F31NR020128,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Age', 'Alveolar', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Applications Grants', 'Area Under Curve', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Body mass index', 'Characteristics', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Day Surgery', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Nurses', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Postoperative Period', 'Precision Health', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Respiratory System', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subcategory', 'Subgroup', 'Surgical complication', 'Techniques', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ventilator', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'career', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'personalized care', 'personalized strategies', 'post-doctoral training', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'provider adherence', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'sex', 'skills', 'study population', 'supplemental oxygen', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'therapy development', 'ventilation']",NINR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,37662
"Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation therapy is one of the major approaches for cancer treatment. Treatment planning, the process of designing the optimal treatment plan for each patient, is one of the most critical steps. If a treatment is poorly designed, a satisfactory outcome cannot be achieved, regardless of the quality of other treatment steps. Treatment planning in modern radiotherapy is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem defined by a set of hyperparameters. While there exists several quantifiable metrics to quantify plan quality and guide the planning process, these are simplified representations that cannot fully describe the physician’s intent. In addition, these metrics only measure plan quality from a population-based perspective, and cannot guide treatment planning to achieve the patient-specific best treatment plans. Hence, the best physician-preferred solution often sits in a gray area, only achievable by an extensive trial-and-error hyperparameter tuning process and interactions between the planner and physician. Consequently, planning time can take up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor, if the planner is inexperienced and/or under heavy time constraints. These consequences substantially deteriorate treatment outcomes, as having been clearly demonstrated in clinical studies. Recently, the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in imitation learning allows human- like decision making by observing a human expert’s actions and internally building its own decision-making system. In response to PAR-18-530, the goal of this project is to develop and translate an AI planner that mimics human experts’ behavior to generate a high quality plan. The AI planner will not replace human planners. Instead, the AI plan will be used as a starting point in the current planning process to improve plan quality and planning efficiency. The human planner’s actions on further plan improvement can feed back to the AI planner through continuous learning for its continuous evolution. We will pursue this goal using prostate cancer as the test bed through an academic-industrial partnership, jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc. The following specific aims are defined. Aim 1: Model and algorithm development. We will collect experts’ behavior data in routine treatment planning and train the AI planner. Aim 2: System validation and translation. We will integrate the AI planner into Varian Eclipse treatment planning system and validate the system in a clinically realistic setting. The innovations include the use of a state-of-the-art AI imitation learning algorithm to solve a clinically important problem, the novel technological capabilities enabled by the developed system, as well as coherent translation activities to deliver new capabilities to end users. Deliverability is ensured by extensive preliminary studies and the partnership integrating complementary expertise and resources. Clinical translation of the AI planner will bring substantial impacts to radiotherapy by providing high-quality and efficient treatment planning to benefit patients, especially those in resource-limited regions. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. Jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc, this project will develop and translate an artificial intelligence planner that is capable of efficiently generating high quality treatment plans.",Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning,10143143,R01CA254377,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Step', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'learning progression', 'model development', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'product development', 'prototype', 'response', 'routine practice', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,626797
"Early Mobilization: Operationalizing Big Data & Implementation Science to Lead Expansion to ICUs (E-MOBILE-ICU) PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 800,000 critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation every year and three quarters of the survivors suffer from persistent disability, which poses a major public health problem as critical care becomes more widely utilized and available. Although early mobilization, which engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation, is a promising evidence-based intervention that may prevent disability, less than ten percent of pa- tients ever get out of bed. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of early mobilization to critical care survivors at greatest risk for long-term disability. I hypothesize that this re- source-intensive intervention can be applied with greater precision to a subset of patients most likely to bene- fit, and that implementation science strategies can be devised to successfully drive adoption of this interven- tion beyond a clinical trial setting. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will identify the optimal critical illness phenotype for implementation of early mobilization by using cutting-edge machine learning methods; Aim 2) I will determine the effect of early mobilization on long-term functional disability to incentivize adoption of this practice; Aim 3) I will determine the barriers and facilitators of implementation of early mobilization across five institutions to identify the contextual features associated with successful implementation to inform strategies that can bridge the gap between evidence base and clinical practice. My long-term goal is to mitigate the com- plications of critical illness with clinical trials using precision-based methods to identify at-risk and yet apt-to- benefit populations paired with implementation science methodologies to illuminate how to bring these interven- tions to the bedside. To accomplish this, I have assembled an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. Vineet Arora, Matthew Churpek, and John Kress) and advisors (Drs. Shyam Prabhakaran, Donald Hedeker, Laura Damschroder, and Matthias Eikermann) who have a track record of NIH-funding and successful mentor- ship of post-doctoral candidates. I intend to build on my foundation as an accomplished clinical trialist and have formulated an in-depth career development plan to gain expertise in machine learning methods to identify differ- ential treatment effects (Churpek and Prabhakaran), longitudinal data analysis, (Arora and Hedeker), and imple- mentation science methods (Arora, Prabhakaran, and Damschroder) to craft strategies that bring complex mul- tidisciplinary interventions from clinical trials (Kress and Eikermann) to everyday ICU care. Completion of this proposal will train me to fill an unmet need defined by a recent National Academy of Medicine publication which indicated that identification of differential treatment effects must be paired with rigorous implementation to help transition evidence base to routine clinical care. Equipped with advanced statistical skills and implementation science approaches, I will be able to design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to target and implement complex multidisciplinary interventions to vulnerable populations in future R01 level applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Three-quarters of survivors of mechanical ventilation will develop persistent disability. Early mobilization engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation to prevent disability, but has poor adoption into clinical practice.

"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route.

"Preventing medication dispensing errors in pharmacy practice with interpretable machine intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular disease. The largest proportion of medical errors involve medications. Medication errors result in 3 million outpatient medical appointments, 1 million emergency department visits, and 125,000 hospital admissions each year. Astoundingly, over 4 billion prescriptions are dispensed every year in the United States alone. Although dispensing error rates are generally low at 0.06%, the sheer volume of dispensed medications translates to 2.4 million incorrectly dispensed medications each year. In the pharmacy, dispensing errors arise when pharmacists do not detect that the medication filled inside a prescription vial is different from the medication ordered on the prescription's label. These dispensing errors can result in patient harm, added strain on the healthcare system, and costly legal action against the pharmacy. Machine intelligence (MI) can be employed to assist in the verification process to help avoid dangerous and costly pharmacy dispensing errors.4–6 However for the human-MI partnership to function optimally, the MI should be capable of conveying accurate information that encourages providers to make sound cognitive decisions such that optimal trust is maintained, and temporal and cognitive demand is reduced. Imperative to this goal is to design MI from which interpretable information can be extracted, convey this information in an effective manner and calibrate user's trust in MI as either over-trust or under-trust can lead to near miss and incident errors. This proposed project will further our knowledge for designing interpretable MI outputs and inform the development of MI models that encourage pharmacy staff to make sound clinical decisions that lead to better patient outcomes while improving work-life at lower costs of care. This study develops interpretable MI methods in the context of medication images classification and designs effective MI advice and reasoning that lead to lower cognitive demand and increased trust in the MI. Our hypothesis is that interpretable MI will lead to improved work performance and more calibrated trust compared to uninterpretable M. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) design interpretable machine intelligence to double-check dispensed medication images in real-time; 2) evaluate changes in pharmacy staff trust due to the long-term use of interpretable machine intelligence; and 3) determine the effect of interpretable machine intelligence on long-term pharmacy staff work performance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular disease and the largest proportion of medical errors involve medications. These dispensing errors occur approximately 2,400,000 times every year in the United States alone and can result in patient safety issues and add unnecessarily to the already strained healthcare system.The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) design interpretable machine intelligence to double-check dispensed medication images in real-time; 2) evaluate changes in pharmacy staff trust due to the long-term use of interpretable machine intelligence; and 3) determine the effect of interpretable machine intelligence on long-term pharmacy staff work performance.",Preventing medication dispensing errors in pharmacy practice with interpretable machine intelligence,10183536,R01LM013624,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance at work', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Stream', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Vial device', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'medical appointment', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'sound', 'support tools', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,288814
"Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis PROJECT SUMMARY This overall goal of this mentored patient-oriented research career development award is to improve our understanding of pouchitis and other inflammatory conditions after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). Dr. Barnes is a motivated clinical researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), with a specific interest in the study of inflammatory bowel diseases. Over the next five years, Dr. Barnes will work with his mentorship committee to continue his progression towards his goal of independence. His mentorship committee includes experts in gastrointestinal epidemiology and comparative effectiveness (Kappelman), patient reported outcomes [(PROs) DeWalt], and precision medicine (Kosorok). Each member has an established track record of mentoring junior faculty, consistent peer-reviewed support, and high research productivity. Dr. Barnes’s career development objectives are as follows: 1) develop a new skillset in comparative effectiveness research using real-world data; 2) obtain knowledge and experience in the development of PRO assessments; 3) acquire new skills in machine learning and precision medicine principles which will allow for the incorporation of clinical and microbiota data into new risk modeling for patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA, and 4) transition to independence. To achieve his career development objectives, Dr. Barnes will participate in structured coursework, conduct mentored research, and will participate in workshops through the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, including the R-Writing Group. The research and training environment at UNC is well established. For fiscal year 2019, UNC ranked tenth among both private and public universities nationwide for National Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding to domestic institutions of higher education. The specific aims of this research project are 1) to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of specific biologic therapies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions of the pouch after IPAA; 2) to develop PRO items for evaluating quality of life and specific symptom domains among patients after IPAA. Techniques for PRO development will include identifying symptom domains relevant to patients after IPAA using qualitative research methods, selecting candidate items for IPAA-specific PROs using existing PRO instruments where appropriate, and performing cognitive interviews with patients after IPAA to ensure content validity; and 3) to demonstrate novel methods for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis using a machine learning approach. Expanding an existing prospective cohort, Dr. Barnes will utilize the stool microbiome, laboratory data and clinical variables to create signatures for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis. The combination of mentorship, didactics, and research experiences offered through this K23 proposal will allow Dr. Barnes to develop a unique skillset that will aid in his ultimate transition to independence as a clinical investigator and research scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the most common surgery for refractory ulcerative colitis and ulcerative colitis-related dysplasia, multiple complications can occur. Short and long-term complications include inflammatory conditions of the pouch such as acute and chronic pouchitis and Crohn’s-like disease of the pouch, each of which can require new medical treatments after surgery and can significantly impact the quality of life of individual patients. This mentored patient-oriented research career development project will generate evidence about the comparative effectiveness of therapies for the treatment of these inflammatory conditions of the pouch, will develop new IPAA-specific patient-reported assessments of pouch symptoms and quality of life, and will utilize precision medicine techniques including machine learning to identify patients at high-risk for developing chronic pouchitis.",Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis,10103883,K23DK127157,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colectomy', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Counseling', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Crowding', 'Curative Surgery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysplasia', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Ileal Reservoirs', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'North Carolina', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pouchitis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevention strategy', 'Privatization', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Restorative Proctocolectomy', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cognitive interview', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'effectiveness study', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'higher education', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'microbiota', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented research', 'precision medicine', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K23,2021,200052
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"A Geometric and Morphoelastic Study of Aortic Dissection Evolution Project Summary/Abstract: The natural evolution of aortic dissection is notoriously unpredictable under current methods of evaluation and management. There is an urgent need to more completely elucidate the biomechanical stability of type B aortic dissections and identify signatures in the imaging data allowing for optimal patient classification based on aortic fragility. The long-term goal is the development and validation of image-based analysis algorithms to classify aortic stability and allow a personalized risk stratification for a given patient’s aortic geometry providing the basis for optimizing clinical management. The overall objective of this proposal is to utilize modern approaches in differential geometry, continuum mechanics, and computer vision to discover and characterize high-risk geometric structures hidden within computed tomography angiography (CTA) data of fragile aortas. The central hypothesis of this application is the existence of a fundamental link between aortic shape and aortic stability as it relates to the risk of aortic dissection and fragility. The rationale for this work is development of an easily translatable geometry and mechanics-based algorithm to predict dissection stability and intervention timing by discovering a richer and more nuanced mapping of aortic shapes hidden in existing patient imaging data. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) develop a modern geometric classification for aortic shapes, 2) develop a computational model that provides the mechanism underpinning the shape evolution of aortic dissections, and 3) develop a modern successor to the traditional ‘maximum diameter’ measure of aortic dissections that integrates geometric, finite element, and physiologic factors. Utilizing a large pre-identified CTA data set of normal and dissected aortas at various stages of disease and intervention, aim 1 will use tools from computer vision to reduce aortic shape to distributions of shape index and curvedness. Aim 2 will utilize advanced morphoelastic finite element growth models to discover the biomechanical mechanism underpinning aortic shape changes in aortic dissections and validate these models on patient specific geometries over clinically relevant time periods. These novel shape and mechanical stability classifiers will be used in both linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction methods to define aortic shape sub-spaces for different clinical scenarios in aim 3. This proposal is innovative as it challenges the status quo of evaluation and treatment by deploying novel measures and techniques that analyze clinically relevant aortic geometry and the evolution of aortic shape. Every patient is taken to the operating room under the full intent of having a positive clinical outcome. The research outlined is significant because it is expected to provide surgeons and patients a more discriminative framework with which to make better informed management decisions concerning type B aortic dissections and ultimately optimize outcomes. Project Narrative: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it seeks to inform upon the potential benefits of surgical versus medical intervention for type B aortic dissection through the development of modern geometric and mechanistically based selection criteria. Upon completion there will be a richer and more nuanced understanding of aortic stability as defined from computed tomography angiography imaging, which will allow for more optimal patient selection. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH’s mission to enhance cardiovascular health and improve mortality.",A Geometric and Morphoelastic Study of Aortic Dissection Evolution,10280305,R01HL159205,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Aorta', 'Behavior', 'Biomechanics', 'Caliber', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'blood pressure variability', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'differential geometry', 'geometric structure', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'preservation', 'risk stratification', 'simulation', 'surgical risk', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,459189
"A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease We propose to develop, optimize, and conduct first in-human measurements of our Magnetic Flexible Endoscope (MFE) robotic platform that may provide a safer and more intelligent alternative to standard colonoscopy (CLS) for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at intervals less than that recommended for the general population. Thus, over the course of their lifetime, they are subjected to more frequent CLS than their non-lBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in adverse events. The main risks of CLS are related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making CLS a procedure that requires a great degree of technical skill and experience to perform safely. By using the proposed robotic platform, the endoscopist will be able to control the motion of the MFE to perform navigation, diagnosis, and therapy (i.e. biopsy, polyp removal/retrieval, injection) inside the human colon. MFE motion is achieved by magnetic coupling between an external permanent magnet (attached to a robotic arm outside the patient's body) and an internal permanent magnet (located inside the proximal head of the MFE). A small-diameter flexible tether between the head of the endoscope and the distal control module (outside the patient's body) allows for passage of commercially available therapeutic tools, insufflation, irrigation, suction/aspiration, and electrical wiring. Employing magnetic attraction at the head of the endoscope, for advancement and manipulation, permits the tether to follow passively-reducing the risk of mesenteric stretching or looping when compared to the traditional colonoscope. We will leverage our experience and extensive preliminary results to test the hypotheses that (1) intelligent robotic control and assistive autonomy in endoscopic tasks improves endoscopic performance, (2) quantifying the portion of colon lumen visualized provides valuable feedback to improve MFE operation and diagnostic yield, and (3) that the MFE is safe and successfully functions in the human colon in a manner similar to conventional CLS. The investigative team, combining engineering and clinical faculty, is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study-collectively possessing expertise in endoscopic device design, clinical CLS, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal technologies, robotics, magnetism, image processing, artificial intelligence, and translation of research-engineering developments into clinical applications. Additionally, the investigators have a long-standing history of close and fruitful collaboration including R01 EB018992. If successful, this approach will demonstrate first in-human use of the MFE that reduces potential adverse events in an at-risk population (IBD patients), is intuitive to control, and integrates intelligent guidance into colon exploration and inspection. The robotic platform we propose has the potential to provide a safer, more accessible, and potentially painless alternative to standard colonoscopy for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's disease)-a disease that impacts the lives of over three million Americans, who are at a 6-fold increased risk for post-colonoscopy adverse events when compared to their non-lBD counterparts. The platform uses magnetic actuation, intelligent closed-loop control, and integrated assistive autonomy of our diagnostic and therapeutic magnetic flexible endoscope (MFE) to facilitate intuitive endoscopist-directed motion under precise control with a novel colon-visualization-index (CVI) that provides feedback to the endoscopist with estimates of the portion of colon lumen successfully imaged to maximize the yield of exam.

"Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT There is a critical need to identify novel mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that will provide targets for new interventions. Chronic inflammation is one plausible mechanism. Using untargeted high-throughput aptamer proteomics, our recently published study has shed new light on specific, key inflammatory drivers of DKD. This was a large prospective three-cohort study that identified a novel and extremely robust circulating signature (KRIS) associated with risk of ESRD in diabetes. Our pilot study points to the data-driven connection between circulating KRIS and urinary profiles of the Complement pathway. Our hypothesis is that the Complement involvement in the kidney is a downstream effect of the systemic inflammatory processes mediating an increased DKD risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide a high-resolution view of the involvement of the Complement proteome in progressive diabetic kidney disease. Aim 1 will comprehensively evaluate the etiological role of the urinary Complement proteome in progressive DKD leading to ESRD. This evaluation will leverage a prospective two-cohort population of Joslin Kidney Study (JKS) participants with an overt DKD at baseline followed for 10 years (primary outcome – incident ESRD). Measurements will utilize an aptamer proteomic technology (SOMAscan). Aim 2 will extend generalizability of the urinary Complement proteome to earlier DKD stages. The proposed study will be conducted in participants of the Preventing Early Renal Loss (PERL) clinical trial with predominantly normal renal function at baseline followed for 3 years (primary outcome - renal slope). Aim 3 proposes to gain direct insight into the intra-renal Complement proteome by targeted and untargeted protein studies in diabetic kidney tissue (Susztaklab Biobank). This project focuses on a significant public health problem, leverages the progressiveness of the disease, employs an innovative proteomic technology and stems from strong preliminary data. Advances in this project will pinpoint missing key components of DKD etiology, thereby accelerating drug development strategies for patients with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes accounts for approximately 45% of prevalent ESRD cases in the United States, therefore new interventions to prevent or decelerate development of kidney failure are critical in order to improve the health of patients with diabetes who comprise a large sector of the US population. This study will advance our knowledge regarding the etiology of diabetic kidney complications evaluating specific components of systemic (KRIS) and local, kidney inflammation (Complement).

"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,10063814,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'detection limit', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352587
"Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP) 1. Abstract We propose to create a NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center that develops the collaborations, data systems, and methods necessary to form a state-wide Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research, aka the LEAP Center. While recent trial evidence suggests great promise for coordinated specialty care (CSC) for patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), there remain several gaps in the knowledge base for the care of psychosis in general. Now is an ideal time to address these gaps because of recent policy changes enhancing FEP care financing, practice changes in the field, and methods developed outside of mental health. To create this Center, we will start with interdisciplinary collaborations between CSC clinics in Massachusetts, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and include FEP experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. We also will leverage recent Massachusetts efforts to mandate, standardized, and support data collection on FEP care structures, delivery, and outcomes from all FEP clinics within the state. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research (CER), e.g., machine learning and g-methods, for FEP research. Accordingly, we have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2) Data systems; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will start with three foundational and complementary projects: 1) Using the state All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Project 1 will apply a population-level approach to examine which patients receive care in FEP clinics offering CSC versus elsewhere, as the number of clinics increases, then estimate the treatment effect on unfavorable clinical event rates such as hospitalizations; 2) Project 2 will review the data collected by the state from all of the FEP clinics, assess and improve data collection quality, validate measures, and integrate perspectives; and 3) Project 3 will define clusters of patients using longitudinal outcome data (i.e., begin to unpack the amount of clinical heterogeneity), predict the cluster type for individual patients, and examine the impact of CSC treatment accounting for this clinical heterogeneity. The Administrative Core and Methods Core (Prediction and CER) bind these projects together. The Center will include a group of Scientific Advisors from across North America, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines, including those that historically have had little exposure in mental health research, and Stakeholders, including policy makers, organizational decision makers, and patient and family advocates. All three groups will be deeply involved in the Center from design to dissemination. The overall goal is to create a state-wide learning health system for early psychosis. This effort to create the protocols and apply the methods necessary to convert large amounts of data into useful clinical and policy knowledge will inform other national efforts, e.g., NIMH’s EPINET. Project Narrative Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are common illnesses with serious, negative effects on patients and families; fortunately, recent studies suggest that early coordinated treatment might help mitigate some of these adverse effects. There remain many questions, however, about the disease course and treatment options, including what treatments will work best for which patients. This Center will be dedicated to addressing these questions by bringing together leading clinicians and scientists, and creating the systems needed to conduct studies to provide guidance to patients, families, and clinicians in the future.",Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP),10129429,P50MH115846,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adverse effects', 'Advocate', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Community Outreach', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education and Outreach', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'North America', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'design', 'faculty community', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'web site']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,P50,2021,1640084
"Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy Project Summary  Radiotherapy (RT) aims to deliver tumoricidal dose to clinical target volume (CTV) while sparing organs at risk (OAR), for which proton and photon beams are naturally complementary to each other: protons are generally better for OAR sparing, while photons are more robust to delivery uncertainties for CTV coverage. The hybrid proton-photon RT has a long history. However, as it generates proton and photon plans separately without fully utilizing joint proton-photon optimization during the planning stage, current hybrid RT is pseudo- hybrid and very limited in plan quality, treatment sites, and broad applicability. The key to leapfrog from pseudo-hybrid to truly-hybrid RT is new joint proton-photon optimization method that synergizes complementary proton and photon beams. The hypothesis is that truly-hybrid RT via appropriate joint proton- photon optimization will be more favorable than proton or photon-only RT, in terms of CTV coverage robustness and OAR sparing optimality.  Broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT to patients: (A) Clinical applicability: unlike pseudo-hybrid RT that is limited in plan quality and treatment sites, truly-hybrid RT may become a new paradigm for general cancer RT, owing to its superior plan quality and thus potentially clinical outcomes to proton-only or photon-only RT. (B) Clinical workflow: our truly-hybrid plans can be individually and safely delivered on existing proton and photon machines, and this effort envisions patients being treated in an integrated cancer center like ours with both proton and photon equipment, under the direction of a single physician, using shared immobilization devices, simulation procedure and structure set, and integrated treatment planning and delivery system. (C) Patient coverage: truly-hybrid RT can be made broadly available to many cancer patients through existing infrastructures in US, since (1) most hospitals with proton centers also have photon centers; (2) 76% of cancer patients live in the states with operational proton centers, while 85% are within 100-mile (2-hour-driving) distances to these proton centers; (3) cancer patients are more willing to travel for advanced treatment options.  Proposed effort: Inspired by unprecedented plan quality and broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT via our joint proton-photon optimization method, the next step is to test the hypothesis prospectively via clinical trials. However, a missing prerequisite to advance truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic is a treatment planning system (TPS) that can generate clinically-deliverable hybrid plans. To meet this urgent need, this effort will develop novel optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT, which is a radical step towards prospective clinical trials for testing the hypothesis.  Aim 1: Optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT.  Aim 2: Optimization methods for accurate and efficient MCO truly-hybrid planning.  Aim 3: Deep learning based optimization methods for efficient truly-hybrid planning. Project Narrative  This project will develop truly-”2D” proton-photon joint optimization methods for clinically-deliverable truly- hybrid RT with unprecedented superior plan quality to proton-only and photon-only RT, and first-of-its-kind TPS to bridge truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic. This hybrid TPS can facilitate prospective clinical trials of a broad spectrum of treatment sites for many patients. If succeed, truly-hybrid RT via this first-of-its-kind TPS will likely warrant improved clinical outcomes with reduced OAR toxicities, and potentially become a new paradigm for cancer RT in general, with compelling benefits in both treatment cost and clinical outcomes.",Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy,10207870,R37CA250921,"['Automobile Driving', 'Bathing', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Equipment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Immobilization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiotherapy Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Travel', 'Treatment Cost', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'clinical application', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'treatment site']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,356850
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),10105371,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,514581
"Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy PROJECT SUMMARY Injury is the most common cause of death in people younger than 46 years of age, and bleeding after injury is the most common cause of preventable death. Treatment of bleeding requires timely procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. Hospitals that specialize in treating injury have protocols, medications, devices and clinical staff available 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Injured people treated at specialized hospitals are more likely to live. However, there are far too many injured people every year than can be treated at specialized hospitals so minor injuries are cared for at hospitals not specialized in treating injuries. Severely injured people are taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries when specialized hospitals are too far away, or the emergency medical personnel underestimate how seriously injured someone is. Hospitals not specialized in treating injuries do not participate in ongoing injury clinical trials, regional data registries nor national quality improvement programs, and as a result what happens there that leads to people bleeding to death is unknown. This application's long-term objective is to improve the timeliness of treatment of bleeding after injury. The Specific Aims will be to: 1) understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in treating injuries; 2) identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment; and3) determine how to improve the timeliness of treatment. The central hypothesis is that treatment of bleeding is not standardized in hospitals not specialized in treating injuries and leads to a delay in transferring injured people to specialized hospitals. Identifying modifiable healthcare system, hospital, and patient factors can inform the design of a systematic process to quickly temporarily stabalize bleeding of injured people initially at non-specialized centers then expedite transfer to specialized hospitals by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals. This will ensure that people who are bleeding after injury are cared for at the right place at the right time. Ultimately, the right treatment at the right time will give people initially taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries the same chance at life as those taken to specialized hospitals. As a Career Development Award, the proposed training plan will include training in data science, systems engineering and design. The methods to be learned and employed will be machine learning, failure mode, effects and criticality analysis and user-centered design. The health relatedness of the project is to understand current practice management of bleeding after injury, in order to improve the timeliness of bleeding treatments to enhance the health of injured inviduals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Injury is the most common cause of death in people under 46 years old with more than 200,000 Americans dying annually. Bleeding accounts for 30% of deaths after injury, most of which are preventable if patients receive timely bleeding treatments including procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. The proposed resarch will understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in injury care, identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment, and then create an improved systematic process by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals caring for injured people.",Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy,10203288,K23HL157832,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Area', 'Bleeding time procedure', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Devices', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Practice Management', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Special Hospitals', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Work', 'blood product', 'clinical care', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'design', 'engineering design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'mortality', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'programs', 'prototype', 'severe injury', 'standardized care', 'stroke patient', 'supervised learning', 'time use', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K23,2021,190279
"Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage PROJECT SUMMARY Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke and has no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Hematoma expansion (HE), interval growth of the hematoma, is a proximate cause of worse patient outcomes and death as larger hematomas displace brain tissue; hematomas > 60 mL reliably lead to disability or death at follow-up. Preventing HE is a promising strategy to improve outcomes for patients with ICH. Our relative inability to predict HE, however, has impeded the development of effective treatment strategies for ICH, and several clinical trials have been unsuccessful. Even when HE has been reduced, our ability to detect a benefit is hampered by relatively insensitive patient outcomes. This proposal will resolve two roadblocks that prevent the development of effective treatments for ICH, the most morbid form of stroke. Three comprehensive stroke centers (two from the Northwestern Medicine system in metropolitan Chicago, IL, and the University of Texas at Houston) will partner to prospectively enroll patients with ICH, measure hemostasis, measure HE, and record patient outcomes with state of the art assessments, including the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and NIH Toolbox. First, we will determine the mechanisms that lead to HE in acute ICH, broadly grouped into platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Each can be specifically measured and has specific treatments to improve it. For example, reduced platelet activity due to aspirin can be reliably improved with desmopressin, delayed activation of coagulation may be related to hypomagnesemia, and accelerated fibrinolysis may be reduced with tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid. Each will be examined for predicting HE; if multiple pathways are found, we will determine which are most important with machine learning. Once the most important mechanisms of hemostasis for HE are determined, we will explore if specific therapies improve platelet activity. It is possible that specific treatments for specific deficits in hemostasis will be more likely to reduce HE than single therapies applied to ICH patients generally (e.g., Factor VII). Once hemostatic mechanisms of HE are determine, we will determine the effect of HE on patient outcomes such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS, a global ordinal scale), PROMIS, and NIH Toolbox. This will be crucial to plan for future clinical trials intended to improve patient outcomes through correcting abnormal hemostasis in acute ICH. Results will apply broadly to other bleeding conditions (e.g., neurotrauma). PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke. Hematoma expansion is a proximate cause of worse outcome after ICH, yet our ability to predict HE is limited. This proposal will determine how platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis predict HE, and how HE, in turn, affect patient outcomes.","Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage",10133760,R01NS110779,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Aminocaproic Acids', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents', 'Aspirin', 'Blood Coagulation Factor VII', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Desmopressin', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Factor VIIa', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hypomagnesemia', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Texas', 'Thrombelastography', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain tissue', 'clopidogrel', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metropolitan', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'stroke trials', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,609173
"A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Advances in acute care have decreased short-term mortality of sepsis, resulting in an increasing number of survivors who experience significant morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections account for 60% of hospital readmissions after sepsis and are an important cause of long-term mortality. Identifying sepsis survivors at risk for infections and understanding predisposing factors are therefore important first steps to develop personalized interventions to improve long-term outcomes. The overall research goal is to develop innovative targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes after sepsis. This proposal focuses on identifying subgroups of sepsis survivors (phenotypes) at high risk for infection-related hospital readmissions and deaths. It is hypothesized that the combination of host factors, disease characteristics, and interventions prior to and during sepsis will identify distinct phenotypes that are captured by clinical data. These clinical phenotypes likely have distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms (e.g., immunosuppression), predispose to different outcomes (e.g., recurrent infections), and patients with the same phenotype may respond similarly to targeted interventions such as immunomodulation. In Aim 1, three nationally representative datasets of sepsis survivors will be assembled and analyzed by machine learning techniques to identify valid clinical sepsis phenotypes. In Aim 2, phenotypes at high-risk for infection-related readmissions and deaths at 6 months will be identified, and underlying biomarker profiles for these phenotypes analyzed. In Aim 3, these high-risk phenotypes will be used to conceptualize and simulate an adaptive platform trial designed to test the efficacy of three different immunomodulatory drugs. An adaptive trial design was chosen, because it can test multiple interventions simultaneously and reduces the chances of exposing patients to ineffective or harmful interventions. The research plan is augmented by expert mentoring and rigorous didactic training. Together, this will provide the candidate with essential career development skills in the science of precision medicine, including machine learning methodologies, Bayesian statistics, and innovate clinical trial design. This proposal has potentially groundbreaking implications for the future treatment of sepsis survivors, because it deviates from the current “one-size fits all” approach and attempts to create the framework for personalized interventions. This framework sets the stage for future independent investigator (RO1) applications evaluating personalized treatments in adaptive clinical trials, and will uniquely position the candidate as a future leader in the field of long-term outcomes after critical illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is important for public health because sepsis is a life-threatening infection that affects 30 million people worldwide each year. Long-term outcomes for patients who survive a hospital admission for sepsis are poor, and many patients develop new disabilities or worsening of preexisting health conditions. This proposal supports the NIH’s mission to enhance health and reduce illness and disability by trying to identify interventions for sepsis survivors at highest risk for poor outcomes.",A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors,10120705,K23GM132688,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interleukin-7', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Sepsis', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'acute care', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'recurrent infection', 'response', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'trial design']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2021,185808
