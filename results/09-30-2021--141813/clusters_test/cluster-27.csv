"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,10112245,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,312660
"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that predominately affects the lung and may affect other organs. We propose to construct a model to predict sarcoidosis progression or resolution by identifying microbial and immune interactions. We postulate that these models will be helpful in designing therapeutic options.",Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis,10087953,R01HL138628,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Genes', 'Granuloma', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Sarcoidosis', 'Severity of illness', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'anergy', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'host microbiome', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'lung microbiome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pulmonary function', 'resilience', 'response', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,912947
"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us. Understanding these interactions is a critical step in re-engineering the microbiome to improve human health.","Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions",10063870,R21EB027396,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Candida albicans', 'Carbon', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral candidiasis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'fungus', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'large datasets', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'network models', 'open source', 'oral pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'phenotypic data', 'preference', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,178370
"Intelligently predicting viral spillover risks from bats and other wild mammals PROJECT SUMMARY The transmission or ‘spillover’ of wildlife viruses to humans is a critical threat to global health, with outbreaks of viral pathogens like filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses all originating in wild mammals. A key outstanding question is whether specific taxonomic groups, such as bats, warrant extra surveillance as ‘special reservoirs’ of viruses that are potentially pathogenic to humans. However, existing host-virus datasets are not sufficiently resolved to predict fine-grain risk for species or genera. An effective response must therefore address two core aims: (i) synthesizing knowledge regarding virus-to-mammal interactions; and (ii) using that knowledgebase to robustly predict future spillover events (i.e., zoonotic risk). To enable robust analysis and reusability of public datasets of NIAID’s Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC; especially NCBI Virus and Virus Pathogen Resources, ViPR), the project will develop Host-Virus Data Intelligence to address three main problems for data reuse: confidence of the taxonomic assignments of mammals and viruses in observations; confidence in the evidence for proposed mammal-virus interactions; and connecting all the relevant data in published texts that are hidden from existing databases. The project team will construct a novel bioinformatic pipeline that will digitally connect taxonomic knowledge, use it to search dark data to find evidence of potential host-virus interactions, and then link it together using metadata layers (‘data about the data’) to form a more expansive host-virus knowledge graph than previously feasible. The project’s computational approach leverages information extraction methods in natural language processing as well as novel applications of artificial intelligence methods such as probabilistic inductive logic programming. A key anticipated outcome is to expand the dataset of host-virus interactions by 3-fold compared to comprehensive existing datasets. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a new generation of work reusing host-virus interaction data to test previously inaccessible hypotheses about how species’ traits impact viral spillover to humans. Shifting the paradigm to graph-based analyses, compared to purely taxonomic representations of host-virus interactions, will allow researchers to directly investigate the impact of ecosystem structure and human encroachment upon viral loads. Determining whether all mammals have equal risk of viral spillover, or whether some groups have higher taxon-specific zoonotic risk (e.g., horseshoe bats, murid rodents), is critical information for public health workers and epidemiologists. More definitive risk quantification will also help researchers identify which ecophysiological adaptations predispose certain groups to tolerating more viruses, which may in turn lead to clinical treatments by modeling the immune responses of wild mammals. Filling the identified gaps in host-virus knowledge is therefore essential to aid the progress of zoonotic disease research in the wake of COVID-19. PROJECT NARRATIVE Synthesizing scientific data about mammal-to-virus interactions is essential to predicting the risk of future events like the COVID-19 pandemic. The project overcomes major obstacles to full and accurate reuse of existing mammal-virus data by applying computational methods for unifying relevant but disconnected data from published sources. Anticipated results will triple available knowledge, opening the door for asking whether some mammals carry more viruses than others and why with unprecedented levels of precision.",Intelligently predicting viral spillover risks from bats and other wild mammals,10289637,R21AI164268,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Epidemiologist', 'Event', 'FAIR principles', 'Feces', 'Filovirus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immune response', 'Immunological Models', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Mammals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Muridae', 'Names', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paramyxovirus', 'Pathogenicity', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Services', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral reservoir', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'bioinformatics resource', 'data reuse', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge graph', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'prevent', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'surveillance study', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'virus host interaction']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2021,244519
"Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data Big data is now ubiquitous in every field of modern scientific research. Many contemporary applications, such as the recent national microbiome initiative (NMI), greatly demand highly flexible statistical machine learning methods that can produce both interpretable and reproducible results. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify crucial causal factors that are responsible for the response from a large number of available covariates, which can be statistically formulated as the false discovery rate (FDR) control in general high-dimensional nonlinear models. Despite the enormous applications of shotgun metagenomic studies, most existing investigations concentrate on the study of bacterial organisms. However, viruses and virus-host interactions play important roles in controlling the functions of the microbial communities. In addition, viruses have been shown to be associated with complex diseases. Yet, investigations into the roles of viruses in human diseases are significantly underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches to deal with highly complex big data and the applications of these approaches to solve fundamental and important biological and biomedical problems. There are four interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will theoretically investigate the power of the recently proposed model-free knockoffs (MFK) procedure, which has been theoretically justified to control FDR in arbitrary models and arbitrary dimensions. We will also theoretically justify the robustness of MFK with respect to the misspecification of covariate distribution. These studies will lay the foundations for our developments in other aims. In Aim 2, we will develop deep learning approaches to predict viral contigs with higher accuracy, integrate our new algorithm with MFK to achieve FDR control for virus motif discovery, and investigate the power and robustness of our new procedure. In Aim 3, we will take into account the virus-host motif interactions and adapt our algorithms and theories in Aim 2 for predicting virus-host infectious interaction status. In Aim 4, we will apply the developed methods from the first three aims to analyze the shotgun metagenomics data sets in ExperimentHub to identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with several diseases at some target FDR level. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for metagenomics studies under a variety of environments. Big data is ubiquitous in biological research. Identifying causal factors associated with complex diseases or traits from big data is highly important and challenging. New statistical and computational tools will be developed to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) for molecular sequence data based on the novel model-free knockoffs framework. They will be used to detect sequence motifs for viruses and motif-pairs for virus-host interactions, and to analyze multiple metagenomics data sets related to complex diseases.",Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data,10159277,R01GM131407,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archaea', 'Attention', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Mathematics', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Non-linear Models', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Shotguns', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'model design', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'power analysis', 'response', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'theories', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction', 'virus identification']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,276700
"Carbohydrate enzyme gene clusters in human gut microbiome PROJECT SUMMARY Carbohydrate enzyme gene clusters in human gut microbiome Hippocrates said ~2,400 years ago: “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food”. It is now well known that this is largely due to the “diet-microbiota-host” interactions that happen in the human gut. In particular, microbial degradation of carbohydrates can produce a variety of metabolites, which have a profound impact on human health. As a bioinformatics researcher in the Nebraska Food for Health Center, the long-term interests of the PI include: (i) develop specialized computational tools for better functional annotation of food-digesting microbial genomes and metagenomes, and (ii) characterize enzymes and other genetic elements that connect microbes, diets, and human health. The objective of this R01 project is to develop a suite of bioinformatics tools for functional annotation of carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) and CAZyme gene clusters (CGCs) in human gut microbiome. The PI has over 10 years of experience in CAZyme bioinformatics tool development, and maintains a well-recognized CAZyme annotation database and web server called dbCAN (http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2). This project aims to further dbCAN development to address fundamental personalized nutrition questions: (i) is a gut microbe able to utilize a specific type of glycan? (ii) can a person carrying certain gut microbes respond to an individualized diet (e.g., prebiotics: dietary compounds that are beneficial to human health)? To address these questions, new CAZyme annotation tools must have the ability to predict the carbohydrate substrates of CAZymes. Recent research has found that different CAZyme encoding genes are often co-localized with each other and with other genes (e.g., those encoding sugar transporters, regulators, and signaling proteins) in bacterial genomes to form CGCs (also known as polysaccharide utilization loci or PULs). Thus, the foundation of the new tool development is that the gene membership (or functional domain composition) of a CGC can be used to predict its carbohydrate substrates (e.g., xylans, pectins, glucans, etc.). The innovation is that machine learning approaches will be used to analyze a large number of experimentally characterized PULs curated from literature, and the extracted sequence features will be used to build effective classifiers to predict and classify CGCs in new genomes/metagenomes. The expected outcome will be novel and user-friendly open source computer programs, databases, and web servers that allow automated CGCs identification and substrate predictions. The significance is that the new tools will facilitate the experimental characterization of more PULs and their carbohydrate substrates in human gut microbiome (also in other carbohydrate rich environments). Therefore, this project will contribute computational solutions to the research of personalized nutrition, e.g., analyze a person's gut microbiome to predict if this person can respond to diets containing certain prebiotic glycans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Human gut microbes primarily feed on carbohydrate substrates derived from diet and host, and produce important metabolites that significantly influence host physiology and health. The functional annotation of the carbohydrate metabolic enzyme repertoire of gut microbes is poorly defined for most bacterial phyla, resulting in gaps in understanding of how microbial communities utilize these carbohydrates to influence human health. Creating new bioinformatics tools for predicting carbohydrate utilization will contribute to the arising microbiome-based personalized nutrition practice and aid in the development of therapeutic options to prevent/treat human metabolic disorders.",Carbohydrate enzyme gene clusters in human gut microbiome,10099567,R01GM140370,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacteroidetes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Carbohydrates', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Family', 'Firmicutes', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glucans', 'Glycosides', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mannans', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Microbe', 'Nebraska', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Pectins', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Polysaccharides', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Signaling Protein', 'Starch', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'Xylans', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computer program', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dietary', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'host microbiota', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'metagenome', 'metatranscriptome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'microbiome sequencing', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'open source', 'prebiotics', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sugar', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user-friendly', 'web server']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,R01,2021,302120
"Manifold representations and active learning for 21 st century biology Project Summary With the rise of high-throughput sequencing and multiplexed biotechnologies enabling single-cell multi-omics and massively parallel CRISPR experiments, the biomedical community is generating a monumental amount of data. These data promise to reveal new biology and drive personal and precision medicine. However, the sheer volume of genomic data is overwhelming current computational resources, requiring prohibitively high compute time, memory usage, and storage. My lab has been at the forefront of solving big data challenges in genomics, designing novel algorithms that enable efficient and secure analyses that were previously computationally infeasible, and that reveal novel structural, cellular, and systems biology. Drawing upon our expertise in developing scalable and insightful algorithms for analyzing genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, we aim to tackle two key data-driven challenges facing the biological community: 1) efficient, accurate, and robust characterization of tissues at the single-cell level, and 2) translating high-throughput datasets into biological discoveries via machine learning-based prediction. To solve the first challenge, we will leverage our discovery that seemingly high-dimensional sequencing data often lies on low-dimensional manifolds that capture the underlying biological state of interest. We will design algorithms that generate these compact, meaningful manifold representations of single-cell omics datasets. This will enable a number of key applications including characterizing co-expression and gene-modules that define healthy and pathologic cell states; integrating multi-modal single-cell omics datasets to more richly characterize cellular diversity; and investigating the mechanisms underlying transcriptomic diversity across tissues and developmental states. To solve the second challenge, we will take a two-pronged approach. First, we will design novel machine learning frameworks that provide a measure of confidence when predicting in unfamiliar biological states, enabling prediction that is robust to “out-of-distribution” (unobserved) examples. We will then work with our experimental collaborators and CROs to rapidly perform experimental validation of model-based predictions. Finally, we will return the experimental results to the model to further improve performance. This will enable an “active learning” feedback loop to efficiently explore a complex biological space for outcomes of interest. We will use this uncertainty-powered active learning approach to explore several pressing biological concerns such as the identification of small molecule compounds with enzymatic or whole-cell growth inhibitory properties, efficient design of spatial- transcriptomic experiments, computationally guided CRISPR perturbation experiments, and identification of functional non-coding mutations. This project will result in 1) numerous software tools with wide utility that efficiently analyze massive biological datasets and guide complex experimentation, and 2) reveal biological insights, especially into biomolecular interactions and cellular heterogeneity. Project Narrative The rise of high-throughput genomic profiling of individual cells and efficient, targeted manipulation of cellular phenotypes (including CRISPR-based genetic perturbations) promise to revolutionize our understanding of cellular biology and disease. However, realizing this revolution will require new computing paradigms that can integrate and analyze these massive datasets and suggest new biological hypotheses and experimental designs. Here we develop novel computational algorithms and software for tackling these challenges to characterize cellular diversity and improve our ability to manipulate cells to understand and treat disease.",Manifold representations and active learning for 21 st century biology,10207091,R35GM141861,"['Active Learning', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Secure', 'Software Tools', 'Spatial Design', 'State Interests', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cell growth', 'computing resources', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2021,478341
