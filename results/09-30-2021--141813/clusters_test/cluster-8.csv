"Human Face Representation in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks The human visual system can recognize a familiar face across wide variations of viewpoint, illumination, expression, and appearance. This remarkable computational feat is accomplished by large-­scale networks of neurons. We will test a face space theory of the representations that emerge at the top layer of deep learning convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as a model of human visual representations of faces. Computer-based face recognition has improved in recent years due to DCNNs and the easy availability of labeled training data (faces and identities) from the web. Inspired by the primate visual system, DCNNs are feed­forward artificial neural networks that can map images of faces into representations that support recognition over widely variable images. Although the calculations executed by the simulated neurons are simple, enormous numbers of computations are used to convert an image into a representation. The end result of this processing is a highly compact representation of a face that retains image detail in an invariant, identity­-specific face code. This code is fundamentally different than any representation of faces considered in vision science. This theory we test combines key components of previous face space models (similarity, learning history) with new features (imaging conditions, personal face history) in a unitary space that represents both identity and facial appearance across variable images. We will test whether this model can account for human recognition of familiar faces, which is highly robust to image variability (pose, illumination, expression). The model will also be applied to understanding long standing difficulties humans (and machines) have with faces of other races. We aim to bridge critical gaps in our knowledge of how DCNNs work, linking psychological, neural, and computational perspectives. A fundamentally new theory of face representation will alter the questions we ask about face representations in all three fields. A new focus on understanding how we (or neural networks) “perceive” a single familiar identity in widely variable images will give rise to a search for representations that gracefully merge the properties of faces with the real-­world image conditions in which they are experienced. This project presents a unique opportunity to study, manipulate, and learn from these representations, and to apply the findings to broader questions about high-­level vision from neural and perceptual perspectives. Human recognition of familiar faces is highly robust to image variability (pose, illumination, expression)—a skill that is likely due to the quality and quantity of experience we have with the faces of people we know well. Deep convolutional neural networks are modeled after the primate visual system and have made impressive gains recently on the problem of robust face recognition. Understanding the visual nature of the face “feature” codes that emerge in these networks can give insight into long-standing questions about how the human visual system can, but does not always, represent a face in a way that generalizes across images that vary widely.",Human Face Representation in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,10129967,R01EY029692,"['Affect', 'Appearance', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Familiarity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Published Comment', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Space Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feedforward neural network', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural network', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'representation theory', 'skills', 'theories', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,R01,2021,361998
"Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication Project Summary/Abstract: Processing acoustic communication signals is among the most difficult yet vital abilities of the auditory system. These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure has profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, and for improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders, such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. Non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans reveal the loci of language-related processing but do not answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. Thus, circuit-level neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing remain poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language. This proposal investigates neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing abilities shared between songbirds and humans. In Aim 1, we test the cellular-level predictions of a powerful modelling framework, called predictive coding, proposed as a general computational mechanism to support the learned recognition of complex temporally patterned signals at multiple timescales. We combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods with multi-electrode electrophysiology, to test explicit models for natural stimulus representation, prediction, and error coding in single cortical neurons and neural populations. One aspect of auditory perception integral to speech is the discretization of the signal into learned categorically perceived sounds (phonemes). In Aim 2, we use the predictive coding framework to investigate the learned categorical perception of natural auditory categories in populations of cortical neurons. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent phonemes can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Aim2 also examines how categorical neural representations are affected by temporal context. In addition to which phonemes occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Songbirds also attend to the statistical regularities in their vocal communication signals. In Aim 3, we focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication,10160864,R01DC018055,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'learned behavior', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,335661
"Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition Project Summary The septohippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in multiple cognitive Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains, including memory, attention, anxiety, and sensorimotor processing. This circuit is comprised primarily of the medial septal nucleus (MSN), hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Pharmacological and genetic models targeting glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction within this circuit result in memory deficits, difficulty with attention, and social interaction impairments. Therefore, we are studying the relationship between MSN-mPFC- hippocampal oscillatory activity in NMDA receptor hypofunction models to better create treatments for disrupted theta and gamma oscillations which are altered in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Recent evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be one such promising treatment modality for circuit disorders. This NIMH K08 Career Development Award will provide the necessary foundation for Darrin J. Lee, MD, PhD to pursue the development of novel DBS techniques for septohippocampal circuit disorders. The project and training plan are rooted in the electrophysiological and molecular underpinnings of NMDA receptor hypofunction, while concomitantly enabling the candidate to collaborate with and learn from his mentors and consultants. This program will enable him to supplement his current skillsets in areas where he has identified gaps in his knowledge base, including relevant research methodology, study design, machine learning, and structural connectivity. The proposed research will focus on 1) characterizing neural oscillations within the septohippocampal circuit in two complementary models of NMDA receptor hypofunction (pharmacological: chronic MK-801 administration and genetic: parvalbumin interneuron-selective NR1 knockout); 2) evaluating the cognitive effects of DBS in these rodent models, and 3) evaluating the relationship between electrophysiological biomarkers and behavior using machine learning. The interpretation of data from this research will improve understanding of specific electrophysiological aspects of impaired brain function in septohippocampal circuit disorders and serve as a catalyst for a research program centered on neuromodulation for these disorders. Moreover, data collected, skills procured, and collaborations developed will enable Dr. Lee to seek R01 funding and obtain career independence. Taken together, the data collected, and training developed will ultimately facilitate development of an investigator with unique skills in service of ameliorating suffering caused by septohippocampal circuit disorders. Project Narrative Current treatments for psychiatric disorders with deficits in cognitive and emotional Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains have limited efficacy, necessitating more effective treatment strategies. Disorders with NMDA receptor hypofunction lead to septohippocampal circuit dysfunction and circuit-specific cognitive dysfunction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) alters focal and diffuse networks and has recently been posited as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. This project aims to evaluate the the role of electrophysiological networks involved in NMDA receptor hypofunction and utilize DBS to improve cognitive behavior.",Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition,10161859,K08MH121757,"['Acute', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Glutamates', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'MK801', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Medial Septal Nucleus', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'N-methyl-D-glutamate', 'NR1 gene', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pacemakers', 'Parvalbumins', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'basal forebrain', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'effective therapy', 'functional restoration', 'genetic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prepulse inhibition', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'septohippocampal', 'skills', 'targeted biomarker', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K08,2021,196326
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,10348398,R01NS107357,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Experiments', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analog', 'base', 'design', 'direct application', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human imaging', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'memory recognition', 'memory retrieval', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'recruit', 'success', 'theories']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,79818
"Neural markers of impending task performance PROJECT ABSTRACT The neural mechanisms underlying successful cognitive performance are not well understood. In this R03 project, we will thoroughly investigate the ability to predict behavioral improvements through changes in shared underlying neural mechanisms. Identifying neural metrics that predict individual performance gains will ensure more reliable behavioral outcomes across diverse populations with varying cognitive capabilities and age ranges. Additionally, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying successful cognition will allow for rescuing of lost cognitive abilities and prophylaxis of cognitive decline in aging and other vulnerable populations such as in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We recently identified several signals in the electroencephalogram (EEG) that correlated with cognitive performance improvements following and intervention with cognitive training and/or noninvasive neurostimulation. Specifically, frontal midline power in the theta band (4-8 Hz) correlates with improved divided attention ability and transfer to improved sustained attention ability in older adults (Anguera et al., 2013), and frontoparietal connectivity in the theta band is linked to improved attention (Anguera et al., 2013) and working memory (Jones et al., 2017). In addition to band- limited theta, we found that cross-frequency coupling between frontal theta oscillations and temporo-parietal gamma (>30 Hz) activity tracked individual performance gains in working memory following intervention with training and neurostimulation (Jones et al., 2020). These findings suggest that theta oscillations, as measured by power, connectivity, and cross-frequency coupling in task-relevant regions, underlie individual differences in cognitive performance. Indeed, the application of noninvasive neurostimulation confirmed the critical role of theta oscillations in divided attention by showing that direct entrainment of frontal theta oscillations further enhanced performance (Hsu et al., 2017, 2018). The proposed research will determine the mechanisms by which theta oscillations, assessed at baseline, predict subsequent cognitive performance outcomes in aging and vulnerable populations. Critically, we identified preliminary evidence that an individual's intrinsic peak theta frequency predicted the efficacy of theta entrainment with neurostimulation on divided attention ability. This important preliminary result demonstrates that a nuanced approach to tailoring an intervention to the individual is feasible. Here, our analyses seek to predict subsequent performance during divided attention prior to intervention (Aim 1) and before trial onset in a range of cognitive tasks (Aim 2). We will conduct comprehensive regularized multiple regression and deep learning analyses on 13 existing EEG datasets, several of which share the same divided attention task, yet vary in participant demographics, including age and cognitive capability (healthy older and younger adults, multi-domain amnestic MCI patients), to develop a predictive model for an individually-tailored cognitive intervention. The results will inform future research that seeks to maximize the reliability of intervention protocols across demographics at any age or cognitive capability. PROJECT NARRATIVE This grant proposal seeks to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms responsible for behavioral improvement through novel secondary analyses on a variety of cognitive tasks (divided attention, working memory, perceptual discrimination) and participants that range from healthy younger adults, healthy older adults, and multi-domain amnestic mild cognitive impairment. The goal will be to fit identified oscillatory neural metrics within a model that can predict cognitive performance through the use of advanced EEG and deep learning analyses. This predictive model will be of public health importance as the outcome will allow for tailoring of cognitive prophylaxis, rehabilitation, and interventions in healthy, at-risk, and in clinical populations.",Neural markers of impending task performance,10218883,R03AG065966,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Ensure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'age related', 'aging population', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive training', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'demographics', 'executive function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'secondary analysis', 'sustained attention', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted treatment', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2021,161500
"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation Project Summary/Abstract One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign—yet annoying—examples of ‘normal’ forgetting, it is also a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have emphasized the critical role of pattern separation in reducing memory interference. Pattern separation involves coding similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for confusion is thereby minimized. While there is general agreement that pattern separation is implemented by the hippocampus—and that pattern separation is important for reducing memory interference—there remain several fundamental gaps in our understanding of how, when, and why pattern separation occurs. In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity—that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation—to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. Project Narrative A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may only represent an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia—groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate— memory confusion and interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting, including in younger and older adults, and will lead to fundamental new insight into how the brain resolves interference between similar memories.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,10123856,R01NS089729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory Disorders', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'age related', 'clinically significant', 'data mining', 'dentate gyrus', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forgetting', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'insight', 'motivated behavior', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,485965
"Molecular characterization of extracellular vesicles for the spread of misfolded tau protein Neurofibrillary tangles, composed of intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (tau), are by far the most correlated pathology for clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs, such as exosomes and microvesicles), transfer pathological tau between cells as vehicles, propagating tau pathology. It is urgently important to find the molecular basis of brain-derived EVs, which may critically regulate EV uptake by neurons and aggregation of tau protein in EVs and/or recipient neurons. We have recently established the method for isolating EVs from human brain samples and successfully performed their proteomic profiling. We found that selective molecules from the EV proteomics datasets were able to differentiate human AD-EV from healthy control (CTRL)-EV with 88% accuracy by machine learning analysis, confirming pathogenic character of AD-EV molecules. Furthermore, our exciting preliminary data have shown that AD-EV have significantly higher tau seeding activity compared to CTRL-EV by FRET sensor tau seeding assay with subsets of EV molecules showing significant association with tau seeding activity. This proposed project will fortify these preliminary results and find the converging or specific mechanisms among tauopathies for mediating tau aggregation and its seeding via EV uptake through proteomics and biological examination of brain-derived EV samples. To meet this challenge, we assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have a strong record of accomplishments in biologic (Ikezu), proteomic (Emili) and bioengineering and bioinformatic analysis (Issador). In Aim1, we will examine EV samples from 240 new brain specimens (40 AD, 40 CTE, 40 LBD, 40 PSP, 40 CBD and 40 CTRL) for precision mass-spectrometry-based proteomics and tau-interactomes, and analyze those datasets by the machine learning approach. Aim 2 will examine the efficiency of tau propagation using tau fibrils, oligomers and EVs isolated from the same donors of the 5 different tauopathies and control cases in vitro and in vivo using FRET-based tau seeding assay and EV uptake by primary cultured mouse cortical neurons in vitro. EV-associated tau will be further characterized by the biochemical and microscopy-based analysis for their conformational and posttranslational changes. We will evaluate the difference in tau propagation after the intracranial injection of the tau seeds from different tauopathy brains using our recently established mouse models. Aim3 will identify candidate molecules most likely involved in EV uptake and tau seeding activity by bioinformatic analysis of the proteome dataset (Aim 1) and biological datasets (Aim 2). We will then test the functional roles of the identified molecules on EV uptake, tau seeding activities and neuronal firing activities in vitro. The candidate molecules will be specifically targeted by gene silencing or antagonists for their therapeutic potential to halt tau propagation in vitro and in vivo. Successful identification of responsible molecules for tau propagation will serve as a foundation for understanding EV-mediated disease progression. We propose to achieve highly comprehensive characterization of the protein composition of extracellular vesicles in human brain tissues, and determine their emerging roles on enhancing neuronal uptake of vesicle associated tau and spread of tau pathology in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. The candidate molecules will be specifically targeted by specific antagonistic reagents for their therapeutic potential for halting tau propagation in vivo. These studies will lead to a better understanding of vesicle-mediated disease spread mechanism in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathy.",Molecular characterization of extracellular vesicles for the spread of misfolded tau protein,10130196,R01AG067763,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Atomic Force Microscopy', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biosensor', 'Brain', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cells', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Endocytosis', 'Energy Transfer', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'MAPT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Target', 'Mus', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'Tauopathies', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transfection', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vesicle', 'abnormally phosphorylated tau', 'aged', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'case control', 'chronic traumatic encephalopathy', 'corticobasal degeneration', 'differential expression', 'disorder control', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'gray matter', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'microvesicles', 'mouse model', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'multidisciplinary', 'non-demented', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'transmission process', 'uptake']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2021,625498
"CRCNS:  Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals. Strategic planning is commonly impaired in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression, but their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood.

"Contextual Representation of Tactile Information in Mouse Primary Somatosensory Cortex Career Plan and Environment of Career Development: Dr. Emanuel is a joint postdoctoral fellow in the laboratories of Drs. David Ginty and Chris Harvey who is dedicated to a career as an academic researcher. Drs. Emanuel, Ginty, and Harvey have developed a 12-point career development plan that will enable Dr. Emanuel's transition to an independent research position. This plan incorporates resources available at Harvard Medical School, including formal and informal training from the community within the Department of Neurobiology and the broader Harvard Medical School community. Formal training includes attendance at seminars on professional development and responsible conduct of research as well as engaging the wider scientific community with publication of manuscripts describing Dr. Emanuel's work and presentations at international meetings. Overall, this plan will optimally prepare Dr. Emanuel for the transition to an independent career. Research Plan: The goal of this project is to determine how the representation of complex features in primary somatosensory cortex are produced by cortical and subcortical neural circuitry and how these representations are adapted for the behavior of the animal. Specifically, the experiments in this proposal will use mouse genetic approaches and in vivo electrophysiology to address the neural underpinnings of speed, direction, and orientation tuning in primary somatosensory cortex (Aim 1). Combining in vivo electrophysiology with genetic manipulations and recording from primary somatosensory cortex will determine the extent to which these cortical representations are necessary for and adapt to performance of tactile behaviors (Aim 2). Finally, combining in vivo electrophysiology in freely moving animals with modern computer vision for monitoring behavior and the force applied to the skin will determine how neurons in primary somatosensory cortex are engaged during natural movements and environmental interactions (Aim 3). In all, these experiments will yield insight into the fundamental processes underlying sensory processing in the central nervous system. Completion of the experiments in this proposal will bolster our knowledge about how sensory systems represent the environment and the extent to which these representations are tailored to the behavioral needs of animals. The insights gained should, in the long term, be applicable to the development of machine-brain interfaces and treatments for sensory and nervous system disorders. Such development would reduce illness and disability, thereby enhancing quality of life.",Contextual Representation of Tactile Information in Mouse Primary Somatosensory Cortex,10105749,K99NS119739,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Felis catus', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mechanoreceptors', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Work', 'awake', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'career development', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genetic approach', 'genetic manipulation', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'mechanical device', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'mouse genetics', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'sensory system', 'somatosensory']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,99104
"Shared and specific mechanisms of auditory and visual category learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability to learn new perceptual categories enables some of the most complex human behaviors, from speech perception to visual object recognition. Current understanding of the mechanisms involved in perceptual category learning relies on the fundamental assumption that the processes underlying such learning are shared across the senses. However, the vast majority of this work has focused on the visual modality. As a consequence, the research regarding how humans learn to group complex auditory information into categories has relied greatly on conclusions from the research in the visual domain without testing this critical assumption. However, recent evidence from the attention literature suggests that even seemingly domain-general cognitive processes, such as working memory, are accomplished via sensory-biased regions in frontal cortex. The current investigation will directly compare the computational and neural mechanisms supporting auditory and visual category learning by training the same individuals on categories in both modalities while in an fMRI scanner. Aim #1 of this investigation will identify the shared and sensory-biased circuits supporting feedback processing during auditory and visual category learning. If the neural circuits supporting perceptual category learning are shared across the modalities, it is expected that similar regions will be recruited to a similar extent during feedback processing. If instead, the neural circuits are distinct for particular modalities, it is expected that sensory-biased regions will emerge as supporting category learning for auditory and visual modalities. Aim #2 will utilize advanced machine learning techniques (multivariate pattern classification and representational similarity analyses) to characterize the emergence of category-level neural representations over the course of learning. Aim #3 will identify the functional and structural connectivity of the circuits as they contribute to perceptual category learning. The proposed research will directly test the fundamental assumption about the nature of this complex problem that affects everyday behaviors. This research has the potential to impact understanding of cases where modality- specific learning abilities might be impaired, such as phonetic learning and language-related impairments in dyslexia, autism, and specific language impairment. The proposed research will provide the training foundation to support the PI’s long-term objective of developing theories of perceptual category learning that are constrained by neurobiology and behavior and will specify the behavioral, computational, and neural mechanisms of such learning. This project presents the opportunity to directly test a critical assumption underlying understanding of perceptual category learning. The proposed research will take place in an exceptional training environment and the PI will be mentored by a team of knowledgeable and accomplished scientists. The research will provide the PI with training in functional magnetic resonance experiment design and analysis which will prepare her well for a career as an independent scientist in computational cognitive neuroscience. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will contribute to fundamental knowledge about how seemingly general-purpose cognitive systems may demonstrate modality specificity. The goal of this investigation is to characterize the differences in cognitive processing during category learning when the information comes from the auditory or visual modalities. The findings from this work may inform mechanistic approaches to understanding modality- specific deficits in language-based disorders, such as dyslexia, autism, and specific language impairment.",Shared and specific mechanisms of auditory and visual category learning,10197776,F32DC018979,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Environment', 'Esters', 'Feedback', 'Finches', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hobbies', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mentors', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Work', 'auditory stimulus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'career', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'object recognition', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'theories', 'visual learning']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2021,65994
"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Using in vivo recordings of electrical activity across key brain regions, we will uncover how the brain encodes reward and punishment at the network level.

"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,10226122,R01MH120158,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotional functioning', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'millisecond', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'preclinical study', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,706855
"Cracking the Olfactory Code Project Summary (Overall: Cracking the Olfactory Code)  Sensation drives perception, which informs decisions and actions. Olfaction is the main sense used by most animals to interact with the environment. However, olfaction remains shrouded in mystery — we do not know which molecular odorant features matter to the olfactory system and which do not, how information about these features is recombined to create holistic odor representations within the brain, or how those representations relate to perception. As a consequence, we lack an empirical understanding of the core transformations taking place at each stage of olfactory processing, which ultimately lead to perception and behavior. In addition, we lack a clear theoretical framework for understanding how a stimulus space that is both discrete and high-dimensional yields a perceptual space that is continuous and low dimensional. Because the olfactory system is “shallow” — meaning that within two synapses information about complete odor objects is abstracted and generalized — understanding this specific circuit will also afford general insight both into architecturally-related allocortical brain regions critical to behavior (e.g., cerebellum, hippocampus), and into cortical centers that play a key role in integrating diverse sources of information (e.g., prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex). Here we propose to reveal the computational logic of olfaction by collecting the first system-wide dataset of neural and perceptual responses to a large, principled set of odorants, and by applying a unified statistical and theoretical approach to its interpretation. This project will convene research groups with expertise that spans neurobiology, and will leverage recent technical advances in molecular genetics, neural imaging, electrophysiology, opto- and chemogenetics, human psychophysics, and machine learning to interrogate all levels (from peripheral receptors to cortex to perceptual and behavioral output) of the olfactory system. Taken together, these experiments will establish a reference dataset that reveals the key transformations performed by the olfactory system, test a key unifying theory for olfaction, and create a community-wide resource that will prompt new theory and experiment. This work will also have wide-ranging implications for our general understanding of how sensory information is organized in the brain to facilitate adaptive action. Project Narrative (Overall) The brain builds rich internal representations of the external world in order to support perception and behavior. Here we take advantage of the architectural simplicity of the mammalian olfactory system — and an interdisciplinary team whose expertise ranges from molecular genetics and optogenetic to machine learning and human psychophysics — to characterize how odor information is sequentially transformed by neural circuits to generate meaningful perception. This work will both address longstanding mysteries about the inner workings of the olfactory system, and reveal general principles that govern how the brain organizes and processes information.",Cracking the Olfactory Code,10200162,U19NS112953,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Frequencies', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sense Organs', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic manipulation', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'new technology', 'novel', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory receptor', 'olfactory stimulus', 'optogenetics', 'piriform cortex', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'stimulus processing', 'theories', 'working group']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U19,2021,2774000
"Rapid Evaluation of Neuronal Activity in the Intact Whole Brain at Single Cell Resolution Project Summary  Here we seek to develop a “Neuronal Activity Quantitative Diagnostic” platform and reagent kits to disseminate accessible products for measuring recent neural activity across the entire mouse brain to the neuroscience community. Previously we have shown that the activity-dependent immediate-early gene protein products Npas4 and cFos can be clearly detected, imaged, and quantified using developmental versions of our platform tools. Immediate early genes are genes that are activated transiently and rapidly in response to a wide variety of cellular stimuli. The three overlapping aims to be investigated in this Phase II project are:  1) Demonstration of the fidelity of our assay for our customers. To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our neuronal activity assay with another well-known assay for activity, we will perform two photon calcium fluorescence imaging in the primary visual cortex of mice presented with repeated visual stimuli. We will clear and stain the brains for cFos and Npas4 and demonstrate the fidelity of these markers for detecting recently active neurons.  2) Develop and beta test robust versions of our software tools useable by researchers with no specialized coding or statistics knowledge. We will develop Stitchy and BrainSnap into robust, user-friendly software products that remove the current analysis bottleneck for neuroscientists interested in whole-brain imaging. Stitchy will be an improved browser-based version of our internal software that simplifies and speeds the process of stitching together light sheet microscope images. BrainSnap software will integrate our high-performance 3TK- Quant framework for machine learning-enabled quantification and our statistical framework for whole-brain anatomics, 3TK-Stats, in a browser-based interface. We have recruited end users who will test this software in a head-to-head comparison with our in-house testing.  3) Develop and test a brain clearing and staining kit for neuronal activity. To help researchers produce high quality cleared brains stained with neuronal activity markers, we will generate Neuronal Activity clearing and staining reagents kits for cFos and Npas4. These will be tested by collaborators in head-to-head comparisons with our in-house procedures on brains prepared in parallel.

"Tracking the dynamics of how schemas scaffold recall Project Summary Every new experience in our life takes place within the context of familiar environments and situations. However, most research on memory has focused on the artificial memorization of word lists, symbols or pictures; these studies do not meaningfully address how structured prior knowledge about the world (e.g., in the form of a familiar spatial map, or knowledge of how restaurant meals unfold over time) can scaffold new learning. In the proposed studies, I aim to precisely characterize how and where prior knowledge and new information are represented, how they get linked at encoding, and how they interact at recall to allow memories to be retrieved. In the first proposed study of my F99 phase, I test the hypothesis that hippocampal engagement at event boundaries during learning binds new information (i.e. objects) to the scaffold of existing knowledge (i.e. knowledge of a familiar location), and that hippocampal activation during recall mediates the successful retrieval of the bound object from the location in which it was stored. I also test the hypothesis that distinctive representations of spatial locations in the brain will reduce interference between objects stored in those locations. There is a potential downside to using prior knowledge as a scaffold: When there is too much information attached to one part of the scaffold, old and new memories will interfere with each other. How, then, could someone prioritize the retrieval of new memories over older (now-irrelevant) memories that were linked to the scaffold? Recent research on intentional forgetting suggests a solution to this limitation. Specifically, in my second proposed study, I test the hypothesis (supported by neurophysiological evidence, prior neuroimaging results, and computational models) that previously encoded memories can be weakened by moderately activating their neural representation, thereby “cleaning” the scaffold and reducing interference. In the K00 phase, I will extend my research to identify pathologies in how clinical populations use prior knowledge to interpret and remember their experiences, using tools from computational psychiatry; I also plan to design new technological tools to address these issues. Overall, the proposed project makes use of naturalistic and ecologically valid stimuli (in the form of continuous stimuli and immersive virtual reality) paired with advanced machine learning tools applied to brain imaging data, to study the fundamental nature of how new and old information are linked to allow learning. In the long-term, the findings from this project regarding how prior knowledge can be optimally leveraged to support new learning will lead to the development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals make better use of prior knowledge to support new learning, as well as remedies for groups where deficiencies in prior knowledge prevent them from learning properly. Project Narrative In my dissertation, I will use newly-developed machine learning techniques to study how the brain uses prior knowledge (about the spatial structure of an environment, or how certain types of events unfold in time) to scaffold new learning. By precisely characterizing how this scaffolding process works, my research will help to identify ways in which prior knowledge can be more optimally leveraged to support learning. This will lead to the development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals make better use of intact prior knowledge to support new learning, as well as remedies for groups where deficiencies in prior knowledge prevent them from learning properly.",Tracking the dynamics of how schemas scaffold recall,10156352,F99NS120644,"['Address', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Restaurants', 'Retrieval', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'field study', 'forgetting', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'phase 1 testing', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual world']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2021,47036
"Cortical computations underlying binocular motion integration PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Neuroscience is highly specialized—even visual submodalities such as motion, depth, form and color processing are often studied in isolation. One disadvantage of this isolation is that results from each subfield are not brought together to constrain common underlying neural circuitry. Yet, to understand the cortical computations that support vision, it is important to unify our fragmentary models that capture isolated insights across visual submodalities so that all relevant experimental and theoretical efforts can benefit from the most powerful and robust models that can be achieved. This proposal aims to take the first concrete step in that direction by unifying models of direction selectivity, binocular disparity selectivity and 3D motion selectivity (also known as motion-in-depth) to reveal circuits and understand computations from V1 to area MT. Motion in 3D inherently bridges visual submodalities, necessitating the integration of motion and binocular processing, and we are motivated by two recent paradigm-breaking physiological studies that have shown that area MT has a robust representation of 3D motion. In Aim 1, we will create the first unified model and understanding of the relationship between pattern and 3D motion in MT. In Aim 2, we will construct the first unified model of motion and disparity processing in MT. In Aim 3, we will develop a large-scale biologically plausible model of these selectivities that represents realistic response distributions across an MT population. Having a population output that is complete enough to represent widely-used visual stimuli will amplify our ability to link to population read-out theories and to link to results from psychophysical studies of visual perception. Key elements of our approach are (1) an iterative loop between modeling and electrophysiological experiments; (2) building a set of shared models, stimuli, data and analysis tools in a cloud-based system that unifies efforts across labs, creating opportunities for deep collaboration between labs that specialize in relevant submodalities, and encouraging all interested scientists to contribute and benefit; (3) using model-driven experiments to answer open, inter-related questions that involve motion and binocular processing, including motion opponency, spatial integration, binocular integration and the timely problem of how 3D motion is represented in area MT; (4) unifying insights from filter-based models and conceptual, i.e., non-image- computable, models to generate the first large-scale spiking hierarchical circuits that predict and explain how correlated signals and noise are transformed across multiple cortical stages to carry out essential visual computations; and (5) carrying out novel simultaneous recordings across visual areas. This research also has potential long-term benefits in medicine and technology. It will build fundamental knowledge about functional cortical circuitry that someday may be useful for interpreting dysfunctions of the cortex or for helping biomedical engineers construct devices to interface to the brain. Insights gained from the visual cortex may also help to advance computer vision technology. NARRATIVE The processing of visual motion and depth information is essential for a wide variety of important human abilities, including navigating through the world, avoiding collisions, catching and grabbing objects and interpreting complex scenes. To understand how neurons in the visual cortex transform and represent the information that underlies these abilities, we aim to initiate the development of a more complete, biologically constrained and openly available computer model of motion and depth processing that will be used to guide, and to interpret and incorporate results from, primate visual neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments. Gaining an understanding of the normal function of cortical neural circuitry is an important step in building the fundamental knowledge that someday may help to improve the ability to assess dysfunctions of the cortex and may help bioengineers create devices that interface to cortical circuitry to treat disorders and overcome disabilities.",Cortical computations underlying binocular motion integration,10188534,R01EY027023,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Production', 'Psychophysics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Motion', 'Visual Perception', 'area MT', 'base', 'cloud based', 'color processing', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fitness', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatial integration', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual neuroscience', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,387514
"Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sustained attention – the continuous allocation of cognitive resources to respond to infrequent but behaviorally relevant stimuli – is impaired in many psychiatric disorders and represents an important aspect of cognitive control. Sustained attention requires top-down control and engagement with the external world, which is linked to both frontoparietal and thalamic controlling signals on primary sensor cortices. Despite the extensive behavioral characterization of sustained attention in animal models using the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), very little is known about the oscillatory interaction between the dorsal attention network and thalamo-cortical dynamics and its potential as a stimulation target for enhancing sustained attention. The objective of this project is to dissect the causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic stimulation. I will focus on three regions in the visual thalamo-cortical network: higher-order visual thalamus (lateral aspect of lateral posterior nucleus, LPl), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and primary visual cortex (V1). I will test the central hypothesis that LPl-cortical theta (4-7 Hz) functional connectivity causally coordinates PPC-V1 functional connectivity to facilitate sustained attention. The rationale of this work is that the proposed temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetic perturbations will directly test the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention. Accordingly, the two specific aims are: (1) Delineate the functional role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention, (2) Determine the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetics. This work is significant because it will causally test a convergent model in which higher-order visual thalamus coordinates the parietal top-down control signals onto visual cortex that is crucial for developing circuit- based therapies to enhance sustained attention. The work is innovative due to its integration of closed-loop optogenetics circuit interrogation, multisite electrophysiology, freely-moving sustained attention task, and machine-learning tools for the investigation of the causal role of oscillatory synchronization. The overall positive impact of the proposed study is to provide a more comprehensive map of how the higher-order visual thalamus interacts with the frontoparietal control signal to modulate V1, and thus mediates sustained attention, a transdiagnostic cognitive function that shows impairment in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The implication of this study is that it may reveal a general mechanism underlying the interaction between two higher-order processing structures signaling to lower sensory cortices during cognitive processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sustained attention enables us to focus our cognitive resources on an activity for a prolonged period of time, and when impaired causes profound deficits in both cognition and behavior. Sustained attention is modulated by the thalamo-cortical rhythms. The research generated in this proposal will investigate (1) what oscillatory feature in the higher-order thalamo-cortical circuit is crucial for sustained attention, and (2) how the temporally- precise enhancing or disrupting of a thalamo-cortical oscillatory feature alters the functional connectivity in the circuit and behavioral outcomes mediated by sustained attention.",Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention,10199754,F31MH118799,"['Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Ferrets', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Impulsivity', 'Investigation', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lateral posterior nucleus of thalamus', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area striata', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'functional disability', 'innovation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'sustained attention', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2021,40048
"Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants. Project Summary Functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) has revealed two major principles of the functional organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in human adults. First, some regions of VTC respond selectively to a specific category of stimuli, such as the fusiform face area (FFA) which responds more to faces than to any other stimulus category. The second principle of organization is that different categories of stimuli have systematically distinct patterns of response across the entire VTC. How do these two key aspects of VTC functional organization in adults arise in development? The goal of my research program is to discover if these organizing principles are present in the infant brain (Aims 1 and 2) and design computational models to test different theories of cortical development (Aim 3). The dissertation work in this proposal will provide invaluable data toward the goal of refining theories of cortical development. In addition to innovations that enhance the quality of awake infant fMRI data, Aim 1 provides the first evidence that like adults, infants have face-selective responses in the FFA, scene-selective responses in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), and body-selective responses in the extrastriate body area (EBA). Aim 2 directly follows this up by asking if infants have systematically distinct patterns of response across higher- level visual areas that are similar to those found in the adult brain. The F99 phase of this proposal will provide training to optimize machine learning (ML) techniques that can withstand the unique challenges of infant fMRI data – specifically unbalanced and missing data. The F99 phase will be conducted at MIT, an intellectual environment with access to leaders in the fields of ML, cognitive neuroscience, and computational neuroscience. Finally, Aim 3 of this proposal is to build computational models designed to test current theories of cortical development. The K00 phase of this proposal will provide training on the design and implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) models as well as training on the best methods to test ANN models using infant fMRI data. Research for the K00 phase will provide a new mentorship experience with an established investigator in computational neuroscience and will take place at an institution with a thriving intellectual environment that has access to an MRI scanner and the computational resources necessary to build a variety of ANN models. In summary, the objective of the proposed research is to determine if the principles of functional organization in the adult brain are present in infants. Insights from this proposal will advance and refine theories of cortical development and have the potential to be applicable to other domains such audition and language. Further, by combining my predoctoral training in awake infant fMRI with my proposed postdoctoral training in computational modeling, the proposed research will enable me to become an independent investigator and leader in the field of computational developmental neuroscience. Project Narrative The last 20 years of cognitive neuroscience has revealed the functional architecture of the human brain with an exquisite degree of detail yet has left wide-open the question of what guides the precise development, organization, and structure of the human mind. This proposal outlines a plan to unify developmental cognitive neuroscience and computational cognitive neuroscience to uncover the starting state of the human visual system and how it develops. The proposed research stands to not only inform and refine theories of cortical development and inform our understanding of neurodevelopmental differences, but also has the potential to begin to unravel one of the most intriguing questions available to humanity: what are the origins of the human mind?",Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants.,10319402,F99NS124175,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Social Desirability', 'Social support', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'awake', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computing resources', 'design', 'experience', 'extrastriate', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning community', 'model design', 'object recognition', 'organizational structure', 'post-doctoral training', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'response', 'social cognition', 'social engagement', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'tool', 'vision development']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F99,2021,47036
"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",10134450,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'confocal imaging', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'detection method', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2021,527956
"Neural mechanisms of risk for irritability across the transition to adolescence PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Irritability—exaggerated anger in response to non-reward—is among the most common psychiatric complaints. Because irritability in late childhood and adolescence predicts mental disorders across the lifespan, identifying the neural mechanisms involved in irritability across the transition to adolescence is paramount to intervene before youth irritability problems harden into entrenched psychiatric disorders in later adolescence and adulthood. Irritability is linked with abnormalities in reward processing, which may lead to greater frustration when rewards are not received. Such reward processing vulnerabilities may be ameliorated by better inhibitory control, which normatively increases with maturation. However, the interplay between reward processing and inhibitory control in irritability is unknown. Investigating longitudinal changes in neural circuitry is important because reward- and inhibition-related neural networks undergo substantial change from childhood through adolescence. Our overall goal is to identify reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize changes in irritability over the transition to adolescence. To this end, the proposal leverages data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, a large, national longitudinal sample of preadolescents assessed annually (N=~8,312 with usable datasets; baseline age=9-10; 1-Year Follow-Up [1-YRFU] age=10-11; 2-YRFU age=11-12). At baseline and 2-YRFU, youth complete monetary incentive delay and stop-signal tasks during fMRI acquisition that assess neural responses to reward and inhibitory control, respectively. Across all waves, youth irritability and co-occurring psychopathology are assessed using clinical interviews and parent- and youth-report measures, and multiple behavioral and parent- and youth-reported measures of youth reward processing and inhibitory control are collected. Our central hypothesis is that preadolescents with both reward- and inhibition-related neural deficits are more likely to show persistently high or increasing irritability across the transition to adolescence, whereas preadolescents with reward-related brain deficits, but better inhibition, will demonstrate decreases in irritability. Specific aims are to identify (1) separate and (2) interactive contributions of reward- and inhibition-related neural function to concurrent irritability; to identify (3a) preadolescent reward- and inhibition-related neural predictors and (3b) developmental changes in reward and inhibition neural mechanisms, of irritability trajectories and future psychopathology across the transition to adolescence; and to explore (4) the moderating role of developmental-biological-contextual factors (sex, puberty, race/ethnicity, SES, familial characteristics) on these brain-behavior relationships. This proposal will advance the field by revealing the neural circuitry of irritability. Innovative aspects include focusing on a key age range (transition to adolescence) to prevent adult disorders, multiple time point imaging, formulation of a novel and comprehensive reward-based model of irritability, machine learning methodology, and replication analyses. Our project is significant because it will be a catalyst for a research program to inform precision medicine for irritability.

"Prefrontal contributions to contextual representation Project Abstract/Summary This application describes a 3-year training plan that will enable me, a cognitive neuroscientist with prior training in electroencephalography (EEG), to conduct research on contextual memory representation using neuroimaging (fMRI) and computational modeling. EEG is useful for examining the timing properties of neural activity, but cannot localize activity to specific regions of the brain. In this proposal, I will receive training on a high-spatial resolution neuroimaging technique (fMRI), which will allow me to develop theories of neural function that are constrained by both space and time. I will also build on my prior degree in applied statistics and receive additional training in computational neuroscience, which will enable me to develop computational theories at the macro-circuit level. I will be supervised by Dr. Sharon Thompson-Schill, an expert fMRI experimentalist and theorist of lateral prefrontal cortex function, who has extensive experience researching the context-dependent nature of semantic memory. I will be co-supervised by Dr. Anna Schapiro, an expert on statistical learning and computational modeling of the brain. I propose to examine how prefrontal cortex (PFC) represents statistical dependencies among sequentially presented visual and auditory input. I will examine how the temporal extent and level of abstraction of sequential representations changes across ventral PFC. This will connect findings from several literatures, ranging from decision-making to emotion processing and language comprehension, within a single unifying framework. In addition, I will explore whether ‘deep’ or ‘shallow’ recurrent neural networks better capture the sensitivity profile of ventral PFC, informing the question of whether the brain conducts ‘deep’ learning. In Aim 1, I will conduct behavioral piloting and collect data for two neuroimaging experiments on hierarchical sequential processing. I will have participants learn the statistical properties of hierarchically organized sequences of abstract visual (Aim 1a&b) and auditory (Aim 1b) images. I then test for neural sensitivity to statistical learning at each hierarchical level using pattern similarity analysis, comparing the neural response to the sequences before and after learning. In Aim 2, I will conduct computational modeling of the neuroimaging data in Aim 1, with held out data to ensure robustness and reproducibility. I compare the neuroimaging data to internal model representations derived from single-layer (‘shallow’) and multi-layer (‘deep’) recurrent neural networks trained on the same sequences as the humans in Aim 1. By modeling the neural representation of context itself, the current proposal will help fill a critical gap in our understanding of how the brain predicts upcoming sensory input, enabling rapid processing of the world around us. It will also inform our understanding of several psychiatric disorders that involve prefrontal cortex disfunction and disturbances of contextual processing, such as schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. Project Narrative As we navigate the world we are bombarded by a flood of sensations that our brain must rapidly make sense of, and understanding the context we are in as it relates to the likelihood of upcoming experiences is important for enhancing the speed and accuracy of this process. This proposal examines how sensory context is represented in the brain, by having people learn statistical regularities in artificial sequences of images and syllables and modeling neural activity in prefrontal cortex as they are exposed to different sensory “contexts” using fMRI. Through computational modeling of prefrontal cortex, we can enhance our understanding of the function of a brain region implicated in many neuropsychological disorders where the perception of context is distorted or disrupted, including anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.",Prefrontal contributions to contextual representation,10144850,F32MH123002,"['Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Esthesia', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Floods', 'Fractals', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grain', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'interest', 'language comprehension', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sequence learning', 'social', 'sound', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F32,2021,66390
"Model-based credit assignment Abstract How the brain forms, tunes, and uses predictive models that specify the causal links between stimuli in the environment, our choices, and their outcomes is a fundamental question in Psychology and Neuroscience. A great deal of progress has been made identifying the neural computations theorized to form and update predictive models. This research has played a central role in the rise of computational psychiatry, but its relevance to clinical disorders has been limited in part by the use of relatively simple learning/choice paradigms that capture only a narrow subset of the structural complexity of real-world learning.  In order to make sound predictions in a complex world, the brain needs to attribute good and bad outcomes to their most likely causes, a problem known as “credit assignment”. There is little understanding of how outcomes are attributed to their most likely causes in structured real-world environments. Most real-world learning occurs in complex and structured environments, such as hierarchical systems (e.g. seasonal events, social hierarchies, contextual rules, etc.). Recent evidence suggests that humans can use an understanding of the environment’s causal structure to attribute outcomes to their most likely causes (which I call “model-based credit assignment)”, rather than simply attributing them to the most recently experienced stimuli and choices that were made (which I call “model-free” credit assignment), as standard models have proposed.  The purpose of the present proposal is to develop the first neural model of model-based credit assignment. We hypothesize that the brain reinstates the cause when a reinforcement outcome is experienced to associate with the outcome. In other words, so that “fire-together/wire-together” plasticity mechanisms can link a choice with an outcome, the choice representation and the outcome representation must both be active at the same time even though the causal choice or event may have actually occurred some time beforehand.  To test this and other predictions, we will integrate mathematical descriptions of learning and decision making with “representational” analysis methods that allow inferences to be made about the information represented in brain areas, applied to fMRI and scalp EEG data. fMRI will reveal how neural learning signals update neural representations of likely causes during learning, while EEG will reveal the timing of the hypothesized reinstatement. These experiments will set the stage to apply the insights gained to investigate how the brain attributes outcomes to more abstract “latent” causes in hierarchically structured environments prevalent in the real world. The proposed project will thus move this general program of research strategy toward learning tasks that better reflect the complexity and structure in many real-world learning/choice situations important for both typical and atypical individuals. Project Narrative Research into how the brain forms and tunes predictive models that specify the causal relationships between stimuli in the environment, our actions, and their outcomes has made dramatic strides by identifying key learning computations in the brain in both typical and atypical individuals. However, the application of this research to clinical disorders has been limited by use of relatively simple learning/choice tasks that do not capture much of the structural complexity of real-world learning. The present project aims to develop the first neural model specifying how reinforcement outcomes are attributed to their most likely causes in such structured environments.",Model-based credit assignment,10083230,R56MH119116,"['Address', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Clams', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Restaurants', 'Role', 'Scallop', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Service delivery model', 'Shellfish', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Weight', 'base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'insight', 'neural model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'shellfish hypersensitivity', 'sound', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2021,384992
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,10132411,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'rabies viral tracing', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,403711
"Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Working memory (WM), the cognitive entity that allows for temporary storage and manipulation of informa- tion, is crucial for much of what gives life subjective meaning, and enables an individual to participate in larger society. This includes following a conversation, finding a supermarket item, planning, driving, learning new skills—most anything that requires holding in mind information from long-term memory and/or sensory input for use requires WM. As a result, WM dysfunction has devastating effects, and regrettably, millions—individuals with schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, dementia, and more—experience varying degrees of WM impairment, which is almost totally treatment resistant. Given its role in neurocognitive health and disease, understanding the mechanisms of WM is imperative. Correspondingly, this project will explore in depth the circuit basis for WM.  The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be a primary orchestrator of WM, processing input from other brain regions for WM instantiation. In spatial working memory (SWM), a WM subdomain regularly studied across species, interactions of the PFC with the ventral hippocampus and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) are considered essential, with PFC-MD interactions undergirding neural maintenance of WM content and subsequent action selection. Notably, the PFC is quite heterogeneous, being composed of layers that differ both in their cellular composition and in their connectivity. Yet the possibility that these laminar subregions might uniquely contribute to the multifaceted ways in which the PFC empowers WM is only now being explored: recent studies suggest that superficial PFC layers support WM content maintenance, while deep PFC layers support post-maintenance action selection. This proposal expands upon these studies by using novel technology to explore cellular-resolution laminar representations in WM.  Specifically, this proposal examines what WM content is encoded in the activity of individual cells vs. popula- tions in the different PFC layers (Aim 1) and assesses the dependence of these laminar WM representations on input from the MD (Aim 2). To do so, calcium imaging will be performed through microendoscopes in mice genetically and surgically specified to express calcium indicators in particular PFC layers. These mice will perform a trial-based delayed nonmatch to sample WM task in a custom-built, automated 8-armed radial maze, and for Aim 2 will have MD input to the PFC optogenetically silenced during behavior and imaging (to simulate the MD-PFC hypoconnectivity regularly observed in those with WM deficits). Finally, for rigorous mapping of behavior to neural activity, novel machine learning behavioral classification paradigms will be used.  WM provides the cognitive building blocks for the very fabric of quotidian life—sustaining social relationships, maintaining a job, living independently, learning new things and more. Given such complexity, detailed interrogation of WM circuit mechanisms is required. Accordingly, this proposal uses emerging technologies to explore circuit mechanisms of both WM function and dysfunction, advancing pursuits of therapeutic innovation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Working memory, the cognitive entity through which information can be temporarily held in mind for processing, is fundamental to many essential human activities, from holding a conversation, to walking home from the bus stop, to introspecting. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been known to undergird working memory, with information maintenance empowered by input from the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), but how the different PFC layers support this complex and versatile capability remains largely unclear. This proposal will assess the neural representations in PFC layers during spatial working memory, and how they depend on MD input, to better establish circuit mechanisms for working memory instantiation, to the end of moving us closer to eventual therapies for the millions affected by working memory impairment.",Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze,10198670,F31MH124323,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Critical Thinking', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medial', 'Medial Dorsal Nucleus', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Mind', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opsin', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Supermarket', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Textiles', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'arm', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cellular imaging', 'cost', 'empowered', 'experience', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'long term memory', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'microendoscope', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'self-directed learning', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'social relationships', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2021,46036
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need. Deep understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes in health and disease will translate into identifying novel therapeutic avenues for treatment of brain disorders.",Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools,10102648,R01MH110504,"['Address', 'Astrocytes', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Peer Review', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'complex data', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2021,488894
"Actin-mediated regulation of organelle dynamics in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Project Summary  Organelle dynamics profoundly affect the physiology of the cell and are regulated by interactions with the cytoskeleton. Alterations in organelle dynamics (i.e., inter-organelle and cytoskeletal contacts, fission, and mobility) are associated with a variety of human diseases, particularly neuropathies. Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is the most commonly inherited neuropathy and is caused by mutations in at least eighty different genes. Although the mutations that cause CMT are often in genes linked to altered organelle dynamics, questions remain regarding the pathogenic mechanism. Mitochondrial fission is mediated by the polymerization of actin at ER-mitochondria contact sites via the ER-anchored, actin polymerizing protein INF2. Dominant activating mutations in INF2 cause increased mitochondrial fission and excessive actin accumulation on mitochondria, which reduces mitochondrial mobility. Similar mutations in INF2 also cause CMT. Preliminary data show that 1) actin accumulates at fission sites of other organelles including endosomes, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and the Golgi, and 2) that CMT mutations in INF2 cause a reduction in endosome and lysosome mobility. This leads to the central hypothesis of this proposal: there is a conserved molecular mechanism regulating organelle fission and mobility mediated by actin cytoskeletal proteins at ER-organelle contact sites. Furthermore, it is proposed that reduction in organelle mobility specifically affects peripheral neurons due to the extreme length of these cells and hence may be a general pathogenic feature of CMT. The Specific Aims of this project are as follows: Aim 1 focuses on the role of INF2 in mitochondrial, endosomal, and lysosomal fission and how these processes are altered by mutations in INF2 that cause CMT. These studies will be carried out in primary human fibroblasts via live-cell imaging, including the use of a novel, innovative probe that specifically labels ER-associated actin. Experiments to assess organelle functions and to directly implicate actin polymerization in the phenotypes observed will also be performed. Aim 2 will be carried out in cultured primary mouse neurons in order to properly assess how alterations in organelle dynamics and mobility affect neuronal health. Deep learning-based image restoration will be used to achieve high spatiotemporal resolution imaging of organelle mobility. Aim 3 will include organelle and neuronal health assays in the context of disease-relevant models of CMT. Specifically, neurons derived from CMT patient fibroblasts and neurons from mice injected with AAVs directing expression of CMT- mutant INF2, MFN2, or RAB7A will be analyzed. Completion of these aims will provide mechanistic insight into the role of actin in organelle fission and mobility, how these processes are coupled, and test the novel hypothesis that CMT involves global disruption of mobility of multiple organelles. This will further our understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of CMT and perhaps other neurodegenerative disorders. The project will also enhance my scientific training by providing me with invaluable training in neurobiology and neurodegeneration, designing novel imaging probes, advanced imaging techniques, stem-cell based reprogramming, and mouse models. Project Narrative Alterations in organelles (e.g. mitochondria) are linked to various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Charcot- Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease; however, our understanding of how organelle dynamics are regulated is still not complete. While actin has a known role in ER-mediated mitochondrial fission through the activities of the actin- regulatory protein INF2, our preliminary results suggest a common mechanism at play in other organelles. This proposal focuses on ER- and actin-mediated organelle fission, how this process impacts organelle motility, and the consequences of CMT mutations that disrupt these processes in nerve cells in culture and in mice.",Actin-mediated regulation of organelle dynamics in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,10142253,F32GM137580,"['Actins', 'Affect', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Dependovirus', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Endosomes', 'Environment', 'Fibroblasts', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Label', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lysosomes', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Organelles', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'depolymerization', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'hereditary neuropathy', 'human disease', 'imaging approach', 'imaging probe', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'live cell imaging', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'nanobodies', 'nerve stem cell', 'novel', 'peroxisome', 'polymerization', 'programs', 'restoration', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell technology', 'stem cells']",NIGMS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,F32,2021,66390
"Uncovering the neurophysiology of motivation in ParkinsonÃÂs disease with implanted adaptive brain stimulation TITLE: UNCOVERING THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGY OF MOTIVATION IN PARKINSON’S DISEASE WITH IMPLANTED ADAPTIVE BRAIN STIMULATION PROJECT SUMMARY Behavioral symptoms such as apathy and impulsivity represent a prevalent, highly-disabling feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and many other neurological conditions, for which treatments are currently very limited. The long-term goal of this award is to understand the neurocircuitry of motivation in order to develop precise and personalized therapies for motor and non-motor symptoms in neurological disorders. The overall objective is to establish the neural structures and signals that underpin motivation in PD. My central hypothesis is that the human motivation system comprises two functionally distinct frontal cortex - basal ganglia (FC- BG) circuits that drive behavior: 1) the prefrontal - basal ganglia circuit evaluates rewards and operates in the theta (3-7Hz) frequency range and 2) the premotor - basal ganglia circuit evaluates action costs, and is mediated by beta (13-30Hz) frequency signals, with both modulated by dopamine. Therefore, the rationale of the project is that understanding the neural structures and signals of the FC-BG reward circuit is critical for the development of effective stimulation therapies for behavioral symptoms in PD. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two Specific Aims: Aim 1) Identify the neurophysiological signatures of reward cost-benefit evaluation in PD. Patients with chronically implanted, sensing-enabled brain stimulators will perform reward cost-benefit evaluation tasks with simultaneous FC-BG recordings, on and off dopamine medication. Additionally, patients will trigger recordings of neural signals at home, with paired self-reports of apathy and impulsivity. Aim 2) Evaluate the causal relationship of frontal cortex-basal ganglia structures & signals to behavior. Spatio-temporally targeted brain stimulation will be delivered to the FC-BG network during reward cost-benefit evaluation to test the causal role of these structures and signals to motivated behavior. The research is innovative because it uses a) chronic invasive brain recordings, in patients, during behavioral tasks that index motivation, b) recordings at home to determine within-subject reproducibility and link to naturalistic motivational states and c) causal interventions to demonstrate mechanistic relationships. It is significant because determining an accurate understanding of the neurocircuitry of reward will enable the future development of precise, spatio-temporally targeted adaptive brain stimulation for apathy and impulsivity in PD, a major unmet need. As such, Dr. Little has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring group led by Prof. Philip Starr and supported by advisors Profs. Edward Chang, Wendy Mendes and Joshua Berke to develop a comprehensive structured training plan involving 1) cognitive-affective neuroscience 2) electrocorticography 3) machine learning and 4) trial design and statistics. This award will propel Dr. Little towards independence and expertise in the investigation of the neurophysiology, and treatment, of motor and non-motor neurological symptoms. It will also provide the foundation for a future R01 application investigating the relationship between clinical apathy, impulsivity and neurophysiology in a wide cohort of neurological patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Personalized, adaptive, brain stimulation has the potential to benefit disabling behavioral symptoms such as apathy and impulsivity across a wide range of neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, but is currently limited by a lack of understanding of how the brain assesses rewards to drive actions. The goal of this project is to determine how rewards are evaluated across the frontal cortex - basal ganglia circuits and to evaluate the mechanistic role of the structures and signals of this network in Parkinson’s disease. This foundational understanding will direct future stimulation therapies to reduce the burden of apathy and impulsivity in Parkinson’s disease and other neurological disorders in a precise and principled manner.",Uncovering the neurophysiology of motivation in ParkinsonÃÂs disease with implanted adaptive brain stimulation,10106490,K23NS120037,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Craniocerebral Trauma', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Ganglia', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Implant', 'Impulsivity', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self Assessment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'addiction', 'affective neuroscience', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'motivated behavior', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'non-motor symptom', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward circuitry', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trial design']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,200478
"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,10199070,U19NS107466,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Histology', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nose', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reticular Formation', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'active control', 'base', 'control theory', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neuron component', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optogenetics', 'orofacial', 'physical model', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2021,2989579
"Neural correlates of active avoidance learning and their interactions with fear extinction mechanisms in PTSD patients Project Summary Primary characteristics of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) include persistent fears and excessive maladaptive avoidance behaviors. Preclinical models of PTSD have heavily investigated the brain mechanisms of fear inhibition and active avoidance learning. Significant progress has been made in translating fear conditioning and extinction data into the human brain and their implications have helped further our understanding of PTSD psychopathology. The mechanisms of active avoidance, however, have scarcely been examined in the human brain, especially within the context of maladaptive responses as in the case of PTSD. The studies proposed in this application are designed to begin to fill this scientific gap. We will use a novel conditioning and active avoidance paradigm (CAAP) to examine the neural correlates of active avoidance and fear extinction learning and explore how extinction modulates active avoidance responses in participants with and without a PTSD diagnosis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). PTSD psychopathology involves dysfunctional limbic-frontal activity including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampus (HPC), and amygdala. Studies of avoidance in rodents and a few fMRI studies in healthy humans suggest that the vmPFC and striatum mediate threat response by toggling the expression of fear vs. avoidance responses. Participants (healthy controls with trauma exposure, and patients diagnosed with PTSD) will undergo the novel (validated) two- day CAAP. On day 1, participants will undergo Pavlovian fear conditioning, immediately followed by an active avoidance conditioning phase. Avoidance is achieved by pressing a button to prevent a shock from occurring but will not terminate the conditioned stimulus (CS). Pavlovian fear extinction learning (button removed; no avoidance possible) will follow. On day 2, recall of extinction learning will be tested. Before the start of the recall test, participants will receive a small monetary endowment and will be told that this money could be used to pay for shock avoidance during the recall test. The first aim is to Identify neural correlates of active avoidance. The second aim is to study activations after the CS+ terminates that index the relief from the avoided shock. The third aim is to examine neural correlates of extinction-to-avoidance transfer. The proposed studies are expected to provide a more integrated mechanistic understanding of the psychopathology of PTSD and reduce the gap between the rodent literature and human neuroimaging in avoidance research. Project Narrative The experiments proposed aim to examine the neural mechanisms of active avoidance learning and explore how these mechanisms are modulated by fear extinction learning circuits. We will use a novel conditioning and avoidance paradigm to gather functional MRI and subjective reports data from healthy controls and from patients diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The anticipated impact is to enhance our understanding of the neural mechanisms of adaptive and maladaptive avoidance responses, reduce the translation gap in this area between rodents and human studies, and explore potential novel targets for advancing the treatment of PTSD.",Neural correlates of active avoidance learning and their interactions with fear extinction mechanisms in PTSD patients,10211625,R01MH123736,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Avoidance Learning', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Color', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dorsal', 'Endowment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Price', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'learning extinction', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'trauma exposure', 'willingness to pay']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,756037
"Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease The entorhinal cortex (EC) is long known to be the region affected first in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with symptoms such as disorientation, confusion and inability to navigate appearing early in life. But more recently, a region in the brainstem- locus coeruleus (LC) was found to have tau accumulation in young healthy adults, making it the first region in the brain with AD pathology. The LC is known to be important for arousal and controls the sleep/wake switch. The neurons of LC project to several regions including EC and hippocampus which are known to be important for spatial memory. Unsurprisingly, one of the earliest symptoms of AD is spatial difficulties and it is possible that early pathology in LC affects sleep leading to spatial memory deficits. With both LC and EC important for memory, we aim to identify which of them is more vulnerable to tau and Aβ pathology. To explore this possibility, we will first inject LC and EC regions of wildtype mouse with pathological tau derived from human AD brains to make them dysfunctional, and evaluate their neuronal function. We will also assess sleep and test memory performance in relevant behavior tasks. To understand how aβ affects tau pathology, we will inject human tau in the APP Knock-In mice which has physiological amounts of APP expressed in them. We will determine if Aβ together with tau worsens the neuronal function of LC and EC neurons and it sleep and memory is impaired further. We will use multi-region silicon probes to simultaneously record activity from LC or medial EC and hippocampal neurons. The MEC and hippocampal neurons are well characterized with properties that can be easily measured using spatial navigation tasks. We will make use of virtual reality head-fixed setup for the animals to navigate in, and allowing us to quickly test animal’s memory in any context and environment. The animals will be tested for object-location memory and context-dependent memory in virtual environment. We will use machine learning algorithms to decode animal’s position in the LC, MEC and HPC neural data and determine if it is affected by tau or Aβ or both. We will also assess sleep parameters and correlate with memory. We hypothesize that tau in LC and EC will make its neurons dysfunctional and directly affect sleep and memory, and this in concert with Aβ will exacerbate neuronal dysfunction leading to increased sleep problems and spatial memory impairment as seen in early AD. With this we aim to identify electrophysiological biomarker of neuronal dysfunction before the onset of behavioral troubles. We will test if increasing the neuronal firing in hypoactive neurons and reducing the firing in hyperactive neurons will restore downstream neuronal dysfunction and reverse sleep problems and cognitive impairment. The proposal brings together diverse fields (neuroscience, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical and predictive tests to interrogate function in vulnerable brain regions that are dysfunctional in AD. The locus coeruleus and the entorhinal cortex region of the brain are among the first to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, causing sleep problems and cognitive dysfunction. Using multi-region recording probes we will evaluate their function to determine which one of them is more vulnerable to tau and aβ pathology. We will test if by using optogenetic approach the neurons in these regions can be rescued and cognitive deficits be reversed.",Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease,10142333,R01AG064066,"['20 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Disorientation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mus', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'computational neuroscience', 'entorhinal cortex', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'neuron loss', 'non rapid eye movement', 'optogenetics', 'predictive test', 'rapid eye movement', 'relating to nervous system', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep regulation', 'spatial memory', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'virtual environment', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'way finding']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,622966
"Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach. Project Summary Males and females elicit aggressive behavior for resources and survival. Male aggression has been well studied in many species. However, not much is known about female aggression. Recently, my work identified a small female- specific subgroup of cells in the pC1 brain region (pC1α neurons), that triggered females to fight at extremely high intensity levels when activated. For the K99 phase, I will build on my previous work and elaborate on the pC1α neurons circuitry under the mentorship of Dr. E. Kravitz, a well-renowned expert in aggression and Drosophila genetics. Aim 1 is concerned with determining the pre- and post-synaptic partners of the pC1α neurons. For this aim, I will work with my co-mentor, Dr. R. Wilson, to determine pre- and post- synaptic partners and design transgenic fly lines to target these areas. Based on my preliminary data of electron microscopy tracings, I hypothesize that, a)SAG neurons provide inputs to pC1α neurons; and b) pC1α neurons project dendritic outputs to PVL04om_pct neurons in areas previously identified in aggression such as Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum. I anticipate that both up- and down-stream pC1α neurons partners will induce high intensity female aggression. Aim 2 will investigate the role of candidate aggression-associated genes in pC1α neurons. I will train in single-cell profiling methods (used by the Kravitz lab) and address the hypothesis that genes overexpressed in male aggression mediating neurons also play key role in pC1α neuron function. In collaboration with co-mentor Dr. B de Bivort, I will also use neural network-based body part tracking software to train a classifier to automatically label aggressive behaviors. This will allow me to use machine-learning algorithms to capture multi-dimensional representations of the phenotypic differences among fly lines with mutations and transgenic effectors that target aggression circuits (e.g, activating and inhibiting a neuron or overexpressing aggregating proteins). The trainings acquired in my mentored K99 phase will facilitate my transition to independent research studying age-related diseases and behavior. Severe behavioral disturbances of aggression and agitation have been reported to be increasingly common during the progression of Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias.The reasons for this are completely unknown. Moreover, there is a dearth of understanding of how changes in neurons, during neurodegeneration, lead to specific behavioral defects. For the R00 phase, I will shift my focus to looking at aggression in neurodegenerative disease models and begin my efforts by elucidating the contribution of neuronal protein aggregates of Aβ-42 to aggression. My preliminary data indicates that overexpression of human Aβ-42 in using a (pan-neuronal driver) in males and (cholinergic driver) in females induces heightend levels of aggression. Based on these findings, I hypothesize Aβ-42 overexpression induced aggression is due to altered excitability of key aggression promoting neurons. I plan to use diverse and integrative systems approaches (learned from my mentored phase). I will lead a multi-pronged research effort to understand the mechanisms by which neurons regulate their normal function in the presence of an aging and or neurodegenerative disease state and how these changes affect circuit pathways and ultimately aggression. Project Narrative Aggression accompanies a number of common human neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's and other related dementias), with little understanding of how cognitive and aggression symptoms may be linked at the neuronal level. Aggression has been extensively studied in males of many species, but neglected in females (likewise, the interaction of sex and age is neglected). The objective of this research program is to identify the neural circuitry that governs female aggression (K99- mentored phase) and later transition (R00- independent phase) into discovering mechanisms of dementia-related pathology and how these changes affect aggression.",Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach.,10192224,K99GM141449,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Female', 'Ganglia', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Instinct', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'PC3 cell line', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical aggression', 'Play', 'Population', 'RNA Interference', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Senile Plaques', 'Social Behavior', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'bullying', 'cholinergic', 'cholinergic neuron', 'common symptom', 'connectome', 'design', 'extracellular', 'fighting', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal excitability', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein aggregation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sex', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,100000
"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,10171740,R00AG054732,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Arousal', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Comparative Study', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Dopamine', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Foundations', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Norepinephrine', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Psychological Theory', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'comparative', 'emerging adult', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'information processing', 'lens', 'neural network', 'psychobiology', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'visual information', 'young adult']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2021,247426
"Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network Contact PD/PI: BARACK, DAVID L The ability to learn and think about complex situations is central to a range of human cognitive functions, including navigation, reasoning, and decision making. Numerous theories across these domains rely on representations of states of these external and internal environments, but how they acquire such representations remains unknown. My overall goal is to understand how animals, including humans, can reason and learn in such complex environments. In this project, we propose to investigate how animals are able to learn these representations in a complex sequential decision making task in monkeys. Using a novel behavioral task inspired by the board game battleship, monkeys search for hidden shapes on a screen. There are millions of possible shapes, and yet monkeys are capable learners, vastly outperforming classic reinforcement learning algorithms. How monkeys can learn the shapes so quickly remains mysterious. In addition to these unknown computational foundations for learning, the neural mechanisms that support this behavior are also unexplored. Recent studies including electrophysiology and lesion research have found signatures of state representations in the amygdala (AMYG) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, these studies have only used very few states that only require associations to learn. Moreover, the interactions and computational roles of the regions have not been characterized. In light of these gaps in our understanding of learning in complex tasks, we will use the battleship task to elucidate 1) the aspects of the environment that drive learning representations of complex states, 2) the computational foundations of this learning using behavioral model fitting and deep neural networks, and 3) the neural mechanisms that underwrite this capacity in the AMYG-OFC circuit. We hypothesize that OFC represents hidden task states, those that cannot be fully defined in terms of perceptible stimuli and outcomes. We further hypothesize that AMYG plays a central role in learning and updating these representations by constructing an online representation of the current environment using input from OFC as well as from sensory processing and memory regions, representing current stimuli, outcomes, and associations. We posit an observer-critic architecture underlies learning representations of complex tasks, with AMYG activity computing and sending a teaching signal to OFC that learns and updates task state representations. As part of this planned research, I will be trained in advanced modeling and neural analysis techniques, and complete a course of study on the use of deep neural networks. This training will take place under the guidance of Dr. Stefano Fusi and Dr. C Daniel Salzman in the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: BARACK, DAVID L Despite broad relevance to understanding the mind, how people are able to learn and adapt to changes in their environments remains unknown. Numerous psychiatric dysfunctions as well as healthy neurotypical processes result in deficient ability to learn and update representations of complex, real-world situations. We will use electrophysiological techniques in nonhuman primates and advanced computational modeling to begin to investigate how people can so quickly learn and adapt to a complex world.

"Revealing the organization and functional significance of neural timescales in auditory cortex Project Summary People are remarkably adept at making sense of the world through sound: understanding speech in a noisy restaurant, picking out the voice of a family member, or recognizing a familiar melody. Although we take these abilities for granted, they reflect impressive computational feats of biological engineering that are remarkably difficult to replicate in machine systems. The long-term goal of my research program is to develop computational and experimental methods to reverse-engineer how the brain codes natural sounds like speech and to exploit these advances to understand and aid in the treatment of hearing impairment. One of the central challenges of coding natural sounds is that they are structured at many different timescales from milliseconds to seconds and even minutes. How does the brain integrate across these diverse timescales to derive meaning from sound? Answering this question has been challenging because there are no general-purpose methods for measuring neural timescales in the brain. As a consequence, we know relatively little about how neural timescales are organized in auditory cortex and how this organization enables the coding of natural sounds. To overcome these limitations, we develop a simple experimental paradigm (the “temporal context invariance” or TCI paradigm) for estimating the temporal integration period of any sensory response: the time window during which stimuli alter the response. We apply the TCI method to human electrocorticography (ECoG) and animal physiology recordings to reveal the organization of neural timescales at both the region and single-cell level (Aim I). Pilot data from our analyses reveal that timescales are organized hierarchically, with higher-order regions showing substantially longer integration periods. To explore the functional significance of this timescale hierarchy, we couple TCI with computational techniques well-suited for characterizing natural sounds (Aim II). We test whether increased integration periods enable a more noise-robust representation of speech (Aim IIA), whether regions with longer integration periods code higher-order properties of natural sounds (Aim IIB&IIC), whether there are dedicated integration periods for important sounds categories like speech or music (Aim IID), and whether cortical integration periods can be explained by the duration of the features they respond to (Aim IIE). In the process of conducting this research, I will be trained in two critical areas: (1) ECoG, which is the only method with the spatial and temporal precision to understand how neural timescales are organized in the human brain (2) deep neural networks (DNN) which are the only models able to perform challenging perceptual tasks at human levels and predict neural responses in higher-order cortical regions. After completing this training, I will have a unique set of experimental (fMRI, ECoG, psychophysics) and computational skills (data-driven statistical modeling and hypothesis-driven DNN modeling), which will facilitate my transition to an independent investigator. Project Narrative Natural sounds like speech contain information at many different timescales (e.g. phonemes, syllables, words), but how the human brain extracts this information remains unclear. Understanding this process is critical to understanding how hearing impairment degrades speech perception. The proposed research will reveal the organization of neural timescales in the brain, and how this organization facilitates the coding of natural sounds like speech, which is a critical first step in understanding how this code is impaired by hearing loss.",Revealing the organization and functional significance of neural timescales in auditory cortex,10169404,K99DC018051,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Engineering', 'Family member', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Restaurants', 'Sensory', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Voice', 'Work', 'clinically significant', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'millisecond', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,K99,2021,125442
"Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology Project Summary Listening in noise is a core problem in everyday hearing. Sound sources of interest routinely occur amid irrelevant distractors, as when you talk with someone in a bustling coffee shop. This background “noise” distorts the pattern of spikes in the auditory nerve, often to a profound degree. Thus, to recognize sources of interest, the auditory system must somehow separate or suppress the effects of the background. Typical human hearing is remarkably noise-robust, but listeners with age-related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments – and are not much helped by contemporary hearing aids. Previous work on the neural basis of noise robustness has typically employed simple, synthetic noise sources, which lack the structure present in real-world sounds, and this work has focused on subcortical regions or on primary auditory cortex. Reasoning that real-world conditions might necessitate more complicated solutions, in the applicant's doctoral work, he considered everyday sources of noise, and leveraged the large-scale coverage afforded by fMRI to examine noise robustness throughout human auditory cortex. Real-world “background noise” was operationalized as a natural sound with statistical properties that are stable over time (i.e., are stationary), conveying little new information about the world (e.g., swamp insects, an air conditioner, rain on pavement). The applicant measured fMRI responses in human listeners to a broad set of natural sounds presented in quiet, as well as embedded in the real-world background noises. Primary auditory cortical responses were substantially altered by the background, but non-primary responses were substantially more robust. This effect was not seen for simple synthetic backgrounds as had been used in previous work, suggesting that becoming robust to real-world background noises require different mechanisms. The applicant's thesis work demonstrates where noise invariance arises, but understanding how will require data with finer spatial and temporal resolution, and thus the proposed postdoctoral research will consist of training in single-unit electrophysiology using marmosets. Aim 1A builds on previous work examining single- unit noise robustness in artificial conditions, extending such work to real-world noise. Aim 1B leverages texture models to probe what aspects of real-world backgrounds disrupt the encoding of foregrounds. Aim 2A deploys linear reconstruction techniques to probe population representations. Aim 2B involves optimizing deep neural networks for noise invariance tasks, and using them as an encoding model to predict single-unit responses. Furthermore, such networks will be deployed as nonlinear decoding algorithms, reconstructing stimuli from neuronal populations. Throughout all aims, the work will characterize neuronal responses in non-primary areas, and in particular in parabelt, which is understudied in primates. The proposed work may enable improvements in hearing aid algorithms or neural prosthetics. Lastly, this training will lay the groundwork for the applicant's long-term goal of developing a marmoset model for hearing loss. Project Narrative Typical human hearing is remarkably robust to the presence of background noise, but listeners with age- related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments – and often do not benefit from contemporary hearing aids in these conditions. In my doctoral work, using fMRI in humans I showed that real-world background noise engages different mechanisms than the simpler synthetic noise typically employed in previous work. In my postdoctoral work I will be trained in marmoset electrophysiology to zoom in to the level of neural circuits to probe the mechanisms that generate auditory cortex's robustness to background noise.",Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology,10115690,F32DC017628,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Callithrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Coffee', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Presbycusis', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Rain', 'Research', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'sound', 'temporal measurement']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2021,66390
"Cortical visual processing for navigation Project summary Vision plays a key role in our ability to navigate through the environment, from identifying landmarks and obstacles to determining location and heading. While studies of visual cortex have provided an understanding of properties such as orientation selectivity and object recognition, much less is known about how cortical circuitry extracts and processes features from the visual scene to support navigation. In particular, there are two challenges. First, the nature of the visual stimulus is dramatically different in navigation, where the subject's movement through the world creates a complex and dynamic visual input, in contrast to standard synthetic stimuli presented to stationary subjects. Second, the types of visual features and computations that must be performed are different in navigation than in standard detection or discrimination paradigms. Our goal in this proposal is to determine how the brain extracts relevant visual features from the rich, dynamic visual input that typiﬁes active exploration, and investigate how the neural representation of these features can support visual navigation.  We will investigate this through three parallel aims, that build up from the representation of the visual scene in V1 during freely moving navigation, to the computation of speciﬁc variables needed for navigation. In our ﬁrst aim, we will measure the visual input in freely moving mice using miniature head-mounted cameras, together with neural activity in V1, to determine how neural dynamics represent the visual scene during natural navigation. In our second aim, we will use large ﬁeld-of-view two-photon imaging of multiple cortical areas, while mice navigate in a naturalistic open-world virtual reality system, to determine how visual features are represented across visual cortical areas. In our third aim, we will use 2-photon imaging in mice in a rotational arena to determine how visual input is used to dynamically update a key navigational variable: heading direction. Together, this project bridges foundational measurements in freely moving animals with mechanistic circuit investigations, to provide insights into an important aspect of visual system function. Project Narrative This project will study how the brain processes visual information to support navigation, which is important for guiding goal-directed movement through the world. The results of this work will provide knowledge about normal visual function and insights for treating impaired vision via prosthetic or assistive devices.",Cortical visual processing for navigation,10208550,R01NS121919,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'deep neural network', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'optic flow', 'orientation selectivity', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'synergism', 'theories', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality system', 'virtual world', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2021,2833387
"Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking Project Summary Walking is an essential and conserved behavior across the animal kingdom. The ability to move in a coordinated, robust yet flexible manner is a crucial for an animal’s survival in the ever changing environment. Motor behaviors are controlled by sensory neuropils in the brain which talk to motor centers such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the thorax to execute precise motor outputs. Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic. Project Narrative An animal’s ability to walk in a regulated manner is controlled by the brain through coordinated neural circuitry. Descending neurons are the bridges connecting the brain to the motor centers in thorax that then controls limbed coordination and movement but the exact circuitry downstream of descending neurons responsible for walking remain undefined.

Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic. Project Narrative An animal’s ability to walk in a regulated manner is controlled by the brain through coordinated neural circuitry. Descending neurons are the bridges connecting the brain to the motor centers in thorax that then controls limbed coordination and movement but the exact circuitry downstream of descending neurons responsible for walking remain undefined. This project aims to map these downstream functional circuit components using neuronal translabeling approaches and assess their contribution to precise, robust and flexible motor behavior in Drosophila.",Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking,10388902,F32MH123012,"['ARNT gene', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anions', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Cloning', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Environment', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Nerve', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Walking', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fly', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'mind control', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2021,2500
"Investigating Ventral CA1 Neural Representations of Anxiety-Like Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to detect and appropriately respond to potentially threatening situations is critical for survival. Dysregulation of the neural systems which mediate these functions can lead to pathological avoidance of ordinary environments and persistent feelings of imminent threat, key components of the negative emotional state characteristic of anxiety disorders. Many studies have begun to reveal the brain regions and neural circuits that control avoidance behavior and encode states of anxiety. Specifically, the ventral hippocampus has emerged as a critical node for emotional behaviors including those evoked by anxiogenic environments. Our lab and others have found that subpopulations of single neurons in ventral CA1 are activated by aversive environments, but this selectivity does not generalize across different tasks used to assay anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, it is unclear which inputs to the ventral hippocampus provide the emotional information that drives this anxiety-related neural activity. The mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety states is still unknown and investigating how this brain region represents these emotional states is an essential step towards understanding the neural substrates of anxiety disorders. In this proposal, I will utilize pose estimation algorithms and unsupervised behavioral segmentation (Aim 1), in vivo calcium imaging and neural population analyses (Aim 2), along with simultaneous input-specific optogenetic inhibition and calcium imaging (Aim 3) to characterize the behavioral manifestations of anxiety-like emotional states and determine how they are encoded in the ventral hippocampus. Successful completion of this study will help to elucidate the role of the ventral hippocampus in anxiety, potentially opening new research avenues for the development of neural circuit based therapeutics to treat anxiety disorders. These data along with the research and scientific expertise developed through this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 Fellowship Award will support my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Anxiety is characterized by a persistent and disruptive negative emotional state. This proposal will utilize pose estimation algorithms, unsupervised behavioral segmentation, neural population analyses, and simultaneous in vivo calcium imaging and input-specific optogenetic inhibition to investigate the mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety-like emotional states.

"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as “abstract” contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,10053729,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Feeling', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Mood Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'memory process', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurophysiology', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,682901
"Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data SUMMARY Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as a spike train, comes from an individual neuron. Another, the local field potential (LFP), is based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. For both kinds of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationarity. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities, but they also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. To provide the most useful information for designing novel therapies it is important to characterize the interactions among different parts of the brain, and the timing of these interactions relative to behavior. The research in this grant aims to develop methods for analyzing the ways that a network of brain areas may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior. This involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales: slower timescales can provide insight into states of the brain, such as the extent to which a subject is paying attention to a task; fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFPs) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). NARRATIVE Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statistical analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data,10226112,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Structure', 'ImProv', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vector']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,373940
"Mapping Algorithmic State Space in the Human Brain Abstract Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to respond correctly to novel contextual situations on the first attempt, without prior rehearsal. We refer to this ability as ‘ad hoc self-programming’: ‘ad hoc’ because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; ‘self-programming’ because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. The overall goal of our research effort is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  Our previous U01 project (NS 108923) focused on how these programs of action are initially created. Our results thus far have revealed tantalizing notions of how the brain represents these programs and navigates through them. In this proposal, therefore, we focus on the question of how these mental programs are executed. Based on our preliminary findings and critical conceptual work, we propose that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) creates representations of the critical elements of these mental programs, including concepts such as ‘rules’ and ‘locations’, to allow for effective navigation through the algorithm.  These data suggest the existence of an ‘algorithmic state space’ represented in medial temporal and prefrontal regions. This proposal aims to understand the neurophysiological underpinnings of this algorithmic state space in humans. By studying humans, we will profit from our species’ powerful capacity for generalization to understand how such state spaces are constructed. We therefore leverage the unique opportunities available in human neuroscience research to record from single cells and population-level signals, as well as to use intracranial stimulation for causal testing, to address this challenging problem.  In Aim 1 we study the basic representations of algorithmic state space using a novel behavioral task that requires the immediate formation of unique plans of action. Aim 2 directly compares representations of algorithmic state space to that of physical space by juxtaposing balanced versions of spatial and algorithmic tasks in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Finally, in Aim 3, we test hypotheses regarding interactions between vPFC and MTL using intracranial stimulation. Project Narrative In our everyday lives, we frequently encounter situations we have never previously faced and yet are required to make an appropriate response on the first try. This ability to rapidly and flexibly ‘self-program’ is one of the hallmark features of human intelligence. The proposed studies leverage exciting new developments in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and artificial intelligence to understand the neuronal circuitry underlying this amazing capacity.",Mapping Algorithmic State Space in the Human Brain,10199622,U01NS121472,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amaze', 'Anterior', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Cinnamon - dietary', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Link', 'Location', 'Medial', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Telemetry', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell cortex', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'design', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'mental representation', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'operation', 'physical state', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rehearsal', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'way finding']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2021,1509141
"Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution Project Summary The dynamic adaptability of the mammalian brain to environmental changes is remarkable, as it is the complexity of the networks of neurons underlying the operations that allow for such adaptations. Although we have some understanding of the anatomical and functional basis of this, we are still lacking a detailed picture of how the modulation of neuronal activity works. What is the timing and locations of these neuromodulator release and relationship with excitatory/inhibitory circuits? How does the neuromodulators circuitry accomplish the regulation of firing and synaptic properties of targeted neurons? Filling these gaps in knowledge would advance our understanding of all aspects of neuromodulator biology and allow discovery of new therapeutic strategies. To help close this gap, we have used creative approaches to the development of genetically encoded to directly report behaviorally triggered and modulated neuromodulator release including serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). We have disseminated these indicators to the neuroscience community and spurred major discoveries of novel mechanisms regulating neuromodulator release underlying motivation and addiction. Build on this initial success, we propose to further expand the effectiveness of this toolbox of NM sensors to enable imaging sparse release at depth and subcellular resolution. Our specific goals are to (1) improve the sensitivity of our current sensors to enable robust imaging of sparse neuromodulator release, push their spatial resolution to the subcellular level and increase linearity of response at lower concentrations; (2) expand their spectral range to red/far-red to enhance imaging depth, SNR and in vivo multiplex measurement and manipulation of multiple circuit components using two or three distinct colors, and (3) characterize the possible interference of current sensors with endogenous signaling and systematically validate emerging sensors with a wide-ranging microscopy approaches in vivo. Our strategy relies on a dynamic collaboration between the sensor design team and end users to obtain continuous feedback to implement efficient improvements to the sensors. It is our goal to rapidly disseminate a wide range of well-characterized, highly sensitive indicators for the neuroscience community to be employed to study behaving mice, fish, flies and worms, to enrich our knowledge on the functional roles of neuromodulators in the brain circuitry. Altered neurotransmitter and neuromodulator (NM) signaling is a key feature of virtually all human neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction. We will engineer, validate and disseminate optimized genetically encoded sensors for visualizing neuronal communication with enhanced depth and resolution using advanced microscopy techniques. Combined with optogenetics and calcium/voltage imaging, applications of these tools will reveal the full richness of neuromodulatory signaling to greatly extend, and potentially transform, our understanding of how neurochemical inputs influence cell and circuit function in health and disease.",Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution,10166304,U01NS120820,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Effectiveness', 'Endorphins', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Fishes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photometry', 'Photons', 'Property', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental change', 'extracellular', 'fly', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'minimally invasive', 'monoamine', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nerve supply', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2021,869559
"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,10113371,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,380647
"CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations Throughout the brain, specialized systems carry out different but complementary functions, sometimes  independently but often in cooperation. However, we do not understand how their activity is dynamically  coordinated, and dysregulation of this is associated with many mental health conditions. Neuronal oscillations, which are detectable in local field potentials (LFPs) at various frequencies, are a promising  target for this coordination. Gamma oscillations (40-100 Hz) in particular have been singled out since they enhance stimulus responses, facilitate interactions between brain regions, and are expressed ubiquitously across cortical and subcortical regions. Indeed, gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral  nucleus of the amygdala (BL), an important regulator of emotional behaviors. BL gamma oscillations are  enhanced during periods of heightened vigilance during a foraging task, following emotionally salient experiences, and upon presentation of socially-relevant stimuli. The variety of circumstances that engage  it make it a promising target for interventions affecting emotional behaviors in general. However, technical challenges abound because gamma manifests as brief intermittent oscillatory bursts, layered atop numerous ongoing activities in other frequency bands. This precludes manipulating gamma exclusively with traditional pharmacological, optogenetic, or chemogenetic approaches, since these have substantial  effects on ongoing non-gamma activities, and are delivered irrespective of whether gamma bursts are present or absent. To overcome this, a closed-loop algorithm was developed that monitors the LFP in  real-time for gamma oscillations and delivers precisely timed optogenetic stimulation capable of enhancing or suppressing gamma strength on a cycle-by-cycle basis. While this improves upon the status  quo,, further refinement is needed. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to clarify how the gamma modulation technique operates via biophysically detailed modeling of the local circuits in the BL that generate gamma, the effects of optogenetic stimulation, and the closed-loop algorithm. Aim 2 designs better signal  processing routines for detecting and parameterizing gamma in real-time. Aim 3 develops an approach to  create customized biophysical models that reproduce the properties of gamma observed in individual  subjects, which when combined with the results of Aims 1 and 2 should allow for optimized control over gamma oscillations in individual subjects. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region implicated in emotional regulation.  By developing improved methods to manipulate these oscillations, we hope to better understand their  function and improve our ability to control emotional states and behaviors. n/a",CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations,10207403,R01MH122023,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Emotional', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rodent Model', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'biophysical model', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional behavior', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'vigilance']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2021,284005
"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement.

"Elucidating novel features of visual processing and physiological connectivity from retina to primary visual cortex Project Summary The use of stimuli with increasingly naturalistic properties has become critical to advance our understanding of vision. Many studies demonstrate that simple artificial stimuli (e.g. sinusoidal gratings and white noise) fail to engage nonlinearities that profoundly alter responses in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and primary visual cortex (V1). A recent and striking example comes from the use of naturalistic ‘flow’ stimuli, which engage robust responses in V1 that are not predicted from responses to gratings. This gap in understanding motivates the development of a stimulus ensemble and analysis framework that produces a quantitative understanding of visual processing to increasingly naturalistic stimuli and the nonlinearities that they engage. Our objective is to understand how flow stimuli are processed from retina through visual cortex. To meet this goal, we will make neural population recordings in retina (Aims 1 & 3), LGN (Aims 1 & 3) and V1 (Aim 3) using matched experimental conditions and a unified theoretical/modeling framework to map the transformations that occur across these stages of visual processing. Our central hypothesis is that V1 transforms a discrete and heavily light-level-de- pendent retinal representation of natural stimuli into a continuous (uniform) representation that is relatively in- variant to changes in the mean luminance. This invariance places a strong constraint on the class of nonlineari- ties that transform retinal responses to those observed in LGN and V1. We test this hypothesis in three aims: (1) determine early visual processing (retina & LGN) of naturalistic flow stimuli; (2) develop an encoding manifold to capture the population activity at each processing stage and transforms from one stage to the next; (3) test the ability of the manifold description to predict the impact of light adaptation on processing flow stimuli from retina to V1. Aim 1 will yield a matched experimental dataset to an interesting and novel class of ecologically-relevant stimuli. Aim 2 will yield a quantitative framework by which to understand the transformations that occur between retina, LGN, and V1. Aim 3 will provide a platform for globally perturbing the output of the retina by switching from photopic to mesopic and scotopic conditions, and thereby compare predictions of our model to measured changes in LGN and V1 activity. The primary significance of this research is that it will provide a computationally and experimentally unified framework for understanding the transformations that occur in the processing of stim- uli across multiple stages of visual processing. The major innovations are (1) presenting visual stimuli for retinal recordings that are matched to eye movements and pupil dynamics in alert animals; (2) creating a novel analysis framework that captures the responses of neurons at all three levels and the inter-level transformations to in- creasingly complex stimuli; (3) utilizing light adaptation as a method of perturbing retinal output to test our model and the stability (invariance) of LGN and V1 responses to adapting retinal signals. The expected outcome is a data-driven model of the processing from retina to LGN and V1 that generalizes from starlight to sunlight. Project Narrative Restoring vision to the blind likely requires understanding how retinal signals are communicated to the brain and how these signals are transformed in the thalamocortical pathway.

"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function.

"Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Auditory WM dysfunctions are evidenced in individuals with speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as central auditory processing disorders (CAPD). Better understanding of auditory WM would help develop more precise biomarkers and targeted interventions for these deficits. Evidence for neuronal activation related to auditory WM patterns have been found in laboratory animals as well as in non- invasive human neuroimaging studies, both in auditory cortices (AC) and elsewhere in the brain. Recent human fMRI data also provide some evidence on item-specific activation patterns in ACs and frontal cortices. However, exactly where in the brain auditory WM content is stored and, more importantly, how the memorized information is represented is still unclear.  This research program pursues a better understanding of human auditory WM by attempting to infer its contents from the brain: Using state-of-the-art non-invasive neuroimaging and advanced signal-analysis methods we will search for cortical activation patterns that would predict item-specific WM information. We will examine brain function non-invasively with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional MRI (fMRI), and validate the findings using intracranial EEG (iEEG) measurements in presurgical patients. Recent studies suggest that, instead of persistent activation patterns, WM is supported by short-term synaptic facilitation, i.e., ""activity-silent"" population-level mechanisms. We hypothesize that these activity-silent representations could be decoded by analyzing the aftereffects of generic auditory ""impulse stimuli"" or TMS, which are utilized to ""ping"" the underlying cortical network during memory maintenance. We also hypothesize that although auditory WM likely involves co-operation of multiple brain regions, which are involved in articulatory-motor functions, perceptual categorization, or semantic processing, the retention of auditory-sensory attributes such as spectrotemporal modulation patterns critically depends on ACs. To examine WM of such auditory attributes, we will use tasks with dynamic ripple sound stimuli, which are spectrotemporally similar to human vocalizations but resist non-auditory processing strategies.  The major significance of this project is that it will increase the understanding of auditory WM, a crucial cognitive function whose neuronal bases have remained elusive. The results may also help develop more precise tools for characterizing auditory WM dysfunctions in hearing and communication deficits as well as in disorders such as dyslexia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Our research program pursues a better theoretical understanding of this crucial cognitive function using advanced multimodal neuroimaging methods, validated using intracranial recordings in pre-surgical patients.

"Mechanisms for internal models in a cerebellum-like circuit Project Summary/Abstract Predicting the consequences of action is a vital function of the nervous system. The hypothesized neural substrate are so-called internal models that transform information about outgoing motor commands and the current sensory state into predictions of sensory input. Such internal models are likely critical for a wide range of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions and their disruption has been implicated in neurological disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Nevertheless, it has proven challenging to understand how internal models are implemented in neural circuits in the mammalian brain. Our prior studies were successful in developing a detailed mechanistic understanding of how neurons in the electrosensory lobe (ELL) of mormyrid fish predict and cancel out the sensory consequences of a simple behavior--the electric organ discharge (EOD) pulse. However, because these studies were performed in immobilized animals, the nature of the predictions studied was limited in scope and complexity. This renewal uses novel methods for neural recording and high-resolution behavior monitoring in freely swimming fish to study the more complex internal models underlying the remarkable active electrolocation abilities of electric fish. Computational modeling approaches will be used both to rigorously define the problem facing the active electrosensory system and to generate and test realistic circuit-level models of how they may be solved. The key components of such models, including synaptic plasticity, recurrent and feedforward connectivity, and biophysical compartmentalization of axonal and dendritic spikes, are common to many neural systems including the cerebellum, hippocampus, and neocortex. Hence insights from these studies are expected to be widely relevant to understanding how internal models are implemented in neural systems. Project Narrative Although the ability of the nervous system to predict sensory input is critical for accurate perceptions, coordinated movements, and normal cognitive function, detailed accounts of the underlying neural circuitry and plasticity are lacking. This proposal addresses this challenge by applying novel experimental approaches and theoretical modeling to an advantageous model system where neural correlates for learned predictions are highly accessible to mechanistic investigation. The detailed circuit-level models we plan to develop will provide a foundation for understanding how disruptions of predictive mechanisms contribute to neurological disorders.",Mechanisms for internal models in a cerebellum-like circuit,10206425,R01NS075023,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Electric Fish', 'Electric Organ', 'Electrodes', 'Electrostatics', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immobilization', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Lobe', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mormyridae', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Posture', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Swimming', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,538626
"Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning Learning is how organisms adapt to changes in their environment and involves the coordination of neural systems mediating cognition, emotion, and motor control. The major goal of the proposed research program is to elucidate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems during associative learning. Interactions between these neural systems are particularly important because the context and emotional significance of stimuli provide essential information for acquisition and performance of motor responses. The breakdown of interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems in various neurological disorders can therefore have devastating consequences for learned behaviors. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and cerebellum play significant roles in cognition, emotional responses, and motor learning, respectively. The proposed research program constitutes a comprehensive analysis of cerebellar interactions with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during associative motor learning. Our general conceptual framework is that the cerebellum receives inputs from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex via the pons regarding which stimuli are important and when they occur, and the cerebellum then sends error-driven feedback to these forebrain systems to facilitate learning about important events. This conceptual framework takes into account the bidirectional relationship between the cerebellum and the relevant forebrain systems as well as interactions between forebrain systems. Multi-site electrophysiology, pathway-specific optogenetics, and precise behavioral analyses will be combined to investigate circuit-level interactions between the cerebellum, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex during associative learning and extinction (inhibitory learning) training. The proposed studies would significantly advance understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying cerebellar interactions with the forebrain. This would be a substantial contribution to the field because it has been known that the cerebellum must interact with the forebrain in many contexts that are crucial for everyday life such as learning, memory, planning, control of emotions, and communication, but very little is known mechanistically about how the cerebellum interacts with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Memory deficits are found with many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and following stroke; the breakdown of interactions between memory systems can be particularly debilitating. This proposal examines the neural mechanisms underlying interactions between emotional and motor memory systems during associative learning. Elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying memory system interactions is potentially important for developing treatments for memory deficits.",Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning,10069403,R01NS088567,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Blinking', 'Cerebellum', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Data', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pontine structure', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Prosencephalon', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'granule cell', 'indexing', 'learned behavior', 'learning extinction', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,379571
"Behavioral and neural algorithms for decision confidence Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of our investigations is to understand how neural circuits in the frontal cortex support decision- making. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in decision-making under uncertainty and is thought to enable humans and other animals to make predictions about outcomes more accurately. The objective of this proposal is to determine the algorithms responsible for confidence-guided behaviors and their neural basis in the mammalian brain.  Previous work from our laboratory has shown that `decision confidence', a cognitive variable, is encoded in single OFC neurons and OFC inactivation specifically impairs a confidence-guided behavior, time investment. The proposed experiments are designed to determine the computational and neural algorithms responsible for two confidence-guided behaviors: time investment and choice strategy updating (learning). Our central hypothesis is that OFC generates an abstract representation of decision confidence, independent of sensory evidence, that supports multiple confidence-guided behaviors. To test this idea, we have designed a quantitative psychophysical task for rats, adapted from human and primate work, that enable behavioral readouts of confidence, as a post-decision temporal wager. Simply, after each perceptual decision (olfactory or auditory) rats invest time waiting for a delayed, uncertain reward. These graded- duration time investments serve as a behavioral report of confidence that the perceptual decision just made will result in the success of the perceptual decision. First, we will develop computational algorithms to explain confidence-guided time investment and learning, and second we will identify neural substrates of these algorithms in the OFC. Third, we will determine if OFC representations are sensory-modality and behavioral-output general and test the causal role of OFC using inactivations. Finally, we will map a sensory route for auditory information to inform OFC representations and test the hypothesis that auditory cortex lesions lead to deaf-hearing, the ability to discriminate sounds without perceptual confidence.  These contributions are significant, in our opinion, because they will provide critical missing information about the algorithmic and neural foundations of decision confidence, a key cognitive variable. Our approach is innovative, chiefly because we have developed a computational and behavioral framework to study confidence in rats. Beyond these mechanistic studies, the proposed work will advance knowledge about the frontal cortical logic of cognitive variable representations and inform an improved framework for understanding how impairments in a single brain area can lead to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, as seen in depression, obsessive- compulsive and psychotic disorders. Project narrative This proposal aims to identify the computational algorithms of two confidence-guided behaviors, time investment and choice strategy updating, and the neural processes underlying these. We will use a combination of electrophysiology, viral tracing, optogenetics in a quantitative confidence-reporting behavior in rats, interpreted with computational modeling and statistical analysis.

"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive. Indeed, recurrent or inappropriately expressed fearful memories are a major component of several psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Therefore, understanding how memory traces for fearful events are formed, change over time, under what conditions they remain specific or generalize, and how they are impacted by behavioral extinction are critical questions to not only understanding how the brain uses information but also for informing the development of new treatment/prevention strategies for disorders characterized by inappropriate fear memories. Here two PIs (Drs. Josselyn and Frankland), both New Investigators, will combine their expertise to address these important questions. Because all techniques are associated with caveats and limitations, we will use a variety of techniques including optogenetic manipulation, brain-wide neuronal activity mapping and the use of graph-theory to produce “engram maps” and real time in vivo calcium imaging combined with behavior. Together, the ability to manipulate and observe an engram as it forms, changes over time and with behavioral extinction is innovative and may lead to a shift in the very definition of an engram, as well as increase our understanding for developing treatments aimed at resolving inappropriate fear memories. Project Narrative More effective treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders will be facilitated by better understanding how the brain forms memory traces supporting fear memories, how these change over time and with extinction.","The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction",10087966,R01MH119421,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endoscopes', 'Event', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Opsin', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Virus', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'data analysis pipeline', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'fear memory', 'graph theory', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory consolidation', 'neuronal excitability', 'optogenetics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHLDRN (TORONTO),R01,2021,337780
"Early representation of 3D volumetric shape in visual object processing Project Summary The goal of this project is to test a novel theoretical framework for understanding how the ventral pathway subserves object vision. In the standard framework, a series of neural operations on 2D image data through many intermediate cortical stages, including area V4, leads to high-level perceptual representations, including representation of object identity, at the final stages of the ventral pathway. However, our preliminary microelectrode data from a fixating monkey show that many neurons in V4 represent volumetric (volume- enclosing) 3D shape, not 2D image patterns. These neurons respond to many different 2D images that convey the same 3D shape with different shape-in-depth cues, including shading, reflection, and refraction. They even respond preferentially to random dot stereograms that convey 3D volumetric shape with no 2D cues whatsoever. Moreover, our preliminary results with 2-photon functional imaging in anesthetized monkey V4 show that 3D shape signals are grouped by their similarity, and also group with isomorphic (same outline) 2D shape signals (which could contribute evidence to corresponding 3D shape inferences). We propose to capitalize on these preliminary data by demonstrating the prevalence of 3D shape tuning in area V4, analyzing the 3D shape coding strategies used by these neurons, and measuring how 2D and 3D shape signals are arranged at a microscopic level across the surface of V4. We expect these results to provide strong evidence that extraction of 3D shape fragments is a primary goal of V4 processing. This early extraction of 3D shape information, just two synapses beyond primary visual cortex, would suggest a competing framework for understanding the ventral pathway, in which the initial goal is to represent 3D physical structure, independent of the various 2D image cues used to infer it. In this framework, object recognition would be based on preceding information about 3D physical structure, which would explain why human object recognition is so robust to image changes, in a way that the best computational vision systems are not. The scientific impact of this work would be to divert vision experiments toward understanding representation of real world 3D structure (rather than 2D planar stimuli) and to encourage computational vision scientists to incorporate early 3D shape processing into the deep convolutional network models that are the current state of the art. Narrative This study will help explain how the human brain achieves such remarkably robust perception of visual objects. The results will help guide future rehabilitative and prosthetic strategies for patients with visual impairments, by elucidating neural strategies that could be used to bring computer vision prosthetics up to human performance levels, and by discovering specific neural signals for object information that could be replicated by electrode array implants in higher-level visual cortex.",Early representation of 3D volumetric shape in visual object processing,10173788,R01EY029420,"['3-Dimensional', '3D world', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Microelectrodes', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Ocular Prosthesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'area V4', 'area striata', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'experimental study', 'individual response', 'network models', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'three dimensional structure', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality', 'visual object processing']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,532112
"Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion PROJECT SUMMARY Little is known about the neural mechanisms that regulate natural dynamic cues during human social and emotional interactions, although these mechanisms are impaired in many psychiatric and neurological disorders. Although it is widely understood that social signals such as facial expressions carry salient, but implicit, emotional and social cues, these “real-time” pathways have not been investigated with dual-brain neuroimaging techniques. This unmet need is largely due to technological limitations that prevent neuroimaging of two or more individuals during natural interactive situations. We overcome this technical “roadblock” with recent advances in an emerging human brain imaging technology, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This non-invasive technique detects active neural tissue based on hemodynamic signals measured by variations in the absorption spectra associated with oxyhemoglobin and de-oxyhemoglobin. Because detectors and emitters are surface mounted on the head, absent a high magnetic field, they are relatively insensitive to head movement and thus successfully applied to dyadic experiments. The focus of this proposal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie dynamic cross-brain neural coupling during real interpersonal interactions. Cross-brain neural coupling is defined as the correlation between the temporal patterns of the signals of two brains. It has been proposed that these matched patterns represent shared neural processes including dynamic exchanges of information. However, the basic assumptions of shared information and temporal resonance patterns between specific brain-to-brain regions has not been tested. We pioneer tests of these hypothesis using eye-to-eye contact as a metric of shared information and predict that dynamic neural coupling between the two brains will increase with increasing numbers of eye-to-eye contact events. Mimicry of facial expressions is also a metric of emotional contagion as well as shared information between brains. We further test the hypothesis that neural coupling will increase with the level of mimicry also by virtue of the shared information Confirmation of the hypothesis that neural coupling represents shared information between the two brains would provide a singular advance for understanding mechanisms for dynamic interactions. Both approaches include variations of emotive expressions to test the additional hypothesis that content as well as shared information might influence dynamic coupling mechanisms. Findings from these studies are expected to open a new direction for the study of live and dynamic interactions between individuals, and provide foundational components to a general framework for models of face-to-face interactions. A long-term goal is to understand the neural underpinnings of affective disorders as they present in clinically-relevant and real-world situations. Project Narrative How do two brains interact? We pioneer a novel neuroimaging technology, near infrared spectroscopy, to investigate basic mechanisms of neural coupling between two dynamically interacting individuals. Using these new methods we test the fundamental hypothesis that neural coupling (temporal synchrony between two brains) represents shared information across the two brains.",Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion,10084718,R01MH119430,"['Affective', 'Arousal', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Eyebrow structure', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Negative Valence', 'Oral cavity', 'Oxyhemoglobin', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'contagion', 'deoxyhemoglobin', 'detector', 'dyadic interaction', 'emotional reaction', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'magnetic field', 'mimicry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,399738
"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,10207798,R01NS104892,"['Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'squid axon', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,386750
"Access to parietal action representations after stroke lesions in visual cortex PROJECT SUMMARY  The ability to recognize and use objects according to their function (e.g., fork, hammer, pencil) requires integration of visual, semantic and action knowledge across occipital, temporal and parietal areas. Left parietal regions support critical aspects of object-directed action, such as grasping and object manipulation. This research activity uses a combination of fMRI and behavioral measures in patients with ischemic strokes to early and extrastriate visual areas to test the following hypotheses: Aim 1: There is a visual pathway to the parietal grasp region (aIPS) that bypasses processing in primary visual cortex. Aim 2: Left ventral extrastriate cortex is necessary to access manipulation information for visually presented objects. Aim 3A: Ballistic grasping actions to objects in the hemianopic field are influenced by volumetric properties (size, orientation) of targets. Aim 3B: Left ventral extrastriate lesions impair object function (e.g., `scissors used to cut') and disrupt access to manipulation knowledge from visual input. The research leverages strengths of fMRI (whole brain correlational measure) and neuropsychology (causal inference) to test new hypotheses about vision and action.  `Tools' (i.e., small manipulable objects) are an excellent domain in which to address broader questions about the integration of sensory, motor and cognitive processing. This is because tool recognition and tool use require the integration of distinct sensory, motor and cognitive representations, and the neural substrates of tool processing are well described. The research program emphasizes fresh perspectives on longstanding ideas about the dorsal and ventral visual pathways, by a) undertaking the first systematic investigation of the types of information about objects that are extracted by visual pathways that bypass primary visual cortex, and by b) studying how some parietal areas depend on inputs from the ventral stream in order to access the correct action for a given object. The research activity innovates by testing hypotheses about how lesions at different stages in the cortical visual hierarchy affect downstream processing in parietal cortex, combining neural and behavioral measures to study brain damaged patients (generating causal evidence), and by combining univariate and multivariate measures to `read out' the information content of brain regions (parietal cortex) that are anatomically remote from a lesion. The research advances understanding of how lesions in one brain region disrupt computations in other parts of the brain that depend on the damaged region for their inputs, a phenomenon (`dynamic diaschisis') that applies to brain injury generally. Advancing understanding of these basic issues using causal data has broad implications for understanding how the brain selects the correct action for the correct object, and more generally for theories of conceptual organization and causal reasoning. Understanding how the brain accesses actions from visual input has implications for related fields, such as robotics, neuroprosthetics, and evidenced based approaches for rehabilitating function after brain injury. Project Narrative Functional MRI and behavioral testing are used to test hypotheses about how strokes affecting occipital and temporal cortex disrupt access to action representations in parietal cortex. This research will advance understanding of how the brain processes visual information in support of everyday actions.",Access to parietal action representations after stroke lesions in visual cortex,10130533,R01EY028535,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alexia', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Ballistics', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Bypass', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Eating', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Imaging Device', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neuropsychology', 'Occipital lobe', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosopagnosia', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'area striata', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior test', 'blind', 'cognitive development', 'evidence base', 'extrastriate', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fovea centralis', 'grasp', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'multisensory', 'neuroprosthesis', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual motor', 'visual object processing', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,410316
"Advancing understanding of neural representations of threat perception through a novel predictive coding framework PROJECT SUMMARY Anxiety disorders affect an estimated 6.7% to 7.3% of people globally each year and incur a large burden on people’s lives. To address this urgent problem, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of the neural bases of subjective experiences in anxiety, including threat perception. Translational neuroscience has focused on animal models of defensive behavior involving a core set of regions. Although these animal models and the human subjects research they inspired have led to advances in treatment of anxiety, the mapping between neural mechanisms and subjective experience remains poorly understood. The set of regions found to support defensive behavior in animal models does not appear to be involved in all instances of fear or anxiety. The current project overcomes this barrier by integrating current models of anxiety with predictive coding models of the mind and brain. Incorporating predictive coding into models of anxiety will offer a better understanding of how neural activity relates to subjective experiences important to anxiety (e.g., threat perception). The project tests two parallel hypotheses about neural representation of threat perception suggested by predictive coding models: that neural representations of threat perception are content-specific (Aim 1) and that neural representations of threat perception depend on expectations (Aim 2). Using a single design, we manipulate content-specificity and expectations to test these two hypotheses in parallel. We use fMRI to measure brain activity and use self-report and peripheral psychophysiology to measure subjective experiences of threat perception. To the extent that participants find stimuli threatening (as indexed by self-report and psychophysiology), we hypothesize that we will observe relatively content-specific neural representations of threat. We also hypothesize that neural representations of threat will differ under conditions of expectation vs. expectancy violation. The effect of expectation may impact content-specific neural activity or activity in a core set of regions. The knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential improve understanding of the mapping between neural activity and subjective experiences. Relevant for translational neuroscience, a better understanding of the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety will be critical to closing the gap between laboratory research and more effective treatments for anxiety. More broadly, predictive coding models are models of basic brain function. Thus, the predictive coding model we propose offers a new theoretical framework that is generalizable to psychiatric illnesses involving disordered threat perception (e.g., schizophrenia) and other affective disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder). PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent work suggests that the effectiveness of treatments for anxiety has been over-estimated10-13 and development of new treatments have stalled5-8, in part, because the mapping between neural activity and subjective experiences that produce anxiety (e.g., perceiving threats) remains poorly understood. The proposed project addresses this gap in knowledge by examining the neural basis of a subjective experience important anxiety and anxiety disorders (threat perception) using a model of brain function from cognitive neuroscience. In doing so, the proposed project offers a novel theoretical framework that allows for better modeling of the relationship between neural activity and subjective experiences (e.g., threat perception) in anxiety, which has the potential to advance understanding of the mechanisms that drive anxiety and anxiety disorders.",Advancing understanding of neural representations of threat perception through a novel predictive coding framework,10240282,F32MH122062,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human Subject Research', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placebo Effect', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'anxiety treatment', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'neural model', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pain processing', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'training project', 'translational neuroscience']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,66390
"Circuits underlying threat and safety Classical conditioning has been studied in many different animal models, and even in humans. However, the larval zebrafish with its transparent brain offers a unique opportunity to observe large scale changes in synaptic structure that accompany this form of learning. Accordingly, we have developed a novel paradigm for visualizing synaptic changes that occur during classical conditioning in larval zebrafish. Using this paradigm we have observed striking region-specific changes in the distributions of synapses that drive the rewiring of neural circuits that mediate threat responses. In this grant we will expand this paradigm by monitoring neuronal activity through imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators throughout the pallium (the homolog of the amygdala) before, during and after classical conditioning and extinction. This will allow us to identify cells that comprise the circuits that control threat and safety and explore their connectivity using optogenetics. We will investigate how different sensory inputs can cause changes in the activity of those cells leading to synapse change, and the formation or extinction of associative memories. A crucial component of these studies will be the recording of field potentials to capture rhythmic activity throughout the pallium and high speed SPIM imaging of genetically encoded voltage indicators to record rhythms in individual cells. By understanding the precise timing of signals that impinge on individual cells we will uncover mechanisms that underlie synaptic plasticity. Our goal is to develop a theoretical model describing the neural circuits that underlie threat detection and how they can change as a result of associative memory formation and extinction. The research proposed in this grant is aimed at characterizing essential circuits in the larval zebrafish that control threat and safety. We will leverage the small size and transparency of the zebrafish brain in combination with state of the art imaging, genetically encoded probes, a custom software platform and biophysical modeling to study circuits at the cellular and molecular levels.",Circuits underlying threat and safety,10218722,U01NS122082,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Control Animal', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Display', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'FAIR principles', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Location', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Periodicity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioning', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'physical state', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'signal processing', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2021,4718512
"Dissociable neural mechanisms of reactive versus appetitive aggression Project Summary  Maladaptive aggression characterizes - or is comorbid with - many neuropsychiatric illnesses, and can have devastating effects on individuals, their caretakers, and healthcare professionals. Human aggression is typically demarcated as exhibiting either reactive (defensive) or appetitive (rewarding) components, and a growing literature indicates they are heavily influenced by dysregulation in amygdalar or reward circuitry, respectively. Despite a significant clinical awareness of the fundamental differences between these aggression presentations, direct preclinical characterization of their relative circuitry and associated neuronal mechanisms are currently absent. Therefore, the aim of my proposal is to obtain the obtain the necessary computational, behavioral and anatomical training to identify, interrogate, and manipulate neural populations that modulate these disparate aggressive behaviors.  This project will focus on identifying lateral septum (LS) circuit and cell-type specific mechanisms that control of reactive versus appetitive aggression, and then further interrogate the afferent projections driving these populations. The choice of this brain region is based on converging preliminary data, including my own, implicating that the LS may confer opposing roles in regulating appetitive versus reactive aggression. The circuit and cell-type specific activation of the LS will be identified using a combination of Fos (a marker of neuronal activity) immunohistochemistry, multiplex in situ hybridization, and retrograde viral tracing. Because of the limited temporal resolution of Fos during these behaviors, awake-behaving fiber photometry recording will be used to observe how LS neurons encode these types of aggression in real-time. Next, the causal significance of the LS and its afferent projections will be examined using region, circuit, and cell-type specific optogenetic manipulations. Understanding the neural mechanisms driving these types of aggression will allow for the development of more specific and effective treatments for maladaptive aggression presenting comorbid with neuropsychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Maladaptive aggression characterizes - or is comorbid with - many neuropsychiatric illnesses, and can have devastating effects on individuals, their caretakers, and healthcare professionals. Despite a long-standing knowledge of the deleterious effects of maladaptive aggression, current treatment options are largely used as pharmacological restraints rather than targeted therapies.

"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning.

"Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The mammalian visual cortex is critical for vision and has been used as a model for the rest of the cerebral cortex. In spite of this, little is known about the detailed operations of its microcircuits. In fact, the cortex is composed of many different cell types, and, it is likely that each cell type has a particular circuit function.  In the past cycle we focused on four major subtypes of cortical GABAergic interneurons (PV, SOM, VIP and chandeliers) in mouse visual cortex, using two- photon photoactivation and transgenic mice to map connections to and from interneurons in a systematic fashion. We found that interneurons often make synaptic connections with every single neighboring cell, and this promiscuity could be an important feature of the cortical inhibitory “circuit blueprint”.  In the course of these experiments we unexpectedly discovered that groups of coactive neurons, which we termed “neuronal ensembles”, account for the majority of the cortical response to visual stimuli. Moreover, ensembles also dominate spontaneous activity and have distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. Further, using two-photon optogenetics we found by chance that ensembles can be artificially imprinted into the cortex and they can be recalled by stimulating individual neurons, showing pattern completion, even days after imprinting. These intriguing results suggest that ensembles could be multicellular building blocks of cortical function, implementing a population neural code.  To pursue this discovery and test these ideas we now propose an experimental “deep dive” into the properties of these ensembles, in order to characterize their basic phenomenology, understand their synaptic circuit mechanisms and test their role in the behavior of the animal in sensory discrimination. The project will be carried out in primary visual cortex of awake behaving mice and make use of a novel two-photon holographic microscopy method that enables us to image and optically manipulate neurons in different cortical layers simultaneously.  Our work will provide a systematic anatomical and functional description of neuronal ensembles, how they regulate the activity of the cortex and how they can be manipulated and reconfigured. This could help in novel therapeutic strategies by reconfiguring pathological circuits and correct visual deficits. Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The role of coordinated neuronal activity by groups of neurons in the visual cortex is still poorly understood. In the last cycle of the grant we discovered that one can reconfigure cortical activity in mouse visual cortex using optogenetics, by imprinting and recalling artificial activity patterns, and we now propose to understand how these patterns are build and whether their manipulation can lead to changes in behavior. This work could help to understand how neural circuits in the visual cortex operate and can be altered and also help to design novel strategies to ameliorate amblyopia and cortical cerebral visual impairment by reconfiguring abnormal circuits.  ",Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex,10169447,R01EY011787,"['3-Dimensional', 'Amblyopia', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epidemic', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Optical Methods', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Population', 'Premature Infant', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area striata', 'awake', 'cell type', 'cortical visual impairment', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'imprint', 'in vivo', 'mouse genetics', 'nerve supply', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'photoactivation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-photon', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2021,384357
"Population Invariant Neural Decoding Neural interfaces hold great potential to restore movement and communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. These systems rely on neural decoding algorithms to translate recorded neural activity into, for example, movements of a prosthetic limb or intended speech sounds. However, many technical challenges limit the predictive accuracy of these decoding models, preventing widespread deployment of restorative neuroprosthetic devices. A key challenge is the limited data available to train decoding models. In existing approaches, models must be trained separately for each individual subject, usually during simple behavioral tasks, and consequently fail to generalize well to new subjects or complex naturalistic behavioral settings. This proposal leverages recent advances in machine learning that directly address these limitations by developing a new decoding model framework that is capable of combining neural data across many subjects and tasks, as well as incorporating large-scale simulated data to improve prediction accuracy. In this framework, a single global model learns an internal representation of the neural system that is invariant to variations in behavioral task and stimulus set, anatomical variations, and functional variations in neural tuning of the underlying neuronal population (i.e., population-invariant neural decoding). This global model can therefore be applied and calibrated to new subjects and behavioral tasks where little or no additional training data is available. Using an existing intracranial neural data set collected from a large number of different subjects and stimulus sets, the project will establish this new modeling approach based on deep learning architectures that are explicitly designed to incorporate data pooled across subjects and tasks. We propose to show, through validation on measured intracranial neural data, that a global neuronal population-invariant decoding model substantially improves model prediction accuracy and generalization relative to existing state-of-the-art neural decoding models across many subjects. Development and validation of this approach will open new avenues for researchers to combine disparate data sets, for example, enabling community development, improvement, and sharing of “open source” models that can be shared among research groups and effectively applied across research studies. Thus, the proposal seeks to address key limitations in present neural decoding model approaches which must ultimately convert measured neural activity into useful behavioral or communication parameters across a wide range of subjects and complex behaviors in order for translational effects to be realized in important clinical applications of neural interfaces. Neural interfaces rely on predictive models to restore lost motor or communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. This project leverages novel machine learning models that allow neural data to be pooled across large-scale multi-subject data sets, permitting an order of magnitude increase in model complexity and prediction accuracy that is immediately generalizable across large patient populations with disordered speech or motor function. The outcome of this project is a new modeling framework where a single, highly performant global model can be easily calibrated to individual patient cases with limited data while maintaining high prediction accuracy.",Population Invariant Neural Decoding,10074557,R21DC018374,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Experimental Designs', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Sound', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'TensorFlow', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'large datasets', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'premonitory sensory phenomena', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R21,2021,196250
"Sound encoding by neural populations in auditory cortex during behavior Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals adapt their hearing to perceive features of sound that are important for successful behavioral decisions. Normal-hearing humans are able to detect and discriminate important sounds in crowded noisy scenes and to understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings. Even when they can perceive sounds accurately, the additional listening effort required negatively impacts other cognitive functions. A better understanding of how the healthy auditory system operates in cognitively challenging contexts will support new treatments for these deficits. This project will study how the auditory system represents sound information as it operates in challenging acoustic environments. There are three specific aims. First, high-density microelectrode arrays will be used to record the simultaneous activity of neural populations in auditory cortex during behaviors that require detecting sounds masked by noise or learning new sound-reward associations. Recording from multiple neurons will enable characterizing how information is encoded by the simultaneous activity of neural populations. These experiments will test the hypothesis that population activity in auditory cortex generates representations that are invariant to irrelevant distracting sounds. Second, optogenetic tools will be used to identify distinct neuronal cell types (excitatory versus inhibitory) in cortex. This study will test the hypothesis that tonic activation of inhibitory neurons can explain changes in population activity during behavior. Third, machine learning tools will be used to model the simultaneously recorded neural activity. These experiments will test the hypothesis that neurons in the same local anatomical circuit in auditory cortex encode information about a relatively small domain in the space of all possible auditory stimuli. Models fit to experimental data will also describe how changes in behavioral state shift the way neurons encode sounds and describe sources of correlated population activity that impact neural discriminability during behavior. Together these experiments will establish new links between neural representation of sound and the cognitive processes that extract important information from sound for successful behavior. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairment and central neurological disorders have difficulty keeping track of speech and other complex sounds, particularly in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how populations of neurons in auditory cortex change their activity as the brain adapts to noisy environments. These experiments will provide insight into basic function of the healthy brain that can inform treatment of hearing disorders.",Sound encoding by neural populations in auditory cortex during behavior,10302718,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Ferrets', 'Frequencies', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Operating System', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pupil', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Virus', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'frontal lobe', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,320591
"Markerless Tracking of 3D Posture to Reveal the Sensory Origins of Body Schema The goal of this proposed research is to reveal the sensory origins underlying the body schema representation. Body schema is the brain's internal model of the body's spatial configuration. This internal representation is critical for sensorimotor processing, movement control, and self-awareness, and is continuously updated during movement. Body schema representations are disrupted when somatosensory input is lost. The first step toward discover the neural correlates of body schema is to uncover neural mechanisms that generate body posture representation. We hypothesize that sensory inputs from primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are transformed to construct a body posture representation.  To delineate the mechanisms underlying the neural coding of body posture, this project will utilize large- scale monitoring, apply interventional tools, develop new data analysis tools, and integrate new approaches. Our approach is to perform large-scale electrophysiological recording and novel markerless tracking of 3D posture in freely moving mice. To track posture, the first aim is to adapt a markerless tracking pipeline comprised of a deep 3D convolutional neural network to process high-speed videography of mouse behavior from multiple cameras. The second aim is to perform large-scale recording of neurons in S1, S2, and PPC and use advanced computational approaches to determine which postural features best explain the activity of neurons in these cortical areas. Finally, the third aim is to use optogenetic and projection-specific manipulations to address the causal impact of proprioceptive inputs from S1 and S2 on coding of posture in PPC. This research promises to uncover how sensory inputs are involved in generating the body schema representation and guiding behavior.  Extensive training will be required to carry out this project and achieve my goal of earning a tenure-track professor position. The rigorous methodological and intellectual environment in Dr. Fan Wang’s lab and the Duke Neurobiology community will advance my conceptual knowledge and technical skills. I will implement deep learning techniques through training and collaboration with specialists. I will learn new techniques by attending Neuropixel and computational neuroscience courses. Finally, I will develop my professional skills by frequent attendance of seminars, workshops, and meeting with a postdoctoral mentorship committee.  The proposed project will be conducted in the Department of Neurobiology at the Duke University Medical Campus. This interdisciplinary community at Duke will bolster the research and training included in this application through frequent interaction with talented and collaborative faculty, organization of seminars and symposia, numerous opportunities to practice research talks and receive valuable feedback, formation of a personalized postdoctoral mentorship committee, extensive career and professional training, and invaluable support from the postdoctoral association. Project Narrative Body schema, the brain’s internal model of the spatial configuration of its body parts, is normally updated during movement, but can be disrupted following amputation, stroke, or deafferentation. Understanding how neural circuits generate body schema representation in health and disease could pave the way for improvements in surgical practice, stroke recovery therapy, brain-machine interface technology, and prosthetic limb engineering. Furthermore, sustaining an internal model of the body is a key element of awareness of one’s own body and the body of others, so findings on the sensory origins underlying body schema will have implications ranging from sensorimotor processing, motor control, interpersonal representations, and social cognition.",Markerless Tracking of 3D Posture to Reveal the Sensory Origins of Body Schema,10216941,F32MH122995,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amputation', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data Analyses', 'Deafferentation procedure', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Experimental Models', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Self Perception', 'Sensory', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Talents', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'meetings', 'motor control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'professor', 'relating to nervous system', 'research to practice', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'social cognition', 'somatosensory', 'stroke recovery', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2021,66390
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,10159320,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,384007
"CRCNS: Neural computations for continuous control in virtual reality foraging Neuroscience has been able to gain major insights by relating measurements of neural activity to the  brain’s sensory inputs and motor outputs. Yet most neural activity supports computations and cognitive functions (‘thoughts’) that are not directly measurable by the experimenter. The investigators for the  present proposal invented a novel method to model an animal's thoughts by combining eXplainable  Artificial Intelligence (XAI) cognitive models for naturalistic tasks with measurements of the animal’s  sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. This model, called Inverse Rational Control (IRC), infers the internal model assumptions under which an animal's actions would be optimal. It then provides estimates of time series of subjective beliefs about the world that are consistent with this internal model. These estimates provide targets for a dimensionality reduction framework that assesses task-relevant  computational dynamics within neural population activity. The investigators propose to use these analysis  tools to find neural representations and transformations that implement these cognitive processes. They will apply this to a complex, naturalistic task that they developed: catching fireflies in virtual reality. The  monkeys they successfully trained to perform this task demonstrably weigh uncertainty, develop  predictions and long-term strategies, and apply nonlinear dynamics — all computations that are  fundamental for brain function. The investigators propose first to apply their method to analyze existing behavioral data and neural recordings collected in a simple version of this task with a single target firefly.  They will then collect new data on a multi-firefly version of the task, which incentivizes animals to make and implement longer-term plans. To analyze this data, the investigators will generalize their approach to  allow them to learn which compressed representations are selected by the animal as the foundation for  their strategies. These results will be used to form predictions about neural computations that will be tested using the electrophysiological data collected from multiple brain regions during this project. The  results of this study will explain the computations required to perform a complex, strategic navigation task  in the presence of uncertainty, and will demonstrate a new paradigm for understanding naturalistic brain computations. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project will uncover the neural basis of cognitive processes in the primate brain that underlie spatial  navigation, strategic planning, and behavioral control. It will demonstrate how a powerful new paradigm  for understanding complex, natural brain computations can apply to a wide variety of tasks, to explain  either adaptive or pathologically structured behavior. This will provide crucial guidance for understanding  and improving disrupted human cognitive function. n/a",CRCNS: Neural computations for continuous control in virtual reality foraging,10266181,R01NS120407,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Fireflies', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Instruction', 'Juice', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathologic', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Utah', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'way finding']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,394496
"Perceptual integration of luminance, texture and color cues for visual boundary segmentation Project Summary One of the most essential computations performed by the visual system is segmenting images into regions corresponding to distinct surfaces. This in turn requires identifying the boundaries separating image regions, a process known as boundary segmentation. Computational analyses of natural images have revealed that many visual cues are available at region boundaries, including differences in luminance, texture, and color. It is known that these cues combine for tasks like edge localization and orientation discrimination. However, it remains unclear how these various cues are weighted and combined for boundary segmentation.  In collaborative work with Canadian colleagues at McGill University in Montreal, we have developed a novel machine learning framework for characterizing human performance on boundary segmentation tasks using naturalistic micro-pattern stimuli. Our method makes use of the Filter-Rectify-Filter (FRF) model often applied to characterizing texture boundary segmentation. The major innovation of our approach is that we fit the FRF model directly to thousands of psychophysical stimulus-response observations to estimate its major defining parameters. We have recently applied this approach to investigating spatial strategies for contrast boundary segmentation and comparing competing hypotheses of how contrast modulation is integrated across orientation channels. In this grant, we propose to apply both classical psychophysical techniques and our novel machine learning methodology to understanding the computations employed to combine luminance, texture and color cues for segmentation.  In Aim 1, we focus on modeling segmentation of luminance-defined boundaries, comparing the case where each surface has uniform luminance, giving rise to a sharp edge (luminance step), to the more naturalistic case where the two surfaces have differing proportions of dark and light micro-patterns on either side of the boundary with no sharp edge (luminance texture). We will apply our machine learning methodology to test the hypothesis that different neural mechanisms may be involved in segmenting these two different kinds of luminance boundaries. In Aim 2, we ask how observers integrate first-order (luminance) and second-order (texture) cues for boundary segmentation, and if there are differences in cue combination strategies for luminance steps and luminance textures. We will also compare models embodying competing hypotheses of the underlying neural mechanisms of cue combination. In Aim 3, we extend the analyses in Aims 1 and 2 beyond simple luminance differences to include differences in color. Finally, Aim 4 is a pedagogical aim of promoting undergraduate research. Project Narrative Segmenting natural images into regions corresponding to distinct surfaces is an essential visual task, yet the underlying computations for boundary segmentation remain poorly understood. In this project, we will apply classical psychophysical techniques and our novel machine learning methodology to understand how multiple cues, including luminance, texture, and color, combine to enable boundary segmentation. We hope to develop and test computational models of boundary segmentation, with the ultimate goal of gaining insight into the underlying neural mechanisms employed for this essential natural vision task.","Perceptual integration of luminance, texture and color cues for visual boundary segmentation",10201916,R15EY032732,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Color', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Discrimination', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Series', 'Side', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'computer studies', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory curriculum', 'luminance', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'undergraduate research', 'undergraduate student', 'vision science']",NEI,FLORIDA GULF COAST UNIVERSITY,R15,2021,374345
"Circuit Dynamics for encoding and remembering sequence of events Project Summary We experience the world as a continuous sequence of events, but we remember the events as segmented episodes (e.g., my sister’s wedding). During encoding, we associate a sequence of relevant events and segment deviant events. At retrieval, episodic memory utilizes the encoded associations to replay the flow of events. The encoded associations lead to remembering the sequence of events that occurred within an episode better than the flow of events across segments. The hippocampus and the prefrontal cortices (PFC) are essential parts of the neural circuit for segmenting, linking and retrieving memories of associated events. This proposal aims to identify neural dynamics in the hippocampus-PFC circuit that support encoding a naturalistic flow of events, i.e., sequences of words. We will determine the neural dynamics using intracranial encephalography (iEEG) acquired from the hippocampus and PFC of epileptic patients, who have electrodes implemented for pre-surgical seizure monitoring. Our experiment requires patients to listen to a narrative and later recall the flow of events. During the past year, I developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that quantifies the associations of words depending on the narrative context. I will use NLP model for annotation of the iEEG data to determine neural dynamics engaged during encoding sequences of words. Our research program (mainly data collection), like all other human subject research, has been significantly affected by the COVID mitigation efforts. We were not able to collect the required iEEG data to fulfill the aims of the planned K99 phase during the past year. With the vaccination of researchers and medical staff and screening of patients before the hospitalization, our data collection program is reopening with considerations. The extension to the K99 will allow us to catch up with the data collection that is required for the planned training on advanced data analysis. The central hypotheses are that bidirectional communications between the hippocampus and PFC support the encoding of sequences of events and successful subsequent memory. To address a causal relationship between hippocampal function and event segmentation, I will study speech comprehension and speech memory in developmental amnesic patients who suffer from hippocampal damage and have trouble tracking reference points in a speech. The combination of iEEG, NLP modeling, and patients’ behavioral data will provide valuable insights into the neural dynamics of effective speech encoding that predicts subsequent memory, which may inform development into therapeutic interventions. Project Narrative The ability to segment the world into meaningful episodes engages the human hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Using direct electrophysiological recording from the human brain, advanced analytical techniques, Natural Language Processing models, and the behavior of patients with hippocampal lesions, this proposal will determine the neural dynamics for efficient encoding of sequences of words that predicts successful memory formation. The findings of this proposal may help inform the development of neural prosthetics for assisting patients with memory deficits.",Circuit Dynamics for encoding and remembering sequence of events,10375038,K99MH120048,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Subject Research', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Medical Staff', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Seizures', 'Sister', 'Speech', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Vaccination', 'advanced analytics', 'coronavirus disease', 'deviant', 'encephalography', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurodevelopment', 'patient screening', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2021,78705
"Digital behavioral phenotyping and multi-region electrophysiology to determine behavioral and neural network changes underlying the stress response in mice ABSTRACT: Chronic psychological stress triggers and exacerbates major depressive disorder (MDD) and many other psychiatric conditions – causing changes in sleep, eating habits, addictive behaviors, activity levels, circadian rhythms, mood and other domains. The rodent stress response shares many behavioral and physiologic alterations with that of humans. Chronic stress also has broad effects on the brain. But major gaps exist in our knowledge in regard to the integrated behavior and physiology as well as the corresponding brain circuit changes with chronic stress. Prior work has found many behavioral and physiologic phenotypes of stress, but we lack a cohesive sense of how these variables co-evolve over time. Our first aim is to delineate this co-evolution of stress response elements in stressed versus unstressed mice. We will accomplish this by examining mice under a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm versus controls in our new naturalistic observation system the “Digital Homecage”. This system allows us to monitor over 50 behavioral measures simultaneously over weeks. Mice will live in these homecages for 8 weeks: 2 weeks baseline, 4 weeks CUS and 2 weeks of recovery. An exploratory element of that aim is to use machine learning to determine a coherent mouse stress biomarker for future quantitative studies. Our next goal is to determine electrophysiologic signatures of chronic stress. It is known that chronic stress alters brain circuit synaptic structure and neuromodulatory balance. It is known that the behavior is controlled by the electrophysiologic state of brain networks and that those networks operate both locally within regions and via coordinated multi-regional transmission. Therefore, we aim to study changes in electrophysiology both within and across regions. We focus on the medial prefrontal cortex, the ventral hippocampus and infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex given their strong involvement in chronic stress. We will implant tetrode arrays into these regions and will record over 8 weeks as above. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of chronic stress on within-region spiking tendencies including spike rate variability and excitatory- inhibitory balance. In a second part of this aim we will use machine learning applied to a wider variety of within- region dynamical measures to determine a potentially more complete set of differences between CUS and control mice. In our final Aim, we will assess cross-regional coordination between these 3 regions. We will test the hypothesis that pairwise coupling between regions will be altered in a manner consistent with MDD by measuring coupling using both spiking and LFP. Again, we will then use machine learning methods on our large dataset to detect further inter-regional dynamics un-revealed in our hypothesis-driven testing. This mixture of behavior and electrophysiology is done to generate new understanding about chronic stress. We also have a long-term vision of creating large dataset for future analysis, a fully-refined Digital Homecage system for future studies, with an eye towards developing interventions based on natural electrophysiologic circuit function. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stress has a central role in mental health conditions and improved understanding of how stress affects brain and body could deliver great potential clinical impact. To determine the brain and body responses to varying stressors we will use novel instrumentation to measure 50+ behavioral metrics at sub-second resolution together with multi-brain site electrophysiology over weeks. We will then determine how varying stressors affect circadian and broader changes across animal behavior and physiology as well as neural circuit dynamics.",Digital behavioral phenotyping and multi-region electrophysiology to determine behavioral and neural network changes underlying the stress response in mice,10199475,R01MH126137,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Behavior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Body Temperature', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diet Habits', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intervention', 'Ketamine', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychological Stress', 'REM Sleep', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Solid', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Sucrose', 'Suggestion', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'circadian', 'cohesion', 'data structure', 'digital', 'field study', 'forced swim test', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stressor', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,681455
"Dense Analysis of Cortical Circuit Dysfunction in the MECP2-duplication Syndrome of Autism Multiple hypotheses have been put forward regarding cortical circuit dysfunction in autism, including: excitation to inhibition (E/I) imbalance, hyper- or hypo- connectivity profiles, abnormal processing along the cortical column, increased variability of sensory encoding, failure of “canonical” cortical computations, and others. Nevertheless, we currently lack a detailed mechanistic understanding of how cortical circuits malfunction during sensory processing in autism. This critical knowledge deficit needs to be corrected. Identifying common themes of neural circuit dysfunction in autism would yield new targets for intervention, potentially opening new windows for restoring function. Methyl-CpG-binding-protein-2 (MECP2) duplication syndrome is caused by duplication of the MECP2 gene, leading to progressive intellectual disability and autism in males with 100% penetrance. It is the “mirror image” of Rett syndrome, caused by loss of MECP2 function. Abnormal synaptic plasticity and E/I imbalance have been causally implicated in both MECP2-disorders and autism in general and are known to affect cortical function. Notably, we and others have shown that visual function is abnormal in MECP2-syndromes. Visual cortex, a prototypical “low level” sensory area, renders itself optimally for studying cortical sensory processing. Here, we mount a comprehensive effort to understand how sensory processing fails in MECP2-duplication syndrome, by studying the visual cortex. Recent advances will allow us for the first time to map densely, at single cell resolution, the functional properties and connectome of a cortical column, one of the fundamental modules of cortical computation, in the MECP2-duplication mouse model of autism (aim #1). This will be followed by a detailed electro-physiological connectivity analysis of the cortical circuit to probe underlying mechanisms (aim #2). Data obtained will be used in conjunction with deep learning techniques to create a sophisticated neuro-realistic model of the cortical circuit, which will allow a detailed, “in computo,” interrogation of the mechanism of dysfunction and how to ameliorate it (aim #3). Hypotheses formulated “in computo” can then be tested optogenetically, closing the loop. Expectations: 1) Obtain the first comprehensive picture of how early sensory processing fails in this model of autism. 2) Identify specific sub-network connectivity defects reflecting abnormal interneuronal connectivity and E/I balance, 3) Construct a neuro-realistic model of the cortical microcircuit, which can be used to uncover “in computo” the mechanism of dysfunction and to probe how one might intervene to repair it. Finally, we will 4) develop a systematic framework, within which to categorize cortical processing and dysfunction in autism. In the future, additional models of autism will be brought into this fold to be categorized and systematically studied. Multiple hypotheses have been put forward regarding cortical circuit dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders. Nevertheless, we currently lack a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how cortical circuits malfunction during sensory processing in autism. Here we undertake an effort to densely map cortical circuit properties and connectivity in the MECP2-duplication syndrome of autism and use this information to create a neuro-realistic cortical circuit model, which will allow a detailed, “in computo,” interrogation of the mechanism of dysfunction and how to ameliorate it. 1",Dense Analysis of Cortical Circuit Dysfunction in the MECP2-duplication Syndrome of Autism,10121643,R01NS113890,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Cortical Column', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'MeCP2 Duplication Syndrome', 'Methods', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Sensory', 'Slice', 'Stimulus', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'area V1', 'area striata', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'deep learning', 'design', 'excitatory neuron', 'expectation', 'functional restoration', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'repaired', 'therapeutic target', 'two-photon', 'visual processing']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,694774
"An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms An intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) is used to record electrical signals directly from a person's brain, predict their intention from those signals, then control an assistive device (e.g., a computer cursor, prosthetic limb, or powered wheelchair) according to those intentions. This technology enables severely paralyzed people to interact with the world. However, designing robust algorithms to extract intent from recordings of single neurons is extremely challenging, in large part because of the very limited access to humans, or even monkeys, from whom these invasive recordings can be made. In this project, we will develop a model iBCI system that generates real-time biomimetic neural data by capturing the high-degree-of-freedom finger movements of able-bodied human subjects. To accomplish this, we will construct a modular recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN will be trained to predict the motor cortex activity of a monkey from the monkey's own finger kinematics. Small modules of the RNN will be interchanged according the particular animal or recording session to model the high inter-session variability present in motor cortex. Once the modular RNN is trained, its weights will be fixed and human finger kinematics will be used as the RNN inputs, which will generate subject-controlled emulated neural activity. The emulated neural activity can be passed to iBCI decoding algorithms that control computer cursors or other physical devices, allowing human subjects to interact directly with decoders in real time, closed-loop conditions. We call this model system the jaBCI. The jaBCI is low cost and noninvasive, making it possible to rapidly test and design novel iBCI decoders using statistically rigorous sample sizes. The project will be executed in close collaboration with intracortical microelectrode array data expert Dr. Lee Miller at Northwestern University. Dr. Miller's lab, with the help of our consultant Dr. Mathis, will obtain simultaneous finger kinematics and neural activity of monkey subjects that will serve as the training data for the RNN component of the iBCI model. We will validate the emulated neural data generated by the jaBCI across many measures to ensure the model captures as many features of intracortical data as possible. These include comparing the model and actual iBCI in subject performance, learning rates, control strategies, neural variation across days, neural firing rate distributions, and low-dimensional neural dynamics. With the validated model, we will undertake a study to rigorously evaluate the highest performing, current state-of-the-art iBCI decoders. This will yield useful insight into the features of decoders that yield the greatest performance gains, overcoming the current impossibility to compare iBCI decoders in well-controlled studies using more than two or three naïve human subjects. We will also use the iBCI model to evaluate novel decoder designs, and to determine the features of neural dynamics that are consistent across common iBCI tasks to help focus decoder development on those features. Narrative Brain-computer interfaces are systems that translate the electrical neural signatures of thought into instructions for a personal computer or powered wheelchair, which is an incredibly useful technology to help paralyzed people regain some independence and ability to communicate. This work would develop a tool that scientists can use to design, test, and optimize the sophisticated computer programs that translate brain signals into device instructions without having to implant electrodes into a person's brain until the program is completed and rigorously tested. This tool could increase the pace of discovery and development of brain-computer interfaces.",An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms,10183350,R01NS109257,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biological Models', 'Biomimetics', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Finger joint structure', 'Fingers', 'Freedom', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Industry Standard', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operating System', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Personal Power', 'Persons', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Robotics', 'Rotation', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'brain computer interface', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer program', 'cost', 'design', 'finger movement', 'head-to-head comparison', 'high dimensionality', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'innovation', 'insight', 'invention', 'kinematics', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'skill acquisition', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,334572
"Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies   Project Summary Decades of psychology research have shown that working memory is limited, and humans can only hold a few items in mind at the same time. However, cognitive tasks like planning and problem solving require access to many pieces of information at once. To overcome this constraint, we enlist mnemonic strategies, for instance grouping pieces of information into chunks, as we commonly do to remember telephone or social security numbers. Mnemonic chunking allows us to flexibly organize information on line, providing a fundamental building block for advanced cognitive abilities. Chunking impairments occur when damage or dysfunction involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), for instance in patients with schizophrenia, and severely compromises overall cognitive function. Thus, determining how the brain organizes information is a necessary step toward understanding the mechanisms of advanced cognition, and how these go awry in disease states. A key challenge is that strategies for organizing information are self-generated and highly variable in a laboratory setting. A central innovation of this proposal is the novel computational approach used to identify spontaneous mnemonic chunking in macaque monkeys. This is critical because animal models allow us to interrogate brain function with advanced neurophysiological tools. Here, we will use high-density, multi-site recording and targeted neuromodulation to understand the circuit mechanisms that chunk mnemonic information. Previous theoretical work suggests that chunks arise from compressed working memory representations that act as neural shorthand, economizing on processing resources at the cost of degrading some original information. Neurons in dlPFC encode items in working memory, and their dynamics are shaped by recurrent interactions with the basal ganglia. Thus, we hypothesize that corticostriatal interactions promote the efficient reorganization of working memory that underlies chunking. To test this we will investigate dlPFC- striatal dynamics when monkeys spontaneously chunk information in a self-organized working memory task. We will record large numbers of single neurons and local field potentials, and dynamically decode representations held in working memory to assess how mnemonic codes and corticostriatal interactions change when items are or are not chunked. In addition, exogenous stimulation will test the causal role of striatal circuits in promoting the formation of mnemonic chunks. Together, these experiments will determine how the brain establishes mnemonic chunks to optimize working memory performance. This will shed light on a fundamental feature of advanced cognition, and how dysfunction in these mechanisms could give rise to disorders of thought and memory. Finally, understanding mechanisms that optimize cognitive function in a biological system may fuel creative advances that optimize performance in artificial intelligence systems.   Project Narrative This project focuses on understanding circuit dynamics in the prefrontal cortex that mediate mnemonic chunking, a critical strategy for improving working memory performance in advanced cognition. Specifically, we will assess how mnemonic information is bound together in the dynamics of frontal and striatal circuits, and whether these processes can be enhanced with targeted circuit modulation. Our results could provide insights into core deficits in cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia, and open the door for novel approaches that enhance cognitive function in the setting of working memory deficits.",Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies,10098347,R01MH121480,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Security Number', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Work', 'behavior test', 'biological systems', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'density', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'memory recall', 'microstimulation', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,460527
"Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation Project Summary This project’s long-term goal is a fuller understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of olfactory sensory adaptation that facilitate odor discrimination in the natural world. To confront the wide fluctuations in intensity and temporal variability that are characteristic of natural odor environments, animals have evolved refined neurosensory mechanisms for parsing behaviorally-relevant signals such as pheromones from background nuisance odors. This project seeks to elucidate how adaptive mechanisms in the olfactory periphery play a central role in this discrimination task. The project will utilize a novel behavioral assay that permits precise quantification of the logic used by insects in navigating complex, temporally dynamic odor environments. By combining this assay with data analytic methods and machine learning, a comprehensive lexicon of archetypal navigational strategies of insect odor navigation will be derived. Importantly, since both odors and insects can be simultaneously tracked in this assay, the project will uncover strategies employed by insects in not just static, but also fluctuating odor landscapes. By quantifying how these strategies modulate in time, the role of memory in shaping navigational strategies will also be determined. The project will then leverage this dictionary of navigational logic to quantify how various mechanisms of adaptation in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons can shape odor discrimination. Importantly, this project will examine the role of olfactory sensory adaptation in an ethologically-relevant way, by connecting mechanisms that operate at the level of sensory input with neural computations that affect output behavior. Further, since the behavioral assay tracks complex odor environments simultaneous with freely-moving insects, the impact of behavior on future signal acquisition – behavioral feedback onto odor stimuli – is fully maintained. The behavioral experiments and data analysis in this project utilize the tractable, highly-characterized system of Drosophila melanogaster, in which a wealth of existing genetic tools will allow directed experimentation of specific adaptive mechanisms in olfaction. The results of this project will elucidate how insects effectively navigate complex odor environments, and how olfactory systems maintain sensitivity despite odor conflicts and temporal variability. Project Narrative This project will contribute to our understanding of how the olfactory sensory periphery and neural circuitry have evolved to effectively encode our vast and varied chemical environment. The project will help reveal how odor discrimination capability is maintained in natural odor landscapes, leading to practical interventional strategies for the control of disease vectors such as tsetse flies and mosquitos, who rely critically on their sense of smell to navigate. Chemical sensing is the only shared sensation among organisms as simple as bacteria and as complex as humans, and this project will enhance our fundamental knowledge of this universal sensory modality.",Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation,10105369,F32MH118700,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Culicidae', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Dictionary', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Vectors', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Insecta', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Left', 'Logic', 'Lymph', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pheromone', 'Photosensitivity', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tsetse Flies', 'Walking', 'analytical method', 'disorder control', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'light intensity', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurosensory', 'novel', 'odorant-binding protein', 'optogenetics', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,73562
"Decoding the dynamic representation of reward predictions across mesocorticostriatal circuits during learning Reward learning is a fundamental cognitive function, and the brain has a dedicated neuromodulatory system – based on dopamine – that supports this process. Changes to the dopamine system that are triggered by exposure to drugs of abuse are thought to underlie the behavioral changes observed in addiction. Here we propose to use a treasure trove of previously recorded neural data from throughout the mesocorticostriatal circuitry that supports reward learning, to elucidate the computational role of each component of the circuit, their interactions, and how these components are affected by cocaine. Our brains constantly generate predictions about what rewards might be available, and compare these predictions to actual outcomes. The neuromodulator dopamine is thought to report these ‘prediction error’ signals, the result of the ongoing comparison between expected and obtained rewards, that are key to updating predictions so they are more accurate in the future. Predicting the timing of rewards, and not just their identity or value, is an important component of this process, but it remains a mystery how the brain forms and uses predictions about time in reward learning. Based on a novel theoretical model we recently developed, we will test the computational role of three key brain areas that comprise the brain circuit critical for reward learning, using a state-of-the- art methods from machine learning to jointly decode the learning processes that drive neural activity from multiple brain areas along with behavior as rats perform a reward learning task. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex is uniquely important for representing high level ‘task states’ and will test for patterns in OFC neural activity that follow the hidden structure of the task. In Aim 2, we will decode the representation of reward predictions about the amount and timing of rewards, and test whether they are separable in VS neural activity. In Aim 3, we will test how activity in VS and OFC controls dopamine activity, and in particular how each input component enables prediction errors to be temporally precise. In Aim 4, we will test how exposure to cocaine changes neural activity that represents reward predictions in the VS, and the impact of this disruption on dopamine prediction errors in the VTA. This innovative multi-level study will leverage numerous existing neural and behavioral data from rats performing a well-validated reward-learning task, to reveal the computational, neural and behavioral mechanisms of the reward prediction and learning circuitry in the brain, and the source of their disruption in addiction. Dysfunction of mesolimbic and corticostriatal circuitry is implicated in addiction, and is known to produce critical deficits in timing (for example, impulsivity) and reward learning. Here we will use a treasure trove of 8 existing datasets to test novel predictions about the neural basis of timing and reward learning, employing state-of-the-art tools from machine learning to ‘decode’ reward predictions jointly from multiple brain areas and from behavior, in intact neural circuits as well as after damage from lesions or exposure to cocaine. Our findings will lay bare the neural computations that support reward prediction and will allow us to link aberrant reward learning in addiction back to its basis in the circuitry of the brain.",Decoding the dynamic representation of reward predictions across mesocorticostriatal circuits during learning,10153745,R01DA050647,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'Cocaine', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'International', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Update', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive function', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'dopamine system', 'drug of abuse', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward circuitry', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,283500
"Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Selective attention is an essential cognitive ability that permits us to effectively process and act upon relevant information while ignoring distracting events. A network involving frontal and parietal cortex for top-down attentional control, referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), is active during both spatial and non- spatial (feature-based) attention. However, we know very little about the fine structure of attentional control activity in the DAN, how this structure changes to represent different to-be-attended stimulus features, how the connectivity within the DAN, and between the DAN and sensory cortex shifts when attending different features, or how these top-down processes and their influence in sensory cortex unfold over time. This gap in our knowledge is a critical problem for our models and theories of attention, and because attentional deficits are involved in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The working model guiding this research is that top-down attentional control, based on different to-be-attended stimulus attributes, is guided by a smaller-scale neural fine structure within the DAN and prefrontal cortex that makes specific connections with specialized areas of visual cortex coding the attended attributes. Moreover, the time course of activity within the DAN in relation to that in sensory cortex follows a top-down cascading model, being earliest in frontal, then parietal cortex, and finally sensory cortex for preparatory, voluntary, attentional control. To identify the functional networks for attentional control for different forms of attention, and to define their time courses, this project uses innovative simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Advanced signal processing and modeling, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), graph theoretic connectivity analysis, and Granger causality analysis will be used to reveal the fine functional anatomy and time course of attentional control and selection. The project includes three experiments that vary the to-be-attended stimulus attributes from spatial location to stimulus features (color and motion), and pursues three aims. Aim 1 is to reveal the fine structure of top-down preparatory attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus features. Aim 2 is to elucidate the specific connectivity between fine structures for preparatory attentional control in the DAN and their target sensory structures in sensory cortex. Aim 3 is to reveal the time course of top-down attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus attributes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The capacity to focus attention is at the core of human mental functioning, and therefore, elucidating the neural bases of attention remains a central challenge for neuroscience, representing an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia.",Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning,10115818,R01MH117991,"['Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Color', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Discrimination', 'Dorsal', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'data integration', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mental function', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective attention', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,530307
"Neurophysiologically-informed Design of Flexible, 2-learner Brain-Machine Interfaces for Robust and Skillful Performance PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to elucidate the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing. The outcome of the proposed work has the potential to guide the development of the next generation of neurophysiologically-informed, cortically-controlled neuroprosthetic systems for patients with neurological disorders. State-of-the-art brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage machine learning to rapidly calibrate to the neural activity of individuals, but performance also benefits from subjects learning to reliably produce desired neural activity patterns. The basic science and engineering principles of designing such a “2-learner BMI” in which the brain and machine synergistically learn are not well understood. Hence, this proposal aims to investigate how the brain learns when the machine undergoes different degrees of learning, how different degrees of brain learning affect long-term BMI performance, robustness, and generalization, and how these principles can guide the design of a 2-learner BMI system which facilitates brain learning. The proposal is structured in three aims: 1) To study the impact of decoder adaptation on the development of neural encoding models underlying neuroprosthetic skill; 2) To Study how decoder adaptation and resultant neural encoding model influences BMI performance with perturbations (robustness) and BMI performance on unpracticed tasks (generalization); and 3) Design and validation of the next-generation Flexible 2-Learner Decoder architecture. The analyses and experiments proposed in these aims will leverage the fundamental knowledge gained about how the brain learns and acquires neuroprosthetic skills into the neurophysiologically-informed design of robust and high-performance closed-loop motor neuroprosthetics that generalize to new tasks.

"Neural mechanisms of active vision in the fovea Neural mechanisms of active vision in the fovea In many ways human vision is like a camera, with a lens that forms an image on a spatially arranged sensor (the retina). However, it is unlike a camera because the sensor has uneven sampling and is constantly moving with the eyes. Recent behavioral and theoretical work suggest these eye movements serve a faciliatory role in high acuity vision – where the eye movements are part of the computations and enhance spatial resolution. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms to support this facilitation remain unknown. More broadly, little is known about the neural mechanisms that integrate across the retinal motion generated by eye movements, especially in the central visual field (the fovea). This is particularly important because over 8 million Americans suffer from central vision loss due to retinal disorders. Even if the retinal signals could be repaired, it is imperative to understand how the brain reads out foveal signals to ensure recovery of high-acuity visual processing, and fixational eye movements are a part of that process. The proposed career development plan aims to address these questions by measuring visual processing in the foveal representation of primary visual cortex (V1) during natural visual behavior. This proposal uses custom high-resolution eye-tracking, a novel visual foraging paradigm, largescale neurophysiology, and state-of-the-art machine learning to make these measurements possible. The proposed research will not only generate fundamental understanding of how eye-movements facilitate visual processing, but also will integrate the experimental and theoretical tools required to support neurophysiological studies of active visual processing without a loss of rigor or detail. The candidate has extensive expertise in awake- behaving neurophysiology and computational modeling and the training plan is designed to support his further training in statistical modeling, high-resolution eye-tracking, and modern machine-learning techniques for analyzing neural population data. The primary mentor, Dr. Daniel Butts, is a world expert in statistical models of neural activity during active vision; Co-mentor, Dr. Michele Rucci, is a world leader in high-resolution eye tracking and theoretical approaches to active vision; and Co-mentor, Dr. Jude Mitchell, is a pioneer in establishing the marmoset model of visual neuroscience and an expert in neurophysiology of visual attention. Together, they will provide the guidance to establish the candidate’s transition to a successful independent research career. The goal of this proposal is to identify the impact of fixational eye movements on neural representations in visual cortex in the central visual field. Over 9 million Americans have central vision loss from age-related macular degeneration.

"Motor Modulation of Auditory Processing Project Summary Vocal communication depends on distinguishing our own vocal sounds (vocal feedback) from other sounds. Vocal motor-related corollary discharge (vocal CD) signals that suppress auditory responses to predictable vocal feedback help make this distinction. Notably, vocal CD signals in the human auditory cortex are especially important to speech and their dysfunction is thought to cause auditory hallucinations. Despite the key roles postulated for vocal CD signals, the challenges of monitoring and manipulating their activity in vocalizing animals has prevented systematic analyses. The long-term objective of this application is to understand with synaptic, cellular, and circuit resolution how vocal CD signals modulate auditory cortical responses to vocal feedback, detailed knowledge of which is essential to understand adaptive and maladaptive aspects of audition. We will gain detailed knowledge of synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms underlying this process by studying the mouse, the vertebrate most suited to advanced genetic, electrophysiological, and optical tools. In the prior funding period, we used these tools to advance our understanding the synaptic and circuit mechanisms by which movement-related CD signals modulate auditory cortical activity. These advances included mapping a motor to auditory cortical circuit, determining that various head and body movements activate this pathway to suppress auditory cortical responses to sounds, and showing that this pathway can “learn” to selectively suppress sounds that are predictably yoked to locomotor movements. We also observed auditory cortical suppression in vocalizing male mice, but vocalization occurred during female courtship and was always accompanied by other movements, as well as by social and sexual stimuli. Therefore, whether vocalization-specific CD signals modulate the auditory cortex and suppress predictable vocal feedback remain unknown. Fortunately, we also developed methods for optogenetically gating ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and for distorting vocal feedback in the isolated, head-fixed mouse. Here we propose to combine these methods with other state of the art techniques, including multi-electrode arrays, in vivo multiphoton imaging, controlled manipulation of vocalization-related auditory feedback, and novel computational methods for voco-acoustic analysis. In the first Aim, we will test the idea that vocalization suppresses auditory cortical activity and use machine learning methods to rigorously quantify and compare spontaneous and optogenetically-evoked USVs. In the second Aim, we will isolate cortical contributions to the vocal modulation of auditory cortical activity. In the third Aim, we will distort vocal feedback to determine if vocal suppression of the auditory cortex is predictive, and use computational methods to systematically quantify vocal distortion. Together, these Aims will provide novel insights into the synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms by which vocal CD signals influence auditory cortical processing. Project Narrative Normal hearing depends on the brain’s ability to anticipate and suppress responses to self-generated vocal sounds, while impaired suppression generates auditory hallucinations. We aim to show how vocal motor signals suppress auditory activity in the brain, thus informing how hearing works in health and disease.",Motor Modulation of Auditory Processing,10121250,R01DC013826,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Hallucination', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bone Conduction', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Courtship', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Optical Methods', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ultrasonics', 'Variant', 'Work', 'auditory feedback', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'autoencoder', 'deaf', 'excitatory neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'multiphoton imaging', 'neural circuit', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'response', 'social', 'sound', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'unsupervised learning', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,429899
"Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits Behaviors such as action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging due to the involvement of multiple brain areas and due to the fact that such behaviors involve multiple timescales, from the granular level of moment-to-moment limb control to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. Modern experiments, which are able to record from large numbers of neurons in behaving animals, and in some cases to do so simultaneously in multiple brain areas and throughout the learning of a task, are providing a path forward for addressing these challenges. The overall goal of my research is to facilitate the synthesis and understanding of data from such experiments by constructing models of the brain circuits relevant for a given behavior, addressing how the neural activity in these circuits relates to behavior and how it is shaped over time through learning. In recent work, I have developed expertise in learned dynamics in neural circuits through three related lines of research. First, I have modeled the neural computations underlying timing-related behavior and its implementation in the basal ganglia. Second, I have mathematically derived biologically plausible learning rules to underlie supervised learning of time-dependent tasks in recurrent neural networks. Finally, I have worked on a theory-experiment collaboration in which modeling with recurrent neural networks was used in tandem with brain-machine interface experiments in monkeys to address the structure of neural representations within primary motor cortex. In future work, I will build on this experience to address how dynamical neural activity patterns are learned in order to produce complex behaviors over both short and long timescales. One way to begin addressing this question is with the theory of reinforcement learning, which provides a rich and powerful framework for addressing how actions should be performed in order to maximize future rewards. Given their established role in implementing reinforcement learning, the basal ganglia form the starting point for my proposed research program. I first aim to revise the classical model of basal ganglia function by constructing and mathematically analyzing models that solve computationally challenging tasks and by comparing the results with new data from my experimental collaborators (Aim 1). Building on this work, and making use of my prior experience training recurrent neural networks to model motor tasks, I will next consider learning in motor cortex and how it complements learning in basal ganglia (Aim 2), again comparing models with new experimental data. Finally, I will construct models of the thalamocortico-basal ganglia circuit by incorporating knowledge about the neural representations throughout this circuit and by leveraging recent advances in machine learning. In this way I will address how the mammalian brain implements hierarchical reinforcement learning to integrate behaviors over short and long timescales (Aim 3). Taken together, this research will advance understanding of how neural activity facilitates action selection and sequencing in complex behaviors. Behaviors involving action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging because multiple brain areas are involved and because such behaviors may involve multiple timescales, from low-level limb movements to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. By developing circuit models of the basal ganglia and their cortical inputs, using new data from my experimental collaborators to inform and test these models, and drawing on recent advances in reinforcement learning from the field of machine learning, I will advance the understanding of how learned motor behaviors are implemented in the brain.",Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits,10296960,R00NS114194,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Dopamine', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'limb movement', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'motor behavior', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'supervised learning', 'theories']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R00,2021,249000
"Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Project Summary: Considerable evidence exists to support the notion that amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology impair neuronal circuit integrity and function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Unfortunately, few studies have tested the direct influence of AD pathology on spatial computation within affected neuronal populations, resulting in an information gap at the neuronal network level. Moreover, in vivo experiments that examine large scale, neuronal network activity in mouse models of Aβ and tau pathology are lacking. In this proposal, I test the overarching hypothesis that Aβ and tau associated neuronal network dysfunction impairs task-relevant, spatial information encoding in large populations of neurons within the EC-HIPP circuit, and that combating this aberrant activity can restore order and improve spatial information processing in AD mice. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that oligomeric forms of Aβ and tau disturb spatial information content encoded within large populations of neurons in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit. I will also test if these oligomeric peptides alter the number of neurons recruited into the population code responsible for memory encoding in a spatial learning and memory task. In Aims 2 & 3, I will leverage the predictive power of machine learning to decipher the neural code for spatial information processing in EC-HIPP population activity. Specifically, my goals in Aim 2 will be to examine the individual and combined impact of Aβ and tau pathologies on features of spatial information encoding in the EC-Tau/hAPP mouse line. In Aim 3, I will employ chemogenetics using a novel DREADDs ligand to combat aberrant neuronal activity in AD mouse models, with the ultimate goal of improving spatial information processing in neuronal networks burdened with pathology. Excitatory neurons will be specifically targeted in an effort to better understand their contribution to impaired spatial information processing in AD mouse models.  The proposed research aims are designed to bridge an information gap between AD-related cognitive impairment and the underlying circuit pathology. This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award will afford me the opportunity to accomplish this major goal while enriching my technical skillset and expanding my knowledge of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the integrated training and mentorship that I will receive will help me develop additional expertise in machine learning for spatial decoding analyses. Together, the proposed studies and career development plan will ensure that I achieve my long-term career goal of launching a competitive, independent research career at a major research university. Project Narrative The progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with dysfunctional neuronal signaling and poor cognitive performance. In this proposal, newly developed machine learning strategies will be used to decode features of task-relevant, spatial information from neural ensemble activity in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit of transgenic mice expressing Aβ and tau pathology, with the overarching goal of understanding how Aβ and tau interfere with spatial information encoded within neuronal networks. Dysfunctional neuronal populations will then be selectively targeted using chemogenetics to correct their aberrant firing patterns, with the aim of improving the quality of spatial information carried by pathology afflicted neuronal networks.",Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice,10237353,K01AG068598,"['4-Hydroxy-Tamoxifen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'J20 mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'abeta accumulation', 'attenuation', 'awake', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive performance', 'combat', 'design', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'entorhinal cortex', 'excitatory neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'learning strategy', 'memory encoding', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatial memory', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2021,106388
