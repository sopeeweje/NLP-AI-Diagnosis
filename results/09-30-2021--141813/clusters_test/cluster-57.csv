"Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The information content of DNA is not limited to the primary sequence (A, C, G, T), but is also conveyed by chemical modifications of individual bases. For example, DNA methylation, specifically 5-methylcytosine (5mC), has been widely studied for its important regulatory roles in human development and diseases. In addition, the discovery of active demethylation of 5mC, mediated by TET enzymes, into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) revealed great insights into the dynamic nature of the human methylome and its close relevance to multiple human diseases. Beyond these chemical modifications to cytosine, recent studies by us and others discovered that N6-methyladenine (6mA), another form of methylation previously thought exclusively existing in bacteria and protozoa, also exists in eukaryotic genomes including the human genome. In addition to these epigenetic marks, different forms of DNA damages represent another category of DNA chemical modifications that are of important biological relevance. Although a few methods for mapping individual chemical modifications have been developed and some are widely used, it is usually hard for broad researchers to master every protocol to map each form of modification. While third- generation sequencing technologies support the direct detection of DNA modifications, they face fundamental challenges distinguishing among different forms of modifications. The objective of this project is to develop a novel technology for the direct mapping of multiple forms of DNA methylation and DNA damage events simultaneously. The core idea is that each form of nucleic acid modification has a unique signature in terms of their physical interaction with DNA polymerase, or nanopores in third-generation sequencing; and these signatures can be modeled by deep learning methods. We will develop this technology using multiple innovative strategies to address a few fundamental challenges, and then comprehensively evaluate the technology to facilitate broad applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chemical DNA modifications are crucial components of human genome that controls many important biological processes in human development and human diseases. In this project, we will develop a novel technology for direct mapping of multiple and specific forms of DNA modifications, which will enable us and a large number of researchers to more effectively study the functions of DNA modifications in human genome.",Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome,10204438,R01HG011095,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Performance', 'Ploidies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protozoa', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Technology', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cancer risk', 'cell type', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'demethylation', 'exome', 'experience', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'methylome', 'nanopore', 'network models', 'new technology', 'prototype', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,833051
"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms. Novel mechanistic insights of diseases at the regulatory and molecular level will facilitate improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for human diseases.",Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular,10172932,R01GM131398,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,325001
"Resolving single-cell brain regulatory elements with bulk data supervised models Gene regulation is an important determinant of the complex specialization of cells in the human brain, and nucleotide changes within regulatory elements contribute to risk for psychiatric disorders. We therefore hypothesize that these debilitating diseases are driven in part by genetic variants that alter gene expression and disturb the balance and function of cell types in brain tissue. Single-cell open chromatin assays are a promising approach to testing this hypothesis by mapping variants to regulatory elements specific to and shared across cell populations. There are two major barriers to this strategy, for which our project proposes modeling solutions. First, despite being the best assay currently, single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) suffers from low resolution, meaning that an open chromatin region may be supported by zero or few reads in a given cell. This makes it hard to identify coherent cell populations. We propose a network model for semi-supervised clustering of cells in scATAC-seq that leverages information from higher-coverage bulk tissue experiments and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), if available. The expected outcomes from applying this model to compendia of brain data from public repositories and our collaborators are (i) identification of open chromatin regions that differentiate cell types and states, and (ii) discovery of resolved cell populations whose open chromatin is enriched for psychiatric disorder associated genetic variants. These results alone may not be enough to develop a mechanistic understanding of how variants impact brain function. To address this second challenge, we will implement a computationally efficient, machine-learning framework for predicting the specific regulatory functions of single-cell open chromatin regions from our network model and other approaches. Gene regulatory enhancers are particularly amenable to this approach, because high-throughput mouse transgenics and massively parallel reporter assays have generated enough validated enhancers for supervised learning. Our framework will be easy to apply to other regulatory functions, such as insulating boundaries in chromatin capture data. By developing a compressed, yet flexible, featurization of massive bulk and single-cell data compendia, we will enable rapid iteration with computationally intensive prediction algorithms to be applied to single-cell open chromatin regions. Our approach will also incorporate transfer learning from data-rich (e.g., postmortem or mouse brains) to data-poor settings (e.g., human late-gestation brains). We expect predicted regulatory elements to be more enriched for psychiatric disorder genetic risk, to provide mechanistic insight regarding how variants cause disease, and to be useful molecular tools. Together our two proposed computational approaches will leverage the complementary strengths of bulk and single-cell data to resolve regulatory elements that drive the exquisite diversity of cells in developing and adult brains towards mapping the non-coding contribution of psychiatric disease. The human brain is a complex tissue comprised of diverse cell types with distinct gene regulation and function, making it difficult to mechanistically link genetic mutations to differences in brain health. This project will develop a network model and machine-learning framework that leverage single-cell and bulk genomics data to identify genome sequences that control gene expression in specific cell populations and states. We hypothesize that these cell type resolved regulatory elements will shed light on how sequence variants outside protein-coding genes increase risk for psychiatric disorders.",Resolving single-cell brain regulatory elements with bulk data supervised models,10144503,R01MH123178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Censuses', 'Chickens', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neuraxis', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'XCL1 gene', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'egg', 'epigenomics', 'equilibration disorder', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'multiple data types', 'network models', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'promoter', 'psychiatric genomics', 'public repository', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'web server', 'whole genome']",NIMH,J.

"Nuclear Organization and Function PROJECT SUMMARY. Proper regulation of gene expression is essential for cell differentiation and homeostasis. Most of our understanding of the mechanisms that control the transcription process comes from studies of the one-dimensional genome i.e. the 10 nm chromatin fiber. However, the genome is folded in the three-dimensional (3D) nuclear space, and the relationship between this organization and gene expression is poorly understood. Using Drosophila as a model system, where it is feasible to obtain 250 bp resolution Hi-C data, we have found that the genome is folded into only one type of domain, which we call compartmental domains. These domains precisely correlate with the transcriptional state of their sequences. Compartmental domains are also found in other lower eukaryotes. Based on this, we propose that compartmental domains represent an evolutionarily conserved principle of genome 3D organization. Drosophila and lower eukaryotes either lack CTCF or this protein is unable to stop cohesin extrusion. However, CTCF can interfere with the progression of cohesin extrusion in vertebrates, which in turn affects other types of interactions in the genome. Here we suggest extending concepts learned from the analysis of 3D organization in Drosophila to mammals by proposing an ambitious and substantive multi-disciplinary approach combining genetics, epigenomics, computational biology, and differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) into disease-relevant tissues. The hypothesis underlying the proposed experiments is based on the idea that, rather than the prevalent view of large compartments containing smaller TADs, the mammalian genome is organized by conserved principles into relatively small compartmental domains. Cohesin extrusion operates on top of the compartmental domain scaffold and affects its organization. To test this novel hypothesis, we will deplete specific proteins present in complexes required for various aspects of the transcription process. We will also deplete protein complexes responsible for H3K27me3- and H3K9me3-dependent silencing. We will then use Micro-C XL to obtain very high-resolution interaction data and examine effects of protein depletion on the formation of self-interacting domains and in the interactions between these domains. These effects will be examined in the presence and absence of cohesin in order to understand the contribution of loop extrusion to enhancer-promoter interaction frequency. We will examine the predictability of 3D genome organization from one-dimensional epigenetic information using machine learning computational tools. We will study the logic of CTCF loop formation by analyzing the local chromatin environment around CTCF sites able or unable to form loops of different strengths using a new computational tool we have developed. Principles learned from these experiments will be tested by analyzing changes in 3D organization and their relationship to gene expression during the differentiation of hESCs into pancreatic cells. Results from this work will fill critical gaps in our understanding of the relationship between 3D chromatin organization and transcription, and its possible role in human disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will analyze the mechanisms by which the three-dimensional organization of the genetic material in the nucleus is established and maintained. This organization is critical for the regulation of gene expression, and the results will be important to understand how transcription is controlled during stem cell differentiation or during reprograming of somatic cells. This knowledge will be essential to understand the basic biology of the cell nucleus and the origin of human genetic disease or cancer and could help guide the use of stem cell therapy to treat human diseases.",Nuclear Organization and Function,10083368,R35GM139408,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryota', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Hi-C', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Genetics', 'Knowledge', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Nuclear', 'Pancreas', 'Proteins', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Process', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mammalian genome', 'novel', 'promoter', 'protein complex', 'scaffold', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell therapy']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,431097
"Pan-disease characterization of DNA methylation dysregulation DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark with a regulated pattern in healthy tissues. Disruption of this pattern, called methylation dysregulation, has been reported in many diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases, metabolic and psychological disorders, and diseases related to aging. Importantly, methylation dysregulation has been observed in pre-disease states and the degree of dysregulation correlates with disease severity and also response to treatment. These observations compel the study of methylation dysregulation because it may reveal common origins of human disease, and because genomic elements (e.g. genes, mutations, and regulatory features) associated with methylation dysregulation may be potential targets for diagnostic and early intervention therapies. However, the genomic elements that control and maintain methylation dysregulation have not been well-characterized. Understanding the mechanisms and pathways that are responsible for the establishment of epigenetic dysregulation is critical for understanding the establishment of the disease phenotype in general. We hypothesize that specific genomic elements could contribute to methylation dysregulation in reproducible ways across diseases. This research seeks to identify genomic elements that may initiate a disease state that is common across multiple diseases. This will be accomplished by the development of computational algorithms to leverage and integrate patient samples from many diseases, as well as the development of a new high-throughput genomic screen. Specifically, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Identification of genes associated with methylation dysregulation using a pan-disease machine-learning approach; (2) Exploration of the contribution of the noncoding genome to methylation dysregulation through analysis of  genome variants and chromatin accessibility data; (3) Development and validation of a novel CRISPR screen to link gene perturbations to methylation  landscapes in a high-throughput manner. In summary, completion of these aims will produce an in-depth characterization of the genomic elements associated with methylation dysregulation, leading to understanding of the processes and mechanisms of epigenetic dysregulation. More broadly, the proposed analysis framework and computational approach will explore the utility of integrative pan-disease studies to identify common characteristics of disease which could lead to diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. This proposal takes advantage of the applicant's expertise in genetics, genomics, and high-throughput assays. It also includes training and research experience in experimental design and execution which will advance the candidate's goal of becoming an independent research scientist capable of investigating genome function, specifically the genomic origins of human disease. DNA methylation patterns are dysregulated in many human diseases, suggesting that elements of disease initiation may be common across diseases. The proposed research aims to characterize pan-disease patterns of methylation dysregulation and to identify genes and regulators that lead to methylation dysregulation. This will contribute to fundamental knowledge of disease initiation and identify potential targets for disease diagnosis and treatment.",Pan-disease characterization of DNA methylation dysregulation,10191781,K99HG011658,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Designs', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'large datasets', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2021,170402
"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D This section has not changed since the submission of the parent U01 grant. Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. This section has not changed since the submission of the parent U01 grant. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",10241049,U01HG009395,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedias', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guide RNA', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Ploidies', 'Published Comment', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'sequence learning', 'supervised learning', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2021,742538
"Computational Methods for Inferring Single-cell DNA Methylation and its Spatial Landscape Project Summary/Abstract The candidate, Wenpin Hou, PhD, is an applied mathematician and computational biologist serving as a postdoctoral fellow of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH). Her long-term career goal is to improve clinical practice in therapy for diseases by developing computational and statistical methods to decipher spatial and temporal gene regulatory programs using multi-omics data and implementing these methods into developmental process and diseases. The research she proposes entitled Computational Methods for Inferring Single-cell DNA Methylation and its Spatial Landscape combines advanced spatial transcriptomics techniques with computational methods to infer spatial DNA methylation landscape, which enables the accurate evaluation of the epigenomic spatial variability and epigenomic targets in therapy for diseases.

"Hit-and-Run transcription: The impact of transient interactions in dynamic gene regulatory networks that mediate rapid nutrient signaling Project Summary: This grant exploits TIME - the 4th and largely unexplored dimension of transcription - to capture transient interactions in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that are important, but missed, in vivo. This is because genome- scale methods to capture transcription factor (TF) target interactions favor stable binding, and reporter gene studies which detect transient TF-target interactions in seconds, miss global responses needed for GRN models. We aim to fill the time-gap in our collective knowledge of dynamic GRNs by experimentally capturing transient TF-target interactions globally using a cell-based temporal TF perturbation assay (Aims 1 & 2), and evaluate their importance in forecasting gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3), a main goal of systems biology. We model temporal GRNs controlling nitrogen (N)-signaling in plants, but our approaches are broadly applicable. We exploit a cell-based assay for temporal TF perturbation, TARGET, which captures transient TF-target interactions genome-wide; i) by TF-mediated gene regulation even in the absence of detectable TF-binding, ii) within minutes of controlled TF nuclear entry, and iii) identifies highly transient TF-binding leading to sustained transcription by affinity-capture of de novo mRNAs. We discovered that i) a single TF can stably or transiently bind to, and induce or repress, distinct sets of targets depending on their cis-context, ii) that transient TF-targets captured only in cells control early N-responses in planta, for two master TFs in our GRNs (bZIP1 & NLP7). This genome-wide data supports a Hit-and-Run transcription model, where a TF Hit can initiate a stable transcriptional complex, including recruitment of TF partners, enabling transcription to continue after the initiating TF is no longer bound, the Run. This could allow a small number of TF molecules to rapidly affect a large number of target genes by acting catalytically. Our studies have been cited and influenced thinking of transient transcription mechanisms across yeast, stems cells, and were invoked to explain the new discovery of transient binding of Zelda/Bicoid to a reporter gene in Drosophila. Herein, we deploy experimental and computational innovations to test the pervasiveness and in vivo significance of a conceptual innovation - transient Hit-and- Run interactions in GRNs. Our experimental innovations include; i) Assays for Hit-and-Run activity across all 70 TF families in Arabidopsis, using a higher throughput version of the cell-based TARGET assay we recently published, ii) new methods to capture TF-target interactions using time-series biotin-ChIP and DamID, which leaves DNA methylation marks on transient TF-target interactions, supported by preliminary data (Aims 1 & 2). Our computational innovations include: i) ConnectTF, a platform to integrate TF-DNA binding and RNA-seq data and identify candidate Hit-and-Run TFs, and approaches to assess the in planta relevance of transient TF- target interactions in GRNs, such as ii) our newly published Network Walking method, and iii) OutPredict, a new time-based method to forecast gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3).

"REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  PROJECT SUMMARY  DNA motifs bind transcription factors (TFs) that control gene expression in normal and diseased skin. AR45192 recently mapped the enhancers and promoters that are sequentially activated during epidermal differentiation, and found them enriched for 15 conserved DNA motif combinations, or DNA motif “grammars”. This suggested that these grammars, acting through recruitment of motif-binding TFs, may encode the DNA sequence logic that coordinates the temporal and spatial induction of early and late epidermal differentiation genes. AR45192 also found that these grammars were recurrently altered by single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs, for “expression SNPs”) linked by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to skin diseases characterized by disrupted epidermal differentiation, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This suggests that newly identified DNA motif grammars may control differentiation and that their disruption may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  Aim I will test the hypothesis that specific DNA motif grammars control the physiologic activation of differentiation genes necessary for normal epidermal function. First, it will define the temporal activity of hundreds of examples of each grammar in early and late differentiation within intact epidermis. Second, it will quantitate epidermal differentiation gene expression and barrier function in isogenic epidermal tissues in which a subset of grammars have been altered by gene-editing. Aim I is designed to characterize the actions of newly identified DNA motif grammars in epidermal differentiation.  Aim II will test the hypothesis that SCC risk eSNPs residing within epidermal differentiation motif grammars alter gene expression in a way that enhances cancer progression. First, it will define SCC eSNP impacts on gene expression in normal epidermis with a goal to understanding the altered target genes, and their biologic functions, that predispose to SCC risk. Second, it will quantitatively assess the impact of these SCC risk eSNPs, singly and in combination, on neoplastic progression of epidermal neoplasia in vivo. Aim II is designed to define the impact of regulatory DNA variants on epidermal gene expression and disease progression.  This AR45192 competing renewal will characterize the role of newly identified regulatory DNA grammars in epidermal homeostasis and neoplastic progression. RELEVANCE  Abnormal differentiation is a hallmark of common skin diseases, such as epidermal cancers, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and certain ichthyoses. Transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA motifs in enhancers to control differentiation gene expression in skin and other tissues. Characterizing the patterns of normal and disease-linked DNA sequence motifs that control epidermal differentiation may be of broad utility in the future treatment and prevention of skin disorders. REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  Project Narrative The control of gene expression determines the health or disease of human tissues, including skin. Systematic definition of the regulatory DNA motif combinations in homeostasis and early cancer progression is designed to provide information to advance human health for skin and other tissues. 1",REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION,10107766,R01AR045192,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dependovirus', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Future', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Ichthyoses', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-in', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Reporter', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'design', 'gene induction', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'keratinocyte differentiation', 'neural network algorithm', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'skin barrier', 'skin disorder', 'skin squamous cell carcinoma', 'transcription factor', 'tumor progression']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,459691
"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,10085663,R01HG009309,"['Archives', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase I', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,387500
"Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) In addition to genetics and environment, interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation may determine risk of obesity. Exceptional genomic loci called metastable epialleles offer unprecedented opportunities to test this. Metastable epialleles – essentially epigenetic polymorphisms – exhibit interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is neither tissue-specific nor genetically mediated. Metastable epialleles were first discovered in mice when dramatic phenotypic variation was observed amongst inbred mice. Over the last 10 years we pioneered the discovery and characterization of human metastable epialleles. We have shown that DNA methylation profiling of multiple tissues in multiple individuals is an effective approach to identifying regions that exhibit systemic interindividual variation in DNA methylation, a hallmark of metastable epialleles. Now that we know epigenetic metastability is common to mice and humans, it is essential to identify and explore the full range of MEs in the mouse. We therefore propose to pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Perform an unbiased screen for mouse metastable epialleles. Aim 2 - Test for effects of maternal dietary methyl donor supplementation on offspring DNA methylation at metastable epialleles. Aim 3: Use comparative genomics to identify sequence determinants of epigenetic metastability. Successful completion of these Aims will provide the foundation for development of mouse (and potentially other mammalian) models which will enable controlled experiments to help understand how interindividual variation in DNA methylation affects risk of disease in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Relevance Statement) Just as individual genetic variation can affect risk of disease, so too can individual epigenetic variation. In particular, special genomic regions called metastable epialleles, which were first discovered in mice, offer the best opportunities to advance our understanding of epigenetic etiology of disease because their systemic nature means that – like genetic polymorphisms – they can be assessed in any easily obtainable tissue sample, such as peripheral blood. Now that we know that metastable epialleles also exist in humans, we urgently need to develop a more complete catalog of these genomic regions in the mouse, to enable well- controlled experiments to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of interindividual epigenetic variation at these loci.",Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles,10190936,R01DK125562,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Assisted Reproductive Technology', 'Base Sequence', 'Beds', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cleft Palate', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Mouse', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intracisternal A-Particle Elements', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Micronutrients', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Paper', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrotransposon', 'Seminal', 'Supplementation', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'critical period', 'dietary', 'disorder risk', 'early pregnancy', 'embryo culture', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenetic variation', 'experimental study', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolic phenotype', 'mother nutrition', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nonhuman primate', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'offspring', 'peripheral blood', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,462430
"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,10208923,R01HG010045,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'comparative', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genomic locus', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'markov model', 'multi-task learning', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'novel', 'promoter', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,332892
"Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage Project Summary / Abstract In the hours after learning, the activation of gene expression follows a specific pattern, producing transient waves of expression needed for long-term memory consolidation. These changes require non-genetic (i.e., “epigenetic”) events, including modifications to: DNA-organizing proteins known as histones, the DNA itself, and the accessibility of DNA to proteins. Additionally, the molecular changes necessary for memory require a form of RNA-based regulation. In the absence of such changes, the long-lasting regulation of gene expression during memory storage fails, and this could account for defects in memory that accompany many psychiatric disorders. Our long-term goal is to define novel epigenetic mechanisms underlying memory storage and synaptic plasticity by taking advantage of recent advances in our understanding of histone modifications, in the development of single-cell RNA technology, and in the function of regulatory mechanisms mediated by small noncoding RNAs. During the previous funding period, we defined a novel metabolic source of acetyl-CoA in the nucleus and have obtained preliminary data about new forms of histone acylation and crotonylation associated with spatial learning. We also developed bioinformatic tools to analyze single nuclear RNA sequencing data to identify neurons activated by learning. We further established the reversal of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated mRNA silencing as a novel epigenetic means of regulating activity-dependent translation, linking synaptic activity to translational upregulation of key memory-related targets. These major findings provide the basis of our proposed experiments that we believe will define the next frontiers in our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms of memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the impact of a novel histone modification, histone crotonylation, on the epigenetic landscape and gene expression during memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 2, we will define cell type-specific transcriptional signatures of the hippocampal neurons during memory consolidation and retrieval. In Specific Aim 3, we will elucidate the microRNA- dependent mechanisms that regulate long-term memory and synaptic plasticity driven by a microRNA processing complex. An understanding of these key epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved in the consolidation and storage of long-term memories is expected to ultimately lead to the development of new treatments for the debilitating cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Project Narrative The regulation of specific genes critical to the storage of memories (“memory consolidation”) and changes in neuronal function (“plasticity”) vital for learning are controlled by a number of mechanisms that are not themselves regulated by genetics. We propose to determine the functional roles of such epigenetic processes in memory consolidation and plasticity, and to define the sets of genes that are activated, in individual cells, during memory consolidation. This research promises to provide information that will be critical to the development of novel therapeutics capable of alleviating the cognitive deficits underlying many psychiatric disorders.",Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage,10211384,R01MH087463,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Acetylation', 'Acyl Coenzyme A', 'Acylation', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Coenzyme A', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Histones', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear RNA', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Ribonucleases', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Derepression', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translational Repression', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'long term memory', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,740506
"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10304760,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzymes', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'HIV', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Length', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct', 'tool']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2021,52000
"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease. In the future, the approaches we develop will lead to software that suggests individualized therapies for patients based on clinical methylation data.",Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation,10168608,R01LM013096,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translating', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'clinical sequencing', 'cofactor', 'demethylation', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'individualized medicine', 'long short term memory network', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'nanopore', 'network architecture', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,366581
"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites. The development of new computational methods in combination with generation of experimental binding data will reveal the protein- family specific use of readout modes at atomic, molecular, and cellular scales.",Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding,10189652,R35GM130376,"['3-Dimensional', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Major Groove', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleosomes', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'functional group', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R35,2021,523665
"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",10075940,R01HG009906,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Hi-C', 'Intuition', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Procedures', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interest', 'mammalian genome', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'repository', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NHGRI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,395000
"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,10171878,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'hematopoietic differentiation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,513500
"Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome Abstract After the completion of the Human Genome Project, thousands of experiments from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have successfully proﬁled regulatory elements and epigenetic landscape along the genome. More recently, over 2,000 chromatin organization datasets have been generated from 4D Nucleome (4DN) Project, and they provide complementary information about how these genomic and epigenomic elements are spatially organized in a nucleus. Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization with previously proﬁled 1D epigenome in different cell types will be a key step to understand the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation over long genomic distances. However, there are two challenges. First, there is a resolution mismatch between chromatin organization data (e.g. Hi-C contacts) which are usually measured at 10k base pair resolution, and epigenome-based chromatin state features (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) whose signals are usually at tens to hundreds of base pairs. Second, existing computational approaches for analyzing epigenome, such as annotating genome and understanding regulatory elements, all treat the DNA sequence as one-dimensional data, leaving the important 3D structural information unutilized. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches for understanding the relationship between chromatin state features and chromatin organization, performing 3D and 4D genome annotation, and identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors, respectively. After the completion of the proposed work, we expect to have: (1) an accurate and interpretable computational model to predict chromatin contact maps at nucleosome resolution for a wide range of cell lines, (2) 3D and 4D genome annotations over dynamic chromatin organization, regulatory elements and epigenomic features, and (3) a computational method for identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors which can help us understand the orchestration of noncoding genetic variants. These results will provide fundamental understanding of disease-relevant genetic variation in the light of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to jointly analyze 3D chromatin organization data and 1D epigenomic features, and reveal the interplay among regulatory elements, epigenomic features, and dynamic chromatin organization. These new methods will help us understand the mechanisms of the genetic variants identiﬁed in genome-wide association studies, and understand the genetic basis of many human diseases.",Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome,10251159,R35HG011279,"['3-Dimensional', 'Base Pairing', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hi-C', 'Human Genome Project', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleosomes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'novel', 'three dimensional structure', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2021,439299
"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients.

"From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding how the genome functions is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Encoded within its DNA sequences are the blueprints for several cell types. Nevertheless, it remains a mystery how the full variety of phenotypes arise, and how they are maintained. It is becoming increasingly clear that the epigenome— covalent modifications to the DNA and histone proteins—plays a crucial role. Genome-wide profiling of epigenetic modifications has clarified cell type specificity and the presence of a diverse set of combinatorial patterns that are strongly correlated with gene expression levels. Inferring causal relationships from these data has proved challenging, however. A working knowledge of the mechanisms that inform the establishment and regulation of the epigenome, and its impact on gene expression and cellular phenotype, therefore, remain elusive. In this project, we propose several novel modeling approaches which will address the key gaps in our understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and genome. First, we will parameterize a coarse- grained chromatin model from the bottom-up using a novel deep learning algorithm to generate an accurate and comprehensive characterization of chromatin secondary structure, and its sensitivity to DNA sequence, nucleosome repeat length, ionic concentrations, post-translational modifications, and phase-separated liquid- droplets formed by intrinsically disordered proteins. High resolution chromatin structures from this effort will elucidate how different epigenetic modifications impact gene expression by regulating nucleosome packaging and DNA accessibility. Second, we will investigate the role of epigenetic modifications in mediating long-range interactions between regulatory elements by developing a predictive model which will enable de novo reconstruction of three-dimensional genome organization. This project will result in a global view of the role of the epigenome in cell differentiation and cell fate determination. An improved understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and the genome from this research program can guide the development of engineering approaches to modify the epigenome for both long lasting and reversible changes as a novel strategy for combating diseases such as cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE The epigenome works hand-in-hand with the genome to encode cell phenotypic diversity for multicellular organisms. We will apply interdisciplinary approaches to disentangle the interrelationship between the two, thus elucidating the role of the genome in establishing and maintaining a robust epigenome, and providing mechanistic insight into epigenetic regulations of the genome’s function. Insights from our study will pave the way for rational epigenome engineering which holds great potential for transforming medicine and biotechnology.",From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization,10178047,R35GM133580,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Back', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Chromatin Structure', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Grain', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Work', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2021,377555
