"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,10053725,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,656876
"Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rather than a dichotomy between health and pathology, many mental illnesses—especially depression and other mood disorders—are best conceptualized as the far end of a phenotypic spectrum, suggesting that characterizing individual differences in brain function and behavior will help further our understanding of disease. Existing work suggests that fMRI has the potential to predict individual behaviors from brain function, yet progress has been hindered by an overreliance on group studies (i.e., patients versus controls) and limited paradigms (i.e., either highly controlled tasks that risk being artificial, or at the other extreme, resting state, which is entirely unconstrained and difficult to interpret). Naturalistic fMRI, in which subjects do complex, engaging tasks such as watching films or listening to stories, offers an alternative that more closely mimics real-world cognition and may allow researchers to extract richer, more meaningful information from a single individual’s scan. As such, these paradigms are promising candidates for brain “stress tests” that would elicit patterns of brain activity that predict present or future behaviors. The specific aims of this project are: (1) to leverage existing large-scale datasets to develop methods to predict phenotypes from naturalistic fMRI data; (2) to design and conduct an fMRI study using targeted film stimuli to draw out individual variability of interest, specifically in traits related to depression; and (3) to extend the newly developed paradigms and analyses to a longitudinal study of a population at risk for depression and/or other mood disorders. Several innovative approaches to data analysis will be investigated. The central hypothesis is that brain activity evoked by these paradigms will vary across individuals in a continuous, multidimensional space that covaries with phenotype strength, that these relationships will be strong enough to predict phenotypes in unseen individuals, and that modified (e.g., attenuated) versions of patterns associated with illness will be detectable via these paradigms in those at risk before the emergence of symptoms. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded faculty member at a research-intensive university, with a research program exploring the basic cognitive neuroscience of individual differences in personality and cognition, as well as developing translational applications for psychiatry. To reach this goal, the training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s skills in the following areas: (1) applying machine learning techniques to predict individual-subject behavior from fMRI data; (2) conducting neuroimaging and behavioral research on depression and mood disorders with clinical and at-risk populations; and (3) gaining professional skills essential for a successful independent research career. The environment in which the career development will take place is the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, a vibrant community with outstanding resources to support the proposed project, including relevant courses and seminars, state-of-the-art facilities for MRI data acquisition and analysis, computing power, and expertise and guidance from senior scientists in neuroscience, engineering, machine learning and psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mental illness—especially depression and other mood disorders—is a massive burden on individuals, families and societies, yet psychiatrists lack brain-based biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. This project seeks to fill that gap by conceptualizing mood disorders as the extreme end of a continuous phenotypic spectrum in the human population, and using functional brain imaging to study how individuals differ in their neural and behavioral responses to naturalistic, emotionally evocative stimuli. This project will deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of individual variability related to mood disorders, and has the potential to lead to a “stress test” for psychiatry that would help identify at-risk individuals for earlier intervention.",Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum,10238174,R00MH120257,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Cognition', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Film', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Processes', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Normalcy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Senior Scientist', 'Social Environment', 'Societies', 'Stimulus', 'Stress Tests', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'emotional stimulus', 'healthy volunteer', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'member', 'mood symptom', 'movie', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R00,2021,249000
"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression.

"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,10177987,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic platform', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,603973

"Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support PROJECT SUMMARY Treatments for mental health conditions such as unipolar depression provide modest average benefit but have wide variation between individuals and within individuals over time. Evidence-based customized treatment protocols would improve the mental health care of many people by providing treatment recommendations for individuals that take into account potential variation because of personal characteristics such as current health status, symptoms, and response to earlier treatment. Generating customized treatment protocols requires large amounts of data, such as from networks of health systems that can link electronic health records from millions of individuals. Current statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols are limited in three important ways.  First, current approaches rely on scientists to select the patient characteristics to use to customize treatments instead of using data to find the patient characteristics that will lead to improved, customized care. Second, customized treatment protocols discovered with current statistical methods assume no unobserved differences between individuals who receive various treatment options. Third, investigators do not have ways to know if the available data contain enough information to discover and compare customized treatment protocols precisely enough to make clinical decisions. We will address these three limitations by developing new statistical tools for discovering customized treatment protocols using electronic health records data. Our research team has expertise and experience in statistics, epidemiology, and mental health care. We will integrate methods that have been successfully used in other settings to improve statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols and address these three important limitations.  We will extend machine learning tools for selecting important pieces of information to the time-varying data structure required for discovering customized treatment protocols. We will build approaches that use available knowledge about the size of unobserved differences between groups of people who received different treatments to assess how those differences change study results. By building on the math used to estimate the sample sizes needed for precision in randomized trials with complex designs, we will develop new formulas for determining how many people with a particular condition and who took a particular drug are needed in a health system to provide enough accurate information to discover customized treatment protocols.  Using data from the electronic health records of more than 15,000 patients, we will discover customized treatment protocols for depression. By improving statistical tools and addressing current limitations, our customized treatment protocols will have immediate impact for people living with unipolar depression. The statistical tools we develop will also be useful for discovering customized treatment protocols for people with a wide variety of mental health conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with mental health conditions and their health care providers often lack evidence for making choices about numerous treatment options and they do not have evidence-based, customized treatment plans. This project will develop customized treatment plans for unipolar depression and methods to generate these plans using data from electronic health care records. This work will address current limitations in statistical methods for selecting patient characteristics for customizing treatment, assessing bias from differences between people who take different medications, and calculating how many people are needed to accurately compare customized treatment plans using data from electronic health records.",Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support,10164627,R01MH114873,"['13 year old', 'Address', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'practice setting', 'precision medicine', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,373803
"Characterization of Novel Neural Respiratory Circuit to Counter Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression PROJECT SUMMARY We have identified a novel property of the cervical spinal cord that modulates respiratory activity, both the rate and depth of breathing, such that the respiratory drive in opioid-suppressed states in mice and humans increases during spinal cord epidural stimulation. Respiratory rates are increased upon epidural stimulation of specific cervical spinal cord locations when there is spontaneous breathing, and rhythmic breathing can be generated when the respiratory state is depressed and spontaneous breathing is absent. This is an important observation because the brainstem, which contains the rhythm-generating center for respiration, is a difficult area for surgical and therapeutic access. If there are other accessible neural regions by surgery (i.e. epidural stimulation) or non-invasive means (i.e. transcutaneous stimulation), for example in the cervical spine, that influence respiration or contain their own rhythmic respiratory elements, these may represent potential therapeutic targets to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression. Thus, we have proposed a strategy to characterize this novel cervical respiratory circuit. First, we will conduct extensive electrical mapping of the respiratory responsive elements of the cervical spinal cord in mice aided by machine learning strategies, and we will characterize the mechanistic basis for this response, the relation to opioid receptors to the respiratory response, and identity neurons responsible for the respiratory response using optogenetic techniques. Guided by the animal studies, we will then confirm the cervical respiratory responsive loci in humans. Third, we will subject the identified respiratory competent regions to increasing doses of opioid to further characterize the dose-response profile of these regions. Fourth, we will assess the feasibility and practical translation of this strategy to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression in three patients implanted with spinal cord stimulators. These studies will provide an anatomical and electrophysiological characterization of the respiratory circuit within the cervical spine and provide practical information for the treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression. The results obtained, especially because they are obtained in humans, will have an immediate translational impact on our understanding of the respiratory circuit that may, in turn, prevent deaths due to opioid overdose. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid overdose often leads to death due to suppression of respiration; therefore, strategies to prevent respiratory depression in addition to treatment of opioid addiction are necessary to prevent deaths in the opioid-use epidemic. Respiratory suppression occurs because neurons in the brain that drive breathing are inhibited (turned off) by narcotics; thus, understanding the neural pathways for breathing will allow us to devise effective neuromodulatory strategies to treat opioid-induced respiratory depression. We have proposed to characterize a novel breathing circuit that, when activated by stimulation of the cervical spine, has the potential to be an effective treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression, and it is our hope that findings from these studies may lead to new and more effective treatments for respiratory depression secondary to opioid overdoses.",Characterization of Novel Neural Respiratory Circuit to Counter Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression,10176443,R01DA047637,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Cervical spine', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Coughing', 'Depressed mood', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Drug Implants', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Monitor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotics', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Respiration', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Respiratory Center', 'Respiratory Muscles', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Strenuous Exercise', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'Vital Statistics', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mu opioid receptors', 'neuroprosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'optogenetics', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'transcutaneous stimulation', 'translational approach', 'translational impact', 'ventilation']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,701059
"Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation Dissociative symptoms in traumatized individuals are common, debilitating, and costly; however, little is known about how its biological mechanisms interact with PTSD treatment. Traumatic dissociation broadly encompasses a range of distinct, yet clinically interrelated symptoms: depersonalization, derealization, amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, passive influence phenomena, and identity disturbances. Either alone or in various combinations, these symptoms serve as diagnostic criteria and commonly associated features across multiple psychiatric disorders. Traumatic dissociation is also associated with significant personal and societal burden. Traumatized individuals with dissociative symptoms typically have co-occurring psychiatric conditions, high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicidality, and are disproportionate treatment utilizers. In addition, they are at increased risk for attrition, non-response and relapse following treatment interventions. Despite the significant and disabling nature of traumatic dissociative symptoms, little is known about the neurobiology of these processes and targeted interventions do not exist.  PTSD treatment studies have neither looked at neural intermediate phenotypes of dissociation, nor how these are associated with psychophysiological and digital phenotypes. Compared to clinical symptom measures, these biological and in-the-moment digital markers of dissociation may more robustly map onto the underlying core aspects of the disorder differentiating dissociation subtypes following childhood and adult trauma. We propose to build upon our prior Exploratory R21 to now capture longitudinal multimodal phenotype data related to dissociation, pre-, post- and during PTSD treatment modalities that include empirically-derived, exposure-based components.  The goals of this study will be 1) to understand the differential biomarkers that map onto dissociative symptoms, and 2) to understand how these biomarkers may best predict trajectory of response to empirically based standard-of-care treatments. For each of these Aims, we will collect Neuroimaging, Physiology, and Digital Phenotyping data, applying computational modeling with multimodal data to provide machine-learning based, unbiased predictive models of dissociative intermediate phenotypes at baseline and longitudinally. This naturalistic study will allow us to map the biology of dissociation, and importantly, the change in dissociative symptoms and underlying biomarkers over time, using naturalistic evidenced-based treatment for PTSD in 130 treatment-seeking patients with PTSD, and a range of dissociative symptoms.  Successful completion of these Aims will provide a novel and powerful understanding of the biological markers of dissociation subtypes following trauma exposure, and will identify biological mechanisms for understanding and treating PTSD with dissociation. Pathological trauma-related dissociation is a significant personal and societal burden. This proposal will examine behavioral and biological correlates of dissociation across imaging, physiology, and digital assessments. Results from this proposal will inform how to identify those at risk for these debilitating symptoms, potential brain regions to target for treatment, and may support a new standard of clinical care for PTSD with dissociation. ",Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation,10129433,R01MH119227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Amnesia', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depersonalization', 'Derealizations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Dorsal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbness', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Destructive Behavior', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'digital', 'disabling symptom', 'emotion regulation', 'heart rate variability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted therapy trials', 'time use', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,723138
"Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Adolescent depression is a major public health concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We know that adolescent depression varies considerably in severity and course, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This proposal addresses this concern, aiming to identify biobehavioral predictors of illness trajectory in adolescents to inform treatment influencing its course. Our overall hypothesis is that reward dysfunction and its underlying neuro-immunological mechanisms contribute to maintenance of depression in youth. We propose the following model: (1) peripheral inflammation (e.g., cytokines, kynurenines) is associated with anhedonia; (2) inflammation extends to the CNS, inducing oxidative stress [↓glutathione (GSH, antioxidant)] and GABA (inhibitory neurotransmitter) deficits; (3) such neuro-chemical changes alter the reward circuitry, leading to anhedonia, and contribute to depression progression. In support, we documented that of adolescent depression’s core symptoms, only anhedonia—reflecting deficits in reward processes—and not irritability was associated with worse outcome, including suicidality and chronicity. We also reported associations between circulatory cytokines and kynurenines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry. Utilizing proton MR spectroscopy (1H MRS), we showed that decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA in adolescent depression was driven by anhedonia. Additionally, using fMRI, we mapped striatal-based connectivity in relation to anhedonia and documented distinct neural activation patterns of reward anticipation and attainment—both reward processes that contribute to anhedonia. In pilot studies, we found that ACC GABA and reward- anticipation brain activation predicted anhedonia severity at 2-year follow-up. Building upon our compelling findings to date, we propose a prospective study of reward processes and neuroimmunological mechanisms, with the goal to identify modifiable pathways predictive of depression course in adolescents. We will study 120 adolescents with depressive symptoms. Three in-laboratory comprehensive clinical evaluation and computerized reward task sessions will be done at baseline, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. At baseline and 12 months, visits will include: a) immune blood collection for kynurenine metabolites, immune cell profiling, and cytokine secretion post immune stimulation (as a biological stressor); b) fMRI resting state and tasks examining distinct reward processes (e.g., anticipation, attainment, learning); and c) 1H MRS to probe ACC GABA and striatal GSH as indices for inflammatory neurometabolic consequences in reward-related brain regions. Outcome measures will include anhedonia severity (primary), along with depression severity, functioning, anxiety, and suicidality. Principled variable selection approach will address multiple comparison concerns. Dynamic causal modeling and machine learning classification methods will explore the relationships among all examined factors.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to better understand the mechanisms contributing to the maintenance and severity of adolescent depression. A prospective multimodal study will test the overall hypothesis that reward dysfunction and associated neuroimmunological abnormalities contribute to depression progression in youth. Such work would provide information on modifiable factors to facilitate novel treatment approaches influencing the course of illness early on and prior to chronicity effects, so that we may work to ameliorate morbidity and mortality of this devastating disorder.",Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression,10128500,R01MH120601,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Antioxidants', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immune', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protons', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral construct', 'biobehavior', 'causal model', 'cell type', 'child depression', 'cingulate cortex', 'computerized', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pleasure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'reward anticipation', 'reward circuitry', 'sex', 'stressor', 'subthreshold depression']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,786200
"Identifying Person-Specific Drivers of Adolescent Depression via Idiographic Network Modeling of Active and Passive Smartphone Data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adolescents experience escalating risk for developing clinical depression, which can lead to lifelong morbidity and mortality. The neural, physical, cognitive, and socioemotional changes that may contribute to this risk also signal an opportunity for high impact intervention. Unfortunately, psychotherapy trials demonstrate modest effects on youth depression. To improve long-term outcomes for adolescents, this study will identify person- specific drivers of adolescent depression that can guide treatment personalization. Prior research with depressed or anxious adults demonstrates the existence of such drivers—symptoms and related processes that are influential (i.e., predict change in other symptoms), modifiable, and exhibit individual differences. Personalized selection and sequencing of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules to target these drivers early in adults have produced larger treatment effects compared to a historical benchmark. Identifying person- specific drivers during adolescence could inform treatments that account for both developmental and individual differences to shift the trajectory of depression onset and maintenance. Investigating person-specific drivers usually involves intensive surveying of self-reported experience via smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Emerging evidence suggests that smartphones can also monitor mood through passive sensing of depression-related behaviors with minimal response burden. However, nearly all such studies have been conducted with adults, despite near universal smartphone ownership among adolescents in the US. Thus, this study will leverage depressed adolescents' everyday smartphone use to assess the validity of mobile sensing against established ambulatory methods (i.e., EMA and actigraphy) to identify person-specific drivers of adolescent depression. Fifty adolescents (12–18 years old) with elevated depressive symptoms will participate in 30 days of: a) smartphone-based EMA of depressive symptoms, processes, and affect (4x/day), sleep diary (1x/day); (b) mobile sensing of mobility, physical activity, sleep, natural language use in typed interpersonal communication, screen-on time and call frequency/duration; and (c) wrist actigraphy of physical activity and sleep. Adolescents and caregivers will complete diagnostic interviews and other measures (e.g., developmental, clinical, Research Domain Criteria) at baseline, as well as user feedback interviews at follow- up. To address study aims: 1) idiographic, within-subject networks of EMA symptoms will be modeled to identify each adolescent's drivers; 2) correlations among EMA, mobile sensor, and actigraph measures of sleep, physical, and social activity; and machine learning prediction of core depressive symptoms (self- reported mood and anhedonia) will be used to assess the validity of mobile sensing for identifying person- specific drivers; 3) between-subject baseline characteristics will be explored as predictors of person-specific drivers. These results will inform future development of a scalable, low-burden smartphone-based tool that can guide personalized treatment decisions for depressed adolescents, with potential public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescence is marked by escalating risk for developing clinical depression, but also presents an optimal window for high impact intervention to alter the course of this often disabling disorder. To inform future efforts to personalize psychological interventions for depressed adolescents and maximize their efficacy, the proposed study will identify person-specific drivers of adolescent depression—influential and modifiable symptoms and processes that exhibit individual differences—and demonstrate the validity of using a smartphone tool to identify these person-specific drivers. The proposed study will generate data to inform the development of a scalable, low-burden, smartphone-based tool to guide treatment decisions, with potential public health impact given near-universal smartphone ownership among adolescents across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups in the US.",Identifying Person-Specific Drivers of Adolescent Depression via Idiographic Network Modeling of Active and Passive Smartphone Data,10196290,R21MH126394,"['18 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Communication', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'anxious', 'base', 'child depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'diaries', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'network models', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'racial and ethnic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,198257
"Habenula Developmental Trajectories in the ABCD Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Converging evidence has linked the habenula (Hb), a small epithalamic structure that inhibits dopaminergic reward signaling, to a wide range of affective, motivational, and motor functions. Abnormalities in Hb circuitry are increasingly implicated in psychiatric and behavioral disorders. In vivo Hb research has proceeded slowly, however, due to technical constraints in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that make it difficult to define and characterize this small region. Understanding of the Hb is especially limited in adolescence, a critical period marked by rapid maturation of the reward system and, often, the first emergence of psychiatric disorders. To address these gaps in basic and clinical neuroscience, our proposal leverages the unprecedented scale and quality of high-resolution neuroimaging data available through the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the development of Hb function in early adolescence and its role in psychiatric illness onset. The proposed research builds on extensive work by our group to develop and refine Hb imaging methodology, including automated segmentation and a region of interest optimization approach that significantly improves Hb fMRI sensitivity, and is supported by substantial data from our laboratory. In independent samples of adult and adolescent healthy controls (HCs), we found a highly consistent pattern of positive Hb intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) with the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA), downstream nucleus accumbens (NAc), and cortical salience network (SN), as well as negative Hb iFC throughout the default mode network (DMN). Adults with high vs. low subclinical depression scores exhibited distinct iFC patterns with regions associated with anxiety and depression, including the amygdala and insula. Moreover, adolescents with mood and anxiety disorders had positive Hb iFC with the DMN, and this abnormal Hb-DMN iFC pattern was associated with anxiety severity across both healthy and clinical adolescents, while hyperconnectivity with SN and other expected Hb targets correlated with anhedonia. Building on our compelling findings to date, we propose to study Hb function at Baseline and Year 2 ABCD neuroimaging timepoints in relation to normative (Aim 1) and clinical (Aim 2) developmental trajectories. Subjects will comprise two cohorts of ~3000 adolescents each: clinical subjects, with significant past or current mood and anxiety symptoms, and HCs, with no history of psychiatric diagnoses or clinically significant symptoms. Study procedures will incorporate sophisticated preprocessing and denoising, optimized subject-level Hb definition, neuroanatomically accurate cortical surface mapping, and rigorous non-parametric statistics. Analyses will encompass both resting-state and task fMRI to characterize Hb iFC and activation during specific reward, loss, and inhibitory control processes. We will examine both group differences and associations with psychiatric symptom severity using hypothesis-driven as well as machine learning approaches.  PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to advance basic and clinical neuroscientific understanding of the habenula, a small structure that inhibits dopaminergic reward signaling and is increasingly implicated in psychiatric disorders. The technical difficulty of studying the habenula has limited in vivo research, especially in adolescent populations where psychiatric symptoms often first emerge. Using an optimize analysis approach and a large sample of high- resolution neuroimaging data from the ABCD study, we propose to comprehensively investigate habenula function in normative early adolescent development and in the onset and trajectory of adolescent mental illness.",Habenula Developmental Trajectories in the ABCD Study,10234369,R21MH126501,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Health', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epithalamic structure', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Habenula', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'Youth', 'animal data', 'anxiety symptoms', 'automated segmentation', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'connectome', 'critical period', 'denoising', 'early adolescence', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mood symptom', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'reward circuitry', 'subclinical depression', 'tv watching']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,210000
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,10204099,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,378686
"Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of the proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to provide the PI with the mentorship, theoretical knowledge, and research skills to develop into a fully independent psychophysiological researcher studying biomarkers of depression that can be used as targets for novel interventions. In consultation with her mentors, the PI has recruited a team of expert consultants to guide her in executing a research project and training plan that will provide experience essential to her goals.  The proposed study will be conducted at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry. The study focuses on late-life depression because it is prevalent and has negative outcomes. Existing treatments have low response rates and are rarely used correctly in the community due to their complexity. The project is based on the premise that focused treatments targeting biosignatures of specific neural abnormalities will have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes in late-life depression. It concentrates on positive valence systems, which are vulnerable to aging and often impaired in depression. The project will investigate positive valence systems in older adults with major depression receiving Engage, a psychotherapy designed to reactivate reward system functions. Engage has been found efficacious in late-life depression and easy to learn by community-based therapists. Consistent with RDoC methods, the proposed study will examine target engagement of Engage in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) during a 9-week course of Engage therapy, using three units of analysis to assess positive valence system function: physiology (event-related potentials), self-reports, and behavior. It will compare Engage-treated participants with 35 depressed participants, group-matched on age, receiving manualized supportive therapy. Additional analyses will assess whether low baseline positive valence function, or increases in positive valence function during treatment, predict improvement of anhedonia with Engage, and whether reward function mediates change in anhedonia.  The proposed training plan complements the research study with individualized tutorials, formal coursework, research collaborations, and manuscript preparation that will provide the PI with knowledge and skills in several areas: 1) Age-related neurobiological changes in the positive valence system and related networks; 2) Advanced statistical techniques to identify distinct neural abnormalities in depressed individuals based on their ERP profiles; and 3) Clinical trial design for psychotherapeutic interventions. The proposed project may provide important information about target engagement and mechanisms of a biologically informed, easily implemented treatment for late-life depression that has potential for dissemination. It will also provide pilot data for an R-series study using machine learning methods to predict response to Engage and will serve as an important stepping-stone for the PI as she prepares for an independent research career. Late-life depression is prevalent and devastating, and response rates to even the most effective treatments are low. Outcomes may be improved by developing targeted interventions such as Engage – a new, easily disseminated, neurobiologically informed psychotherapy for late-life depression designed to restore impaired function of the positive valence system. The proposed study will use event-related potentials and a panel of other positive valence system measures to assess target engagement in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) receiving Engage therapy, with a comparison group of 35 age-group-matched depressed peers receiving supportive therapy.",Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression,10194608,K23MH116105,"['Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuscripts', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positive Valence', 'Preparation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Stimulus', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Visual attention', 'age group', 'age related', 'base', 'biosignature', 'career', 'career development', 'comparison group', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'extrastriate', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning community', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'opioid user', 'peer', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'sustained attention', 'trait']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2021,190534
"1/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric disorders Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. IN particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 26,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,500 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance.

"From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models PROJECT SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating neuropsychiatric illness that affects 2-5% of youth and causes morbidity, functional impairment, and suicide. Prodromal manic symptoms without manic episodes usually emerge before BD types I and II (BD-I/II) develop, but less than 60% of youth with manic symptoms will develop BD-I/II. The uncertainty of diagnosis and illness progression results in potentially detrimental interventions and 7-10 years delay appropriate treatments. It is thus imperative that objective biomarkers of risk for conversion to BD-I/II are identified and tested in youth before the peak onset of illness. Given that neural measures of structure and function associated with emotion and reward processing, in combination with clinical and behavior measures, can improve prediction of psychiatric outcomes in youth, this project will investigate brain-behavior relations in the most severely ill youth during inpatient stays and aims to build a predictive model of BD. We aim to use two distinct analytic models to test our hypotheses. First a general linear model (GLM) with a machine learning (ML) model of regularized regression with cross validation and second a whole brain ML pattern recognition model. We will first identify neural and behavioral markers of BD-I/II in circuitry associated with emotion and reward processing. We hypothesize that decreased activity and connectivity in prefrontal, amygdala, and striatal regions and behavioral measures showing less sleep, lower activity, and poorer mood and cognition will distinguish BD- I/II from clinically matched youth without mania and healthy. Next, we will identify using ML a whole brain neural classifier of BD-I/II relative to clinically matched inpatients without mania. Aim 2 is to, after two years, identify and quantify the neural and behavioral measures that predict conversion to BD-I/II, and to test individual conversion in an independent group of high symptomatic risk adolescents. Aim 3 is to identify brain-behavior associations for app development. Training samples include mid-/post- pubertal adolescents aged 13-17 years recruited from the nation’s only specialized inpatient unit for adolescents with BD and the general adolescent unit at our hospital; 70 well-characterized adolescents with BD-I/II, a clinically matched group of 70 inpatient youth without mania. Testing sample is an independent group of 180 adolescents with manic symptoms without BD-I/II. 60 healthy controls will be recruited. The project includes emotion and reward processing neural function and structure, clinical and behavioral measures including sleep and activity with actigraphy, computerized cognitive measures, and self-reports during inpatient evaluation and for two weeks post discharge. At two-year follow up, clinical assessments will confirm diagnoses. This is the first study to employ a multimodal assessment of behavior and mood symptoms combined with multimodal imaging methods to comprehensively assess disease-specific abnormalities and prediction of BD-I/II. Findings from this study may identify biological and behavioral markers of conversion to BD-I/II in adolescents and may contribute developing disease-specific risk calculators, low-cost biosensors for mobile applications, and novel targets of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescents may experience manic symptoms that may or may not progress into bipolar disorder. This proposed longitudinal study would be the first of its kind and could shed light on the neural and behavioral markers of disease progression in high-risk adolescents with manic symptoms. Identifying such markers for bipolar disorder has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of illness and informing treatment planning and personalized interventions.",From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models,10116487,R01MH121451,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manic', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parietal', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physical activity', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proxy', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'digital', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'high-risk adolescents', 'hypomania', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'mobile application', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment planning', 'two-dimensional', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,695997
"MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing. ABSTRACT As rates of adolescent depression and suicidality continue to trend upwards, the healthcare system struggles to address the need for and lack of mental health service use. The pediatric patient-centered medical home model may improve adolescent depression outcomes by enhancing access to and coordinating care, as well as providing ongoing monitoring. Unfortunately, despite guideline recommendations, over 2/3 of adolescents identified with depression symptoms in primary care do not receive symptom monitoring and 19% do not re- ceive symptom reassessment. This lack of symptom monitoring and reassessment can result in untoward health outcomes including a decrease in functioning, increased use of acute and crisis services, and hospitali- zations due to suicidality. Current technologies which incorporate data passively collected from smartphones offer an opportunity for intercurrent monitoring between patient visits which limits burden on the patient to self- report and limits burden on the healthcare system, allowing primary care teams to triage contacting and as- sessing patients a system identifies with an increase in disease severity. This formative study will demonstrate the usability and potential clinical utility of MoodRing, a technology intervention which will collect passive mo- bile phone sensor data on aspects of adolescent phone use related to depressive symptom severity (e.g. com- munication patterns, social media use, travel) and integrate this data into a multi-user (adolescent, parent, pri- mary care provider/care manager) platform from which symptoms can be viewed and secure communication can occur. MoodRing, as supported by Health Belief Model, may lead to improved quality of depression man- agement (increased symptom reassessment, therapy/medication adherence) through increasing self-efficacy, social support from parent and care team, as well as encouraging application of self-management skills through increased self-management knowledge, skills, and symptom feedback. MoodRing builds on a solid foundation of investigators experienced in design of technology interventions to increase adolescent initiation of depression treatment, who have already developed machine algorithms for passive sensing and a small business partner with vast experience in working with health researchers to develop multi-user web/mobile platforms. This STTR Phase I study seeks to accomplish two aims. The first is to apply a machine learning pipeline developed for college-aged youth to adolescents with depression and determine whether self-reported depressive symptoms can be reliably predicted from passive data with at least 85% accuracy. The second is the user design and system architecture of MoodRing. If milestones are achieved that models are successful at predicting depressive symptoms and the proposed MoodRing intervention is acceptable to adolescents, par- ents, and primary care providers/care managers, then we will pursue the STTR Phase II study. The aims of Phase II include the development and subsequent efficacy trial of MoodRing. Specifically, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting of MoodRing as compared to usual care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression affects up to a fifth of adolescents but less than half get treatment. This project aims to develop and design MoodRing, a technology platform, which will gather information about how an adolescent uses their mobile phone and translate that into what it means about symptoms of depression they are experiencing. This platform will provide symptom feedback to the adolescent themselves, their parent, and their healthcare pro- vider, with the goal that having awareness of symptoms and a safe place to communicate with parents and healthcare providers will allow for more adolescents to better self-manage their mood and get better quality treatment for depression.",MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing.,10023371,R44MH122067,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bile fluid', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social support', 'Solid', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'aged', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'health belief', 'health care service utilization', 'health service use', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric patients', 'persistent symptom', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'primary care setting', 'remote screening', 'routine screening', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'social media', 'suicide rate', 'system architecture', 'therapy adherence', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response', 'trend', 'university student', 'usability']",NIMH,NURELM E-BUSINESS SOFTWARE,R44,2021,790709
"Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation Project Summary  We are in critical need of targeted and individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affect nearly 50% of Americans during our lifetimes. Brain stimulation treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), represent the front-line of innovative approaches to correct dysfunctional brain networks for patients suffering from mental illness. rTMS is FDA-approved for depression and obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) with clinical trials underway for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use, among others. However, as currently administered, rTMS lacks a biomarker to individually optimize treatment and thus suffers from a poor clinical response rate (<50%). Without personalization of rTMS, we risk a one-size-fits-all treatment for all psychiatric disorders, not dissimilar to how antidepressants are administered.  Using simultaneous TMS and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), I identified a depression severity biomarker from a double-blind randomized clinical trial treating depressed patients with one month of active or placebo rTMS. The degree of this biomarker change significantly predicted clinical improvement after rTMS treatment. Direct brain recordings further suggest that a single stimulation session is sufficient to modulate this biomarker, indicating that this brain-based biomarker can be monitored daily to support empiric treatment optimization.  With this in mind, I propose to develop the first broadly generalizable platform for real-time biomarker monitoring (Aim #1) and personalized rTMS treatment (Aims #2 & 3). I will enroll 54 depressed patients to participate in a cross-over, placebo-controlled study directly comparing personalized, adaptive rTMS to standard rTMS. Primary outcome will be target engagement and dose-response of the depression severity biomarker. Successful implementation of this work includes the early stratification of treatment responders and personalized and more effective treatments for non-responders. This approach is broadly applicable to other depression biomarkers, all psychiatric populations treated with rTMS, and other brain stimulation modalities. More generally, my goals are to establish the fundamental principles of human brain plasticity and to construct platforms for rapid biomarker development, engagement, and integration into personalized brain stimulation treatments. Project Narrative We need targeted, individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affects nearly 50% of Americans. Brain stimulation treatments target dysfunctional brain networks with minimal side effects but are currently applied in a one-size-fits-all manner, thus limiting its efficacy. I aim to develop a non-invasive personalized brain stimulation platform for neuropsychiatric disorders; here I will create a real-time monitoring system for brain changes, evaluate the mechanism underlying these brain changes, and develop and test an adaptive stimulation paradigm to maximally drive individual brain changes and improve clinical outcome.","Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation",10020446,R01MH126639,"['Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Markers', 'Book Chapters', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Length', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinical predictors', 'depressed patient', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'journal article', 'lectures', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'placebo controlled study', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'real time monitoring', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'side effect', 'tenure track', 'time use', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment responders', 'treatment stratification']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,391250
"Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY This application aims to advance our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) by combining genetic information and analyzing speech patterns of those with MDD to identify subtypes. MDD is the leading cause of disability throughout the world, yet, relative to other common disorders, less is known about its origins. There are less effective treatments and much less is spent on trying to understand how it arises and how to cure it. Current treatments are relatively ineffective, with up 50% of patients refractory and many suffering severe recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MDD has been recognized as a grand challenge in global mental health. Thus, developing new treatments for MDD is a major priority for public health. A major challenge for MDD research is the presence of heterogeneity. The existence of multiple subtypes of MDD has been suspected for a long time, and likely confounds the ability to treat the disorder appropriately with existing treatments, as well as making it hard to identify the causes of MDD as a prelude to developing new treatments. However finding subtypes has been hard. Given that the way people talk can reflect alterations in mood, we expect voice to be able to predict mood, and hence potentially be used as biomarker to recognize heterogeneity. In preliminary data show that in combination with genetic data high-dimensional vocal features extracted from recordings can be used to identify subtypes. Furthermore, the use of genetic data allows us to impute voice features into large biobanks where no recordings exist, making it possible to explore the relationship between vocal features and a rich array of clinically important indicators. We explore the power of voice to make a diagnosis of MDD, to predict severity and other clinical features. Applying our approach to will inform clinical management, improving diagnosis, refine treatment and aid the development of new treatments PROJECT NARRATIVE The research proposed here will contribute to an understanding of major depressive disorder, the commonest psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability throughout the world. The proposal will combine information from voice recordings and genetics to identify subtypes of depression and develop robust predictors of mood, severity of illness and other clinical indicators. Our research will thereby provide new insights into disease, and well enable the more effective targeting of therapy to those who will most benefit at the appropriate time.",Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder,10238767,R01MH122569,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Far East', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Woman', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'data sharing', 'deep neural network', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'long short term memory', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'psychogenetics', 'public health priorities', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,667757
"Deciphering principles of network dynamics underlying depression symptom severity from multi-day intracranial recordings in patients with major depression PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common and causes significant disability world-wide. While typically responsive to medications and therapy, there remain a subset of patients who are treatment resistant. Novel approaches are critical to treat these patients. MDD is likely caused by dysfunction in distributed neural networks, a perspective consistent with the etiological and diagnostic heterogeneity of this disorder. While imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) have helped identify MDD circuitry, no consensus has been reached on the identification of diagnostic biomarkers. Furthermore, the dynamics of MDD circuitry in relation to symptom severity is unknown. Characterization of circuit signatures that define MDD symptom severity states and the extent to which these circuits are modifiable using electrical stimulation are critical for therapeutic advancement.  Intracranial EEG (iEEG) offers a high spatial and temporal resolution method to study depression networks. For the first time, we have an unparalleled opportunity to study such circuits in MDD patients participating in a clinical trial of personalized responsive neurostimulation for treatment resistant depression (PRESIDIO). In stage 1 of this trial, participants are implanted with 160 electrodes from 10 sub-chronic intracranial leads across 10 brain sites for 10 days. The goal of this parent study stage is to optimize brain-site targeting for deep brain stimulation. In this proposal, we will leverage the opportunity to study MDD circuit principles from cortical and deep brain structures over a multi-day time period.  In an ancillary study to this parent clinical trial, we propose a set of experiments that establish basic principles of network dynamics underlying MDD from direct neural recordings. This proposal is organized around the principal concept that brain circuit dysfunction is reflected in abnormal signatures of functional connectivity and rhythmic local-field activity. This concept is supported by our pilot work where we found evidence of distinct MDD networks characterized by functional connectivity and spectral activity. Furthermore, in the first parent trial participant we successfully mapped MDD circuits at the individual level and found that gamma power in the amygdala could successfully decode mood state (AUC = 86%). This proposal builds on these preliminary findings in two aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize state-dependent functional connectivity and spectral activity in relation to symptom severity. In Aim 2, we will examine the manner and time course in which targeted electrical stimulation acutely modifies circuits. Together, this research will yield the first characterization of connectivity and activity dynamics in MDD over a multi-day period from direct neural recordings. This rare insight into MDD circuity provided by this novel dataset establishes proof-of-concept principles for biomarker development and therapeutic target selection that could critically advance personalized MDD treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The characterization of circuit dynamics underlying mood states in major depression and the acute modifiability of circuit features is an innovative and poorly understood area of research. Using an unparalleled dataset of invasive multi-day neural recordings from 160 contacts in patients with major depression who are taking part in a clinical trial of closed loop deep brain stimulation (PRESDIO trial), we seek to identify a set of neural connectivity and activity features that characterize symptom severity states, and to determine whether circuit features can be acutely modified by brain stimulation.

"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,10063043,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,498501
"Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective and easy-to-tolerate treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). TMS is costly and time-intensive so identifying markers of response would reduce financial and psychological burden. Further, treatment response is highly variable. Clinical and diagnostic heterogeneity of depression contributes to significant variability in neural markers of response. The literature on neural markers is complicated by variability in TMS intensity and targets, which may further modify response. Electrical field models estimate the degree to which a target is stimulated by considering both the intensity and structural information of each participant but at this time there are no studies that have investigated the association between brain electrical fields and treatment response. Moreover, the neurobiological correlates of dorsolateral (dlPFC) TMS treatment response are not well understood. Machine learning may be able to help us understand these complex set of features and their association to treatment response. Thus to appropriately personalize treatments, I will develop a data-driven machine learning model that uses the following: (1) pre- treatment resting state connectivity that reflects circuit dysregulation; (2) electrical field modeling to estimate the electrical field or voltage on individual patient’s brain, as a marker of sufficiency of stimulation; and (3) expected target network connectivity as a marker of target engagement. We have previously demonstrated feasibility of machine learning to predict antidepressant response in MDD. We will optimize and expand a model developed on archival University of Toronto data that predicted dlPFC TMS response. We will validate this externally on three sets of data: data we collect at University of Pittsburgh, archival data from Brown University, and sham TMS data. As an exploratory aim, we will identify whether our model that predicts dlPFC TMS treatment response is capable of predicting response to dmPFC TMS stimulation. During my PhD in Bioengineering, I developed kernel-based machine learning models to personalize neural networks markers of antidepressant response. Given the clinical and neural heterogeneity of depression, I will leverage my machine learning and neuroimaging experience by receiving training in advanced optimization approaches and depression neurobiology to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments. This will allow me to develop optimized models of treatment response and facilitate my long-term career goal to develop personalized treatment algorithms using large-scale data. My previous experiences in machine learning, bioengineering, neuroimaging, as well as the preliminary understanding of depression uniquely position me to maximize the benefits of training aims outlined in this proposal. 1 This is a K01 application designed to develop a data-driven machine learning model that will take into account several neural markers of response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). The application proposes expanded training in machine learning optimization approaches and depression neurobiology for the applicant, who has a PhD in Bioengineering. The goal of the study is to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments, which matches the candidate’s long-term goal to conduct research on and develop models that personalize medicine for depression. 1",Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD,10125330,K01MH122741,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Archives', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Placebos', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Universities', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'electric field', 'executive function', 'experience', 'individual patient', 'large scale data', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'support vector machine', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'voltage']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2021,170027
"Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of global disease burden. Associated with over 1,000 different symptom profiles, MDD is highly heterogeneous. The majority of MDD symptom change occurs across hours. Consequently, there is a need to increasingly focus MDD research on personalized assessment of these rapid symptom fluctuations. To date, personalized models of MDD have shown promise, but relied solely on self-report measures. There is thus a critical need to develop personalized models of MDD that incorporate objective signals. Passively collected information from smartphones and wearable sensors can continuously and unobtrusively track behavioral and physiological signals related to core disturbances associated with MDD, including psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbances, social contact, behavioral activation, heart rate variability, and screen time. Preliminary data suggest that personalized artificial intelligence (i.e., personally weighted deep learning models) are well suited for creating novel personalized digital biomarkers of these passive indicators, and that these biomarkers can predict rapid changes in MDD symptoms. This proposal will investigate the ability to develop personalized deep learning models of rapid changes in MDD symptoms among a nationally representative sample of 120 treatment seeking adults with MDD across 90 days using passively collected data from smartphones and wearable sensors. This proposal aims to test the accuracy of personalized, subtyped, and cohort-based modeling techniques and uncover personalized digital biomarkers of moment-to-moment changes in MDD symptoms. The project proposes the following innovations: it will (1) conduct the first passive-sensing study of MDD in a nationally-representative cohort; (2) utilize deep learning models to aid in the discovery of novel maintenance factors of MDD symptom changes; and (3) use personalized multimodal assessments of MDD to address the heterogeneity in MDD. In line with the aims of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this project will study MDD symptom changes across multiple units of analysis and integrate multiple systems. This study will provide a critical step towards uncovering novel personalized maintenance patterns of MDD symptom changes in daily life. Further, it will allow for scalable personalized treatments to be developed using technology to deliver behavioral interventions in the moments immediately preceding rapid MDD symptom changes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to utilize personalized artificial intelligence techniques and objective data (collected from smartphones and wearable devices) to create individualized digital biomarkers of rapid changes in major depressive disorder symptoms. This is important because, if we were to uncover personalized patterns between objectively measured physiology and behavioral changes and understand their resulting impact on rapid fluctuations in major depressive disorder symptoms, we would be able to define new, person-specific maintenance patterns that underlie the wide-ranging heterogeneity that is currently seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Moreover, these advancements will provide a crucial step forward towards developing personalized, scalable, technology-based interventions that will be able to be delivered immediately (and, ideally, before rapid symptom changes) among those persons with major depressive disorder.",Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices,10229551,R01MH123482,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Devices', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'microphone', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenomenological models', 'premature', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tv watching', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,173784
"Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is an impairing and prevalent mood disorder in adolescence, affecting 1 in 6 youth by age 18. So far, the use of conventional statistical approaches has had limited success in delivering tools for accurate individualized prediction of future depression for a specific child. The objective of this project is to build advanced non-linear machine learning algorithms integrating information from multiple sources to deliver accurate, individualized prediction. To accomplish this objective, the research team will use 5,000 variables (biological, cognitive, socio-emotional, environmental) measured on multiple occasions between the prenatal period and age 10 in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 15,636). The goal is to use features from the prenatal period to age 10 to estimate risk of reaching clinical levels of depressive symptoms between the ages of 12 and 18 years old. The research team will pursue two specific aims. The first aim is to build an algorithm for accurate prediction of adolescent depression by using informative features from the prenatal period until age 10 with machine learning methods that capture complex, multi-variate associations. The team will use several techniques, including artificial neural networks that exploit temporal information (recurrent neural networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to identify constellations of highly predictive features. Based on early-life stress sensitization theory, the first hypothesis is that features from the prenatal and early postnatal periods (up to age 5) provide greater predictive power than features from ages 6-10. The second aim is to determine if features predicting depression are unique to depression or shared with anxiety disorder and substance use disorder. Machine learning algorithms will predict age 18 clinical diagnoses of depression, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder. The team will test the second hypothesis that some predictive features will be unique for each disorder and some will be shared across all three disorder types (e.g., childhood trauma). By accomplishing these aims, the research team will devise a clinically useful algorithm to estimate a child’s probability of developing adolescent depression. All software that will be created for this project will be open-source, and made freely available online in public repositories. Algorithms that would allow accurate early identification of children at risk to develop depression during future adolescent years would provide new avenues for preemptive interventions. This would yield enormous public health benefits by prioritizing treatment and shifting developmental trajectories away from eventual disorder for millions of individuals worldwide. To realize the potential of this overall impact on the field and society, predictive models that calculate risk with high sensitivity and specificity in childhood are needed. The proposed project aims to use robust, rigorous machine learning algorithms to take on this challenge. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on depression in adolescence, which is highly prevalent and impairing during this life stage and a major risk factor for suicide. The project is relevant to NIMH’s mission because it aims to identify early behavioral and biological indicators of risk for depression in order to predict the onset of illness and support early preemptive interventions.",Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning,10108555,R21MH125346,"['18 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crude Extracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Benefit', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adverse childhood events', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'developmental psychology', 'early life stress', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'long short term memory network', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'maltreatment', 'open source', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized predictions', 'postnatal period', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'preemptive intervention', 'prenatal', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public repository', 'recurrent neural network', 'speech recognition', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2021,179604
"SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics  The current best practice guidelines for treating depression call for close monitoring of patients, and periodically adjusting treatment as needed. This project will advance personalized depression treatment by developing an innovative system, DepWatch, that leverages mobile health technologies and machine learning tools to provide clinicians objective, accurate, and timely assessment of depression symptoms to assist with their clinical decision making process. Specifically, DepWatch collects sensory data passively from smartphones and wristbands, without any user interaction, and uses simple user-friendly interfaces to collect ecological momentary assessments (EMA), medication adherence and safety related data from patients. The collected data will be fed to machine learning models to be developed in the project to provide weekly assessment of patient symptom levels and predict the trajectory of treatment response over time. The assessment and prediction results are then presented using a graphic interface to clinicians to help them make critical treatment decisions. Our project comprises two studies. Phase I collects sensory data and other data (e.g., clinical data, EMA, tolerability and safety data) from 250 adult participants with unstable depression symptomatology. The data thus collected will be used to develop and validate assessment and prediction models, which will be incorporated into DepWatch system. In Phase II, three clinicians will use DepWatch to support their clinical decision making process; a total of 50 participants under treatment by the three participating clinicians will be recruited for the study. A number of innovative machine learning techniques will be developed. These include a set of new learning formulations to construct matrix-based longitudinal predictive models, and determine the temporal contingency and the most influential features, and deep learning based data imputation methods that can handle both problems of sporadic missing data as well as missing data in an entire view. In addition, multi-task feature learning models and feature selection techniques will be expanded and refined for this challenging setting of large-scale heterogeneous data. The project is highly relevant to public and global health because it will provide a significant step forward in providing effective and patient-centric care in treating depression. It will help personalize depression treatment by identifying patients who are failing treatments early and will assist providers to take necessary actions before patients drop out of treatment.",SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics ,10196980,R01MH119678,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Drops', 'Early treatment', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Family', 'Formulation', 'Health Technology', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'data de-identification', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'feature selection', 'global health', 'heterogenous data', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2021,245551
"Validating of Machine Learning-Based EEG Treatment Biomarkers in Depression SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching aim of Alto Neuroscience is to advance brain-based biomarkers for psychiatric disorders in order to both optimize treatment pathways and drive the development of novel pharmacological and non- pharmacological interventions. Alto does this by developing and applying sophisticated machine learning computational models to electroencephalography (EEG) data collected at scale in real-world clinical treatment contexts. Specifically, in this direct-to-phase II SBIR proposal we will refine, and then independently validate, two EEG-based candidate biomarkers we have identified for stratifying patients with depression in a manner that both factors biological heterogeneity and informs treatment response. One of our biomarkers was derived in a “top-down” (i.e. supervised) manner by trying to directly predict treatment outcome, while the other biomarker presents a complimentary “bottom-up” (i.e. unsupervised) approach that begins by first identifying the most biologically homogeneous subset of patients and then testing the treatment relevance of the subtyping. Together, these findings represent very robust individual patient-level treatment-relevant EEG biomarkers, and in both cases, help define a critically-important objective approach to prospectively identifying and treating treatment- resistant depressed patients. A successful outcome of the proposed work would yield the first FDA-cleared biomarkers for stratifying psychiatric conditions. It would also provide a basis for targeted development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions based on the EEG biomarkers. Both outcomes hold substantial commercial value and exciting potential for transforming psychiatry.

"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal care provided to the pregnant members of a large regional healthcare system.",Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App,10111569,R21MH119450,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disclosure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure to Thrive', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Psychometrics', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'fetal', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'motherhood', 'natural language', 'patient subsets', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'pregnant', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'routine screening', 'smartphone Application', 'social culture', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,194684
"Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders in youth are highly prevalent [1] and impairing [2-4]. Left untreated, these disorders confer substantial additional risk for the development of a wide range of negative sequelae, including substance use [5], suicidal ideation and attempts [6], and additional mental health comorbidities [7]. Although several treatments have demonstrated efficacy for anxiety in youth, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), medication (MED), and combination of CBT and medication (COMB) [8], a meaningful portion of youth are classified as non-responders after a full course of treatment [9]. The identification of baseline predictors and moderators of response is critical to improve treatment efficacy and reduce burden on families. Increased anxiety severity, comorbidity (behavioral problems, depression), and family psychopathology, along with older age, female gender and anxiety diagnosis, have been highlighted as potential predictors and moderators of outcome. However, studies have been underpowered and findings are inconsistent [10]. To date, all studies have taken a traditional analytic approach, which typically provides conservative estimates as a result of imposed explanatory constraints [11]. Machine Learning (ML) represents a promising complementary statistical technique to traditional analyses, given its focus on predictive fit rather than explanatory inference [12] and will facilitate identification of non-linear, complex patterns of predictors and moderators at the individual level [13, 14]. These methods have shown promise in identification of treatment outcome predictors in other medical [e.g., 15-18] and psychiatric samples [e.g., 19-22], but to date have not been implemented in a sample of anxious youth. The proposed project will aggregate datasets from at minimum ten peer-reviewed and published randomized controlled trials (N=1444) and train and validate two models along overlapping features, including (1) demographics, (2) diagnosis, (3) anxiety severity (4) behavioral problems, and (5) family psychopathology. Models will also be used to examine differential response to ICBT, FCBT, MED and COMB. Aggregated data will be uploaded into a centralized dataset, in line with the NIMH RDoC db and NDAR [23] datasets, and then used to predict outcome for individual anxious youth (N=80) completing ICBT and COMB at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple. The aims of this study are consistent with calls issued in the NIMH strategic plan (Objective 3) and will help facilitate the development of person-centered interventions for anxious youth [24]. An individualized approach to treatment is important to further increase treatment efficacy and reduce the financial and emotional burden associated with non-response [25, 26]. A training plan has been designed that consists of mentorship, formal classwork and experiential learning to develop the applicant's expertise in machine learning and dataset aggregation. The proposed study will take place within Temple University's clinical psychology program, which has a successful track record of conducting impactful NIMH-funded research and training research scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although several efficacious treatments have been identified for youth anxiety, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment response and this heterogeneity is poorly understood. To help clarify differences in treatment response and facilitate the development of person-centered interventions, novel and advanced statistical approaches should be implemented using adequately powered datasets. The proposed study will (1) use machine-learning methods to identify predictors and moderators of outcome in an aggregated dataset of at minimum ten Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining youth anxiety treatments (individual and family cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and combination treatments), (2) create a centralized dataset of aggregated RCTs to foster continued cross-site collaboration and (3) test the model's predictive accuracy at the individual level in a real-world sample.",Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth,10300427,F31MH123038,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Youth', 'active method', 'anxiety treatment', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'childhood anxiety', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'demographics', 'depression model', 'design', 'efficacious treatment', 'expectation', 'family burden', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individual variation', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'parental role', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'social anxiety', 'treatment response']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2021,33247
"Positive valence systems engagement during social reward exposure psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  The proposed K23 Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is designed to provide the candidate with the conceptual knowledge and technical skills needed for a career of an independent investigator focused on the engagement of behavioral and neural network targets during personalized psychotherapies for mid- and late depression. The candidate will conduct her training and research activities at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry.  The proposal is based on the premise that identifying specific behavioral and neural network targets can guide development of streamlined interventions with potential for broad scalability and reach. “Engage”, a streamlined therapy for late-life depression, whose principal intervention is “reward exposure”, may change Positive Valence Systems (PVS) functions. Preliminary studies by the candidate show that early increase in resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of PVS structures during “Engage” predicts increased behavioral activation. Additionally, compared to solitary pleasant activities, exposure to rewarding social interactions during “Engage” leads to greater increase in behavioral activation and reduction of depression severity. Finally, a machine learning analysis conducted by the candidate showed that low perceived social support is the strongest predictor of poor response early in psychotherapy. These findings are in line with animal and human studies demonstrating the protective role of social rewards. Based on these observations, the candidate developed “Engage-S”, a social-reward based version of “Engage”, aimed to increase exposure to meaningful social interactions with others.  The training study proposes to examine whether social reward exposure in “Engage-S” enhances PVS abnormalities and improves mid- and late-life depression. The participants will be 60 middle-aged and older adults (age ≥ 50) with major depression who will be randomized to 9-weeks of “Engage-S” or to a Symptom Review and Psychoeducation (SRP) comparison condition. During treatment, we will examine target engagement of the PVS with rsFC, a behavioral activation scale (BADS), and performance on a novel social reward paradigm at baseline, 5 weeks, and 9 weeks. We will use computational methods to identify neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with treatment response.  The training plan consists of formal courses, structured tutorials, and hands-on methodological training that will offer the candidate knowledge and skills in: 1) Functional neuroanatomy of depression and aging; 2) Use of fMRI to assess target engagement during psychotherapies for mid- and late-life depression; 3) Computational modeling for the identification of clinical and neuroimaging predictors of treatment response that can be used to personalize psychotherapy; and 4) Generate preliminary data for an R-series experimental therapeutics target engagement application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Abnormalities in the Positive Valence System (PVS) are associated with depressive symptoms and reduced behavioral activation in mid- and late-life. This study will investigate the engagement of the PVS during exposure to social rewards, part of a novel streamlined psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression. Use of computational modeling will enable identification of neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with greater treatment response, and may guide future personalization of psychotherapy.",Positive valence systems engagement during social reward exposure psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression,10191051,K23MH123864,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positive Valence', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'base', 'biosignature', 'career', 'career development', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'evidence base', 'financial incentive', 'geriatric depression', 'geriatric major depression', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'middle age', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'psychoeducation', 'random forest', 'response', 'reward circuitry', 'skills', 'social', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2021,191063
"Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. Despite efforts to characterize the pathophysiology of PTSD and its heterogenity, no objective biomarker have been established to aid in diagnosis, and prediction of treatment response. This K01 presents a program for research and training that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an independent investigator, focused on utilizing a data-driven computational approach and machine learning techniques to identify multimodal neural biomarkers of PTSD (supervised) and multimodal biotypes of PTSD (unsupervised) and explore whether such biotypes could be used to predict response to prolonged exposure (PE), the first line treatment for PTSD. The training plan builds on the candidate’s prior training and experience and capitalizes on a mentorship team and a research environment to foster development of the candidate’s expertise in 1) the neural and behavioral basis of PTSD and anxiety disorders; 2) multimodal data fusion analysis and latent dimension interpretation with data-driven computational approaches and data reproducibility; and 3) patient-oriented translational research in anxiety disorders. This research project will apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques on multimodal MRI data from the largest existing PTSD dataset (N~3000 from the ENIGMA-PTSD working group). Biotypes identified from this large dataset will then be extended to clinical treatment data. The results of the proposed research will be vital to aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets and will lead to a future R01 grant examining brain-symptoms association across anxiety and trauma-related disorders, and to use the newly identified PTSD biotypes to inform different treatment outcomes in a following R61/33. Together, the research and training experiences and expertise developed through this K01 award will support the applicant’s transition to research independence and ensure the applicant becomes a leading authority in the application of data-driven computational approaches in psychiatry research, and provide the basis for future NIMH grants to explore biotypes from multimodal brain imaging using data-driven computational approaches across anxiety-related disorders. PTSD can occur after a direct or indirect traumatic experience and is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. This research project use a big data and data-driven approaches to study the heterogenity of PTSD. In the long term, this line of research will aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets, which will advance the development of effective diagnostics and treatments for PTSD.",Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study,10127376,K01MH122774,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'associated symptom', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'comorbidity', 'data fusion', 'design', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'individualized medicine', 'large datasets', 'memory process', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development', 'trauma exposure', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment research', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning', 'working group']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2021,176916
"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care. This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.",Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care,10207414,R44MH116751,"['17 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Moods', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Qualitative Research', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Specialist', 'Specialty Boards', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'checkup examination', 'child depression', 'control trial', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'programs', 'recruit', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'skills', 'success', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,507941
"Mechanisms and Predictors of Change in App-Based Mindfulness Training for Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract Mindfulness-based smartphone apps have surged in popularity in recent years. Headspace – among the most popular of these platforms – has over 42 million users. Recent surveys indicate that 11% of U.S. adolescents have used mindfulness apps as a means of coping with anxiety or depressive symptoms, which increase substantially during the adolescent years. A growing body of research implicates rumination as being a transdiagnostic risk factor involved in the development of depression and anxiety in youth. Critically, mindfulness meditation has shown significant promise in targeting rumination, and ultimately improving depressive and anxiety symptoms. Mindfulness apps offer a convenient and cost-effective means for accessing mindfulness training, while being interactive and engaging for youth. Despite their growing popularity among teens, strikingly little research has been conducted on these apps. Two critical questions have yet to be addressed, which are strongly aligned with the NCCIH Strategic Plan: (1) what are the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of these apps and (2) for whom is app-based mindfulness well-suited. To address these gaps, adolescents (ages 13-18) will be randomly assigned to an app-delivered mindfulness course vs. an active control condition and will complete pre- and post-intervention resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to probe static and dynamic functional connectivity within – and between – brain networks strongly implicated in mindfulness training and rumination (i.e., Default Mode Network and Salience Network). In addition, cognitive tasks will be administered at pre- and post-intervention to assess attentional control abilities putatively enhanced by mindfulness training. Finally, mindfulness skills and changes in rumination will be assessed via a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol developed in the PI’s lab. First, we will test whether changes in (1) brain functional connectivity, (2) attentional control and (3) acquisition and use of mindfulness skills mediate between-group (i.e., app vs. control) differences in the reduction of rumination. Second, we will test whether a machine learning model incorporating baseline clinical, demographic, and psychosocial characteristics can be used to identify which adolescents are predicted to benefit from app-based mindfulness training. Recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting outcome at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Ultimately, such an algorithm may inform individual risk-benefit assessments that could be used to objectively communicate the probability of experiencing positive vs. adverse outcomes to users prior to engaging with a mindfulness app. Collectively, results are expected to advance (1) our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of app-based mindfulness training and (2) our ability to predict which adolescents are well-suited to these increasingly popular apps. Project Narrative Mindfulness-based smartphone apps have surged in popularity in recent years (e.g., the Headspace app has over 42 million users). An estimated 11% of U.S. adolescents have used mindfulness apps as a means of coping with symptoms of depression and anxiety, which increase substantially during the adolescent years, and which have been repeatedly linked to rumination in youth. The research activities of the proposed R01 will investigate the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of these apps on rumination, and a machine learning algorithm will be developed to predict which specific adolescents are expected to benefit from app-based mindfulness training.",Mechanisms and Predictors of Change in App-Based Mindfulness Training for Adolescents,10207235,R01AT011002,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Brain', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotions', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mindfulness Training', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Panic', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk-Benefit Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Work', 'Youth', 'active control', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'anxiety symptoms', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'depressive symptoms', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness meditation', 'neuromechanism', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'post intervention', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'smartphone Application']",NCCIH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,660856
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,10051424,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'algorithm development', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,532914
"Predicting populations at-risk of developing pathological hoarding ABSTRACT Hoarding Disorder (HD), recognized as an independent illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for less than a decade, is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts. Emerging data shows that hoarding severity correlates with substantial medical burden. Prevalence of clinically significant hoarding behavior is estimated to be between 2 and 4%, with a higher burden in the older population. However, it is believed that hoarding disorder is underdiagnosed. The parent R01MH117114 combines in-person clinical, neuropsychological, and medical frailty assessments with a unique epidemiologic resource, the online Brain Health Registry (BHR) 17, to assess the extent of disability in older adults suffering with hoarding symptoms. To date, over 24,000 subjects have taken hoarding-related questionnaires. In addition, 1554 participants have completed additional surveys performed for validation of hoarding symptoms. Moreover, the BHR includes longitudinal objective and subjective measures of cognition, as well as childhood and medical history. We will classify longitudinal trends of measures of hoarding symptomatology in a subpopulation of the BHR with clinical assessments of hoarding disorders and other psychopathologies. We will then project the whole BHR population to classify longitudinal trends. We will then apply statistical inference and techniques from artificial intelligence to identify predictors of various trends of hoarding symptomatology to find predictors of developing severe hoarding symptoms. Ongoing recruitment through the parent R01 will allow for validation of the predictions made through this work. Moreover, as there is a rapid increase in the number of psychiatric studies using web-based data collection methods rather than in-person clinical assessments, the importance of studying the temporal trends and fidelity of these data collection methods extends beyond the scope of the current study. The present study will provide a proof-of-concept approach for analyzing such data.  The work will be carried out by a trained mathematician transitioning into systems medicine whose career goal is to establish an independent career in the field of computational psychiatry. The training provided through this grant will prepare the supplement candidate to submit an independent K01 award on the interactions between late life depression and hoarding disorder to the National Institute of Mental Health. This will be done by providing tailored mentoring by experts in hoarding disorder and systems medicine, access to unique datasets related to various psychopathologies, structured training in grant writing and responsible conduct in research, a structured course in psychopathology, and premier computational resources at the University of Florida. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hoarding Disorder (HD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts characterized by difficulty discarding seemingly worthless objects.

"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,10067383,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,765655
"Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression DESCRIPTION: Over the past decades, antidepressants and psychotherapy have been the first-line treatments for LLD. Despite being safe and well-tolerated, a large number of patients do not achieve full and persistent remission after initial treatment. About 50% of patients with LLD do not respond after two antidepressant trials, meeting the consensus definition of treatment resistance (TR-LLD). The persistence of chronic and elevated depressive symptoms in older adults has significant clinical and public health implications. This has been correlated to poor general health, reduced quality of life, and a higher risk of mortality when compared to those with sustained remission after treatment. Despite the relevance to public health of TR-LLD, there is little information about the biological mechanisms and no robust clinical prediction model to evaluate at the outset of antidepressant therapy who will or will not respond to treatment. Leveraging an NIMH funded clinical trial, the Incomplete Response in Late-Life Depression: Getting to Remission” (IRL-GREY), across 3 sites, in this study, we propose to evaluate the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression and to develop a machine learning based algorithm for prediction of treatment response in these subjects. We will carry out a comprehensive, multiplexed proteomic analysis on 542 samples from patients who completed phase 1 and phase 2 of the clinical trial. We hypothesise that ageing-related biological pathways (i.e. inflammatory response control, proteostasis control, cell damage response, endothelial function) will be associated with poorer treatment response in LLD. Moreover, we hypothesize that a machine learning derived biomarker panel will have sensitivity and specificity greater than 80% to predict treatment response in LLD. Finally, we will evaluate the biological mechanisms related to different depressive symptoms trajectories after treatment. This work will set the stage for a biologically-driven model of treatment response that will be useful to guide, at the outset of antidepressant treatment, those who will benefit more from a specific treatment. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting depression and reduce suffering for large numbers of elderly and their families. Using advanced molecular approaches, we will determine the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression. Our proposed study will also develop a predictive tool combining neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and protein data to identify who with late-life depression is more likely to have no benefit from antidepressant treatment at the outset of therapy. The goal of the study is to clarify the mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression, and whether we can effectively identify those who will benefit from antidepressant therapy at the outset of treatment.",Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression,10129431,R01MH118311,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Disease remission', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'aripiprazole', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proteostasis', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'venlafaxine']",NIMH,CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH,R01,2021,490569
