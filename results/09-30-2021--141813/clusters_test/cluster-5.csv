"Meeting the Challenges of COVID-19 by Expanding the Reach of Palliative Care: Proactive Advance Care Planning with Videos for the Elderly and all Patients with Dementia The majority of patients aged 65 or over, and patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), have never communicated their preferences to clinicians or completed advance care planning (ACP) documents. Palliative care has the potential to improve ADRD care, improve patient-clinician communication and patient-centered outcomes, while decreasing unwanted burdensome treatments and improving care at the end of life. The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has acutely escalated the importance of integrating ACP and palliative care services into medical care. The default response to critical illness for patients with ADRD (and all others) is intubation, mechanical ventilation, and aggressive care despite having no change in mortality outcome. ADRD patients and their caregivers may prefer to avoid these interventions.  To address these gaps, we have developed a COVID-19 ACP Educator-led, video-assisted palliative care intervention to improve patient-clinician communication, increase ACP documentation, and lead to more patient-centered care at the end of life. We will identify all hospitalized patients aged 65 and older, and any patient with ADRD, and then an ACP Educator will proactively proceed with primary palliative care services of ACP, leveraging certified video decision aids that we have developed. The ACP Educator to be tested in this proposal represents a new role and proactive function for the palliative care team. The ACP Educator, who will be a palliative care nurse, will work with older patients or patients with ADRD and proxy decision-makers to learn about and document patients' wishes.  The overall objective is to reduce the burden of COVID-19 by expanding the reach of inpatient palliative care, especially for patients with ADRD. We propose to conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of an ACP Educator intervention among hospitalized patients aged 65 and over, or any patient with ADRD and their proxy decision-makers in the ward and ICU settings of two major hospitals: Boston Medical Center and North Shore University Hospital. Patient outcomes will be abstracted from electronic health records with Natural Language Processing. We will evaluate intervention effectiveness by comparing the following outcomes among 9,000 hospitalized patients: ACP documentation; preferences for resuscitation; palliative care consults; and, hospice use. We will characterize caregiver-centered outcomes of patients with ADRD, including: (1) knowledge, (2) confidence in future care, (3) communication satisfaction, and (4) decisional certainty in 600 caregivers of patients with ADRD admitted to the hospital. COVID-19 poses a unique dilemma for older Americans and patients with ADRD and their caregivers, who must balance their desire to live against the risk of a lonely and potentially traumatic hospital death. Video decision support is a practical, evidence- based, and innovative approach to assist patients facing such choices. If proven effective, this innovative care model can be immediately deployed across the country to improve the quality of care for millions of Americans. The majority of patients aged 65 or over, and patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), have never communicated their preferences to clinicians or completed advance care planning (ACP) documents. The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has acutely escalated the importance of integrating ACP and palliative care services into medical care. We aim to improve ACP with an ACP Educator who will promote ACP conversations with certified video decision aids in a model of care that is practical, scalable, and evidence-based, has the potential to mitigate communication barriers related to health literacy and limited English proficiency, and has the potential to improve the quality of medical care delivered to millions of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Meeting the Challenges of COVID-19 by Expanding the Reach of Palliative Care: Proactive Advance Care Planning with Videos for the Elderly and all Patients with Dementia,10251623,R01AG072911,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Boston', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communication', 'Communication Barriers', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Limited English Proficiency', 'Loneliness', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Palliative Care Nursing', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Proxy', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'University Hospitals', 'Work', 'aged', 'care systems', 'compare effectiveness', 'dementia care', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health literacy', 'hospice environment', 'human old age (65+)', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'older patient', 'palliative', 'pandemic disease', 'patient-clinician communication', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'visual information', 'ward']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,2487017
"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data. Findings from this research will improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to reduce costs and help this vulnerable population.",Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases,10224085,R01AG060086,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Case Series', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Clinical', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Elder Abuse', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Victimization', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abuse victim', 'adjudicate', 'aged', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'convict', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'health economics', 'hospital utilization', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intimate partner violence', 'legal cases', 'maxillofacial', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'statistics']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,485426
"Human-Machine Collaborations to Improve Prognosis and Clinical Decision-Making in Advanced Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advance care planning and palliative care represent evidence-based, high-quality care for patients with advanced cancer. Early identification of patients at risk of short-term mortality is a promising strategy to increase advance care planning and palliative care. However, this is limited by prognostic inaccuracy among oncology clinicians, who overestimate prognosis for 70% of their patients with advanced cancer. While recent advances in electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure and machine learning (ML) have allowed accurate identification of patient' mortality risk, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how to integrate ML prognostic algorithms alongside clinician intuition (“human-machine collaborations”) in the routine care of patients with cancer. Dr. Parikh's research objective is to develop and test human-machine collaborative systems that leverage ML algorithms to improve clinicians' prognostic accuracy in order to prompt earlier advance care planning and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. In prior work, Dr. Parikh has prospectively validated and embedded into the EHR an automated ML algorithm to predict short-term mortality risk among patients with cancer. In this application, Dr. Parikh proposes to take a fundamental next step in this work by exploring strategies to improve prognostic accuracy and decision-making among oncologists treating patients with advanced cancer. In Aim 1, Dr. Parikh will retrain and validate the existing ML mortality risk prediction algorithm by integrating recently-available patient-generated health data. In Aim 2, Dr. develop prognostic that Parikh will a vignette-based survey to assess optimal strategies of presenting ML predictions to improve accuracy. He will administer this survey to a large national sample of medical oncologists to ensure clinician perspectives are incorporated into interventions.In Aim 3, Dr. Parikh will develop two models of human-machine collaborative systems to generate real-time mortality estimates that integrate clinician and algorithm predictions. In a pragmatic multi-institutional clinical trial among patients with advanced cancer, Dr. Parikh will test the impact of human-machine collaborations on prognostic accuracy and rates of advanced care planning and palliative care referral. These findings will have important implications for patients with cancer, their caregivers, oncology clinicians, and health systems. More broadly, the methods proposed may serve as a blueprint to develop and evaluate human-machine collaborations in oncology. This facilitate judgment highly-qualified Dr. development improving research will t raining in areas vital to Dr. Parikh's career goals: dvanced predictive modeling, survey methods and and decision-making, human-machine interfaces, and pragmatic clinical trials. Dr. Parikh has two and committed mentors: Dr. Justin Bekelman, an expert i n cancer care delivery r esearch, and Jinbo Chen, an expert in EHR-based predictive model development. The proposed research and career plan will enable Dr. Parikh to transition to an independent physician-scientist devoted to the quality and applicability of predictive analytics in the care of patients with cancer. a PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because we aim to improve prognostication for patients with advanced cancer by developing frameworks to integrate clinician intuition with machine learning algorithm- based mortality risk predictions (“human-machine collaborations”), a critical step to better identify patients who may benefit from earlier advance care planning and palliative care. This research proposal will optimize an existing machine learning mortality risk prediction algorithm and methodologically assess strategies to present machine learning estimates to clinicians in order to increase prognostic accuracy, advance care planning, and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. The project is relevant to the NCI's mission by generating fundamental knowledge to inform clinicians, researchers, and policymakers about effective methods to improve and integrate predictive algorithms into clinical practice, thereby allowing better targeting of evidence-based interventions to improve quality of life for patients with advanced cancer.",Human-Machine Collaborations to Improve Prognosis and Clinical Decision-Making in Advanced Cancer,10284721,K08CA263541,"['Advance Care Planning', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Jail', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Rain', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care service organization', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human model', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'outcome forecast', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk prediction', 'routine care']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,231174
"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,10176558,R01HL142503,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Air', 'American', 'Asthma', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drops', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weather', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'asthmatic patient', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care costs', 'computer science', 'cost', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,775715
"Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury Abstract Care partners of persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often required to assume a caregiver role, bearing primary responsibility for assisting the person with TBI in physical, mental, financial, and leisure activities. As a result of these new caregiving responsibilities, it is common for these care partners to report problems with physical, mental, and social health, as well as compromised health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Given that care partners’ well-being and functioning affects both their own personal health outcomes, as well as the functional and rehabilitation outcomes of the person with TBI, there is a critical need to develop novel health management interventions to ensure better health outcomes for both members of the TBI care partnership dyad. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve the health and well-being of these care partners, as well as their ability to provide care to their loved one. Thus, the proposed randomized control trial will examine the efficacy of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), or personalized self-management intervention that uses objective mobile sensor data feedback to improve physical activity, sleep, and HRQOL in 240 care partners of persons with TBI. Our primary objectives are to: 1) assess the efficacy of this novel personalized self-management intervention (i.e., JITAI) for preventing the development of adverse symptoms (e.g., mobility, sleep, poor HRQOL); and 2) use data collected from wearables (i.e., the Fitbit Charge®) and real-time assessments of HRQOL to identify care partners with the greatest risk for negative physical and mental HRQOL outcomes, as well as the timing for when they are at greatest risk. We expect care partners that are randomized to receive the JITAI will demonstrate improvements in HRQOL, physical activity and sleep relative to controls. We also hypothesize is that objective, data-derived mobile phenotypes can predict risk for adverse caregiver HRQOL. The scientific premise for the proposed research is based on our multidisciplinary team with expertise in caregiver research, evaluation of HRQOL using patient-reported outcomes, clinical trials implementation, expertise in real time assessment of HRQOL, as well as the statistical expertise in high- dimensional statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, the innovation is grounded in the examination of a real-time, real-world, personalized and scalable JITAI designed to improve HRQOL in care partners. Ultimately, this study will allow us to identify care partners at the greatest risk for negative physical and mental health outcomes, and will provide important efficacy data to support the clinical utility of a low cost, low burden self-management intervention to improve HRQOL for care partners of persons with TBI. Narrative Care partners of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often faced with considerable physical and emotional stress resulting from their caregiver role; not surprisingly, this stress is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes for both the care partner and the person for whom they provide care. Given this, interventions focused on improving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these care partners will likely have positive downstream effects for the care recipient. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a personalized self-management intervention designed to promote care partner self-care; this intervention uses physical activity and sleep data collected using a Fitbit® and real-time self-reports of HRQOL collected via a mobile phone app, to provide care partners with personalized feedback via app alert four times per week.",Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury,10110031,R01NR013658,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Beds', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Emotional Stress', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Financial Activity', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Leisure Activities', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care recipients', 'care systems', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'clinical trial implementation', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'fitbit', 'functional outcomes', 'group intervention', 'health assessment', 'health management', 'health related quality of life', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loved ones', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'poor sleep', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sleep health', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tv watching']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,592501
"Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients with Serious Illness Although discussions that address patients' goals of care are one of the most important aspects of palliative care, this communication is often lacking in our healthcare system. Goals-of-care communication is associated with improved patient and family outcomes and reduced intensity of care at the end of life. Electronic health records (EHR) provide a key opportunity to identify patients who would benefit from these discussions and to promote these discussions, yet prior interventions have not used the EHR for this purpose.  Older adults with chronic illness, and particularly those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), are especially vulnerable to inappropriately intensive end-of-life care. To address this shortcoming, we build on two of our most successful programs, one using the EHR to identify goals-of-care discussions and the other a novel intervention called Jumpstart that promotes and enhances these discussions. We will examine the effectiveness of the Jumpstart intervention for hospitalized older adults with chronic illness and specifically oversample those with ADRD to understand the effectiveness of the intervention in this key group.  We propose 2 linked, complementary randomized trials. Trial 1, a pragmatic trial, compares usual care with a clinician-facing Jumpstart for hospitalized older adults with serious illness (n=2000). Trial 2, a comparative effectiveness trial, compares this clinician-facing Jumpstart with a bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart based on surveys completed by patients or family members (n=400). We hypothesize that the clinician-facing Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to usual care, and the bi-directional, patient- specific Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart. We use an innovative hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach to accomplish 3 aims. Aim 1 evaluates the effectiveness of the clinician-facing Jumpstart, compared with usual care, for improving quality of care; the primary outcome is EHR documentation of a goals-of-care discussion during the hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include intensity of care at the end of life. Aim 2 evaluates the effectiveness of the bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart; the primary outcome is the same as Trial 1. We will examine the same secondary outcomes, but also include patient- and family-reported outcomes assessed by surveys at 1 and 3 months after randomization including occurrence and quality of goals-of-care communication in the hospital, goal-concordant care, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and palliative care needs. We will also examine costs of care after accounting for costs of the interventions. In Aim 3, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators to future implementation and dissemination.  Our team has experience conducting innovative multi-center trials with patient-centered outcomes, economic analyses, and implementation science. This novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach addresses key knowledge gaps to improve the quality and value of care for older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Communication about goals of care is one of the most important aspects of palliative care for older adults, yet the lack of this communication is a major shortcoming in our healthcare system. We propose 2 linked and innovative randomized trials to evaluate a novel intervention that promotes and enhances goals-of-care discussions for hospitalized patients with serious chronic illness. We hypothesize the intervention will improve outcomes for older patients with chronic illness and their family members and will be effective in the expanding subset of these patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.",Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients with Serious Illness,10143159,R01AG062441,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic Visits', 'Communication', 'Consensus', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Randomized', 'Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance', 'Reporting', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'base', 'care costs', 'care outcomes', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'economic evaluation', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'effectiveness implementation study', 'efficacy evaluation', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation evaluation', 'implementation framework', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention cost', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older patient', 'palliative', 'patient subsets', 'patient-clinician communication', 'pragmatic trial', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychological symptom', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'symposium', 'treatment as usual', 'trial comparing']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,777399
"Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating effect on our elderly population living in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes. In particular, care for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) is extremely challenging due to their special needs and difficulty adhering to social distancing requirements. This administrative supplement under the Stanford Aging and Ethogeriatrics (SAGE) Research Center (P30 AG059307) will examine the emotional distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on dementia risk in racial minorities. Aim 1 will examine the extent to which COVID-19-imposed emotional distress mediates the association between childhood social distress and late-life increased risk of dementia by race. Aim 2 will examine the mental health and coping strategies of aging minority residents in nursing homes during the COVID- 19 pandemic by recruiting respondents in nursing homes in selected segregated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMAs). These results are expected to shed new light on the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating the effects of emotional distress on minorities living with dementia and how coping strategies may help to mitigate that risk and the provision of dementia care. Our results from both Aims will be integrated and complement each other by providing robust statistical evidence on the association between stress and ADRD as well as first-hand evidence and perspectives from residents and caregivers, who are currently at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Project Narrative: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely taking an enormous toll on the mental health of elderly minority patients and their caregivers in long-term care facilities. The results of this administrative supplement project will provide significant insights into the emotional impact of the pandemic on patients with Alzheimer’s and related dementias and ultimately lead to the design of more effective coping strategies for handling stressful events and improve the overall provision of care.",Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE),10268030,P30AG059307,"['Accounting', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Area', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 mortality', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Late Effects', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Race', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Social Distance', 'Stress', 'Stressful Event', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'aging population', 'comorbidity', 'coping', 'coronavirus disease', 'dementia care', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'emotional distress', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care disparity', 'health economics', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial discrimination', 'racial minority', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'segregation', 'social', 'social stressor']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P30,2021,197125
"A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life ABSTRACT  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are a group of progressive, terminal illnesses that will affect an estimated 14-million people in the United States by the year 2050. Caregivers experience chronic stress and they report feeling burdened and unprepared for making difficult end-of-life (EOL) care decisions, which may lead to unnecessary hospitalizations or avoidable transitions in care that affect end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL). Advance care planning (ACP), which improves EOL-QOL, is the gold-standard approach for improving concordance between preferences and actual care received at EOL. However, despite decades of research aimed at raising their rates, only 50% of those with AD/ADRD have a written ACP. Furthermore, there is a lack of current research evidence investigating the factors associated with transitions in care and EOL-QOL for persons with AD/ADRD, which could help guide EOL decision-making. To date, the state of the science is primarily cross-sectional in nature, and does not account for the influence of trajectories of decline, the effect these changes have on caregivers, nor how longitudinal changes in caregiving ultimately affect EOL care outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need to discover new approaches for preparing persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making informed, in-the-moment decisions, to ensure high EOL-QOL care and to support appropriate transitions in care as circumstances change over time. Using the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and National Study on Caregiving (NSOC), we plan to use a machine learning based framework to identify the key determinants for predicting the risk for EOL care transitions and the traits of EOL-QOL among older adults residing in the community. This study has two specific aims: 1) Develop predictive model of factors related to end-of-life care transitions (e.g. inpatient death versus hospice) in persons with AD/ADRD longitudinally; and 2) Develop a predictive model of factors related to end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) in persons with AD/ADRD. Discovering knowledge in a large population- level dataset is foundational for the future development of a generalizable/scalable model for guiding persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers as they navigate a fragmented healthcare system while making difficult decisions for their loved ones. Our approach fills a critical gap between the current approaches for improving EOL-QOL and EOL transitions in care that focus on ACP as a singular outcome, by addressing the comprehensive needs of individuals with AD/ADRD and their caregivers that change over time. Our study will provide a predictive model for EOL-QOL and EOL care transitions. This is a critical first step for the future development of an approach for personalizing care to guide persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making EOL care decisions. These results will have an important positive impact on EOL care, which aligns with the strategic goals of the National Institutes of Aging (NIA) and Nursing Research (NINR) to address clinical and translational gaps in the study of EOL care needs of people with AD/ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are at high risk for experiencing burdensome care transitions, avoidable hospitalizations, and poor end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) due to the increasing prevalence of multiple chronic illness and escalating demands placed on caregivers, resulting in significant personal and public socioeconomic burdens. Decades of research has focused on improving the rates of advance care plans above 50% among persons with AD/ADRD, however, others may benefit more from personalized guidance to help navigate the trajectory of decline that supports timely, “in the moment” medical decision making. This study addresses Goals 2 and 3 of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease to enhance care quality and efficiency and expand support for persons with AD/ADRD by identifying factors related to poor EOL-QOL and care transitions in the context of caregiving for the future development of a personalized approach to support in the moment healthcare decision-making.",A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life,10162470,R03AG067159,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospice Care', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Terminal Disease', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States', 'Update', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'inpatient service', 'loved ones', 'novel strategies', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'secondary analysis', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend']",NIA,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R03,2021,79750
"A Multimodal Parent-focused Intervention for Vulnerable Populations in the Bronx PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In response to PAR-20-237, “community interventions to address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among health disparity and vulnerable populations,” we propose to study a parent-focused mentalizing intervention with a smartphone health platform in vulnerable populations in the Bronx. The Bronx—the poorest borough in New York City (NYC) with 84% of its population comprised of minorities—has been hit disproportionally by the COVID-19 pandemic. For caregivers in the Bronx, the pandemic has caused unprecedented psychological distress; in addition to combating social determinants of health (SDOH), these families now face greater financial insecurity and challenges related to their school-aged children. Furthermore, social distancing requirements and limited telehealth resources for Bronx families have posed greater barriers to healthcare. Such parental distress contributes to heightened risk of transgenerational cycles of psychological stress, trauma and maltreatment. Addressing these challenges, we propose a multimodal study tackling both parental vulnerability and healthcare access. a) Targeting parental vulnerability, we propose to build upon our 12-session therapeutic CARE program, which utilizes Mentalization Based Therapy and designed for parents of children in treatment in a community psychiatry clinic in our health system. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of attachment-based parenting interventions, including from our group in disadvantaged cohorts from the Bronx. b) Targeting healthcare access, we propose to utilize the HIPAA-compliant and IRB-approved Valera Health smartphone application (“app”), which has been studied in our health system in selected cohorts and resulted in greater access to healthcare. Building upon our work and clinical infrastructure, we hypothesize that both the CARE program and the Valera app will mitigate the psychological effects of COVID-19 while enhancing access to healthcare in the Bronx. The study will take place at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), the largest health system in the Bronx, which serves predominantly racial and ethnic minority individuals from underserved families. We will focus on three highly vulnerable cohorts: a) caregivers of children with psychiatric conditions (N=130); b) caregivers of children with autoimmune illnesses (N=130), and; c) caregivers who are frontline healthcare workers at MMC (N=100); all presenting with moderate stress. A RCT with 4 arms (2 x 2 design) will test our hypothesis: a) CARE program alone; b) CARE program + Valera app; c) Parent Education (PE) alone; d) PE + Valera app. Smartphones and connectivity will be provided as needed. Surveys at study enrollment, 6-, 12- and 24-weeks will assess parental stress, mentalizing capacity (reflective functioning), access to healthcare, mood and anxiety and additional parent and child clinical measures. Machine learning approaches will explore complex patterns as predictors of outcome including COVID-19 illness/deaths, medical comorbidity, housing, poverty, psychopathology, age, family functioning, and trauma. Impact. This multimodal study addresses key strategies to mitigate the psychological and health impact of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Our proposed prospective research, focusing on examining the effectiveness of both a telehealth platform and an innovative treatment approach for parents and primary caregivers as well as frontline healthcare providers who are currently experiencing unprecedented levels of perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, is expected to provide support to these highly vulnerable groups based in the Bronx who normally encounter significant barriers to basic care. If successful, the study has the potential to offset several of the negative social determinants of health typically encountered by members of these vulnerable communities. As such, the clinical implications of our proposed research are potentially profound.",A Multimodal Parent-focused Intervention for Vulnerable Populations in the Bronx,10261854,R01MH126821,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Autoimmune Process', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Psychiatry', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disadvantaged', 'Distress', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Social Distance', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cohort', 'community intervention', 'comorbidity', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy evaluation', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care availability', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'maltreatment', 'member', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'outcome prediction', 'pandemic disease', 'perceived stress', 'primary caregiver', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'racial minority', 'relative effectiveness', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'social health determinants', 'substance use treatment', 'telehealth', 'therapy design']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,50000
"Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial. Nearly half of people currently living with dementia have not received a diagnosis, delaying access to treatment as well as education and support for the patient and family. Thus, NIA has requested applications to support pragmatic clinical trials of low-cost tools to improve detection of cognitive decline in clinical settings (RFA-AG- 20-051). With pilot funding from NIA, we used machine learning to develop a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule), which uses easily accessible information in the electronic health record (EHR) to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. In addition, we interviewed patients, caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare system leaders to inform pragmatic implementation of eRADAR in clinical settings. Stakeholders felt strongly that such a tool should be implemented through primary care, in the context of existing clinical relationships, and would need to be accompanied by additional support for patients and clinicians. Our current proposal is heavily informed by this development work. In Aim 1, we will use EHR data to evaluate eRADAR's performance in different patient subgroups, including by race/ethnicity, in two healthcare systems to inform selection of cut- points for use in clinical settings. We will select an optimal cut-point to use for targeted dementia assessment with stakeholder input, balancing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. In Aim 2, we will perform a pragmatic clinical trial to determine whether implementing eRADAR as part of a supported outreach process to high-risk patients improves dementia detection. The setting will be primary care clinics within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA), an integrated healthcare delivery system in Washington State, and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), an urban, academic healthcare system with a diverse patient population. The study includes 6 clinics with ~24,000 patients age ≥65. Within each clinic, primary care providers (PCPs) will be randomly assigned to have their patients with high eRADAR scores targeted for outreach (intervention) or to usual care (control). Our clinical research staff—whose roles were designed to reflect existing roles within these healthcare systems to maximize pragmatism—will reach out to patients with high eRADAR scores, conduct an assessment for cognitive impairment, make follow-up recommendations to PCPs, and support patients after diagnosis. Patients with high eRADAR scores in both treatment arms will be followed to determine the impact of eRADAR on new diagnoses of dementia (primary outcome) as assessed from the EHR (again, to maximize pragmatism). In Aim 3, we will explore the impact of eRADAR implementation on secondary outcomes including healthcare utilization and experience of patients and family members. If this pragmatic trial is successful, the eRADAR tool and process could be spread to other healthcare systems, potentially improving detection of cognitive decline, patient care, and quality of life. Most patients with cognitive impairment are diagnosed relatively late in the disease process, and about half of people living with dementia are undiagnosed. We have developed a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule) that uses information in electronic health records to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. This study will determine whether a supported process of reaching out to patients with high eRADAR scores as part of primary care leads to earlier detection of dementia and improves patient care.","Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial.",10266125,R01AG069734,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Underweight', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'comparison intervention', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'outreach', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'usual care arm']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,903251
"Use of Predictive Analytics to Quantify Neonatal Hypothermia Burden After Cardiac Surgery ABSTRACT Neonates (infants ≤ 28 days), especially those with congenital heart disease (CHD), are among the most vulnerable populations cared for by critical care nurses. Approximately, two out of three CHD neonates experience unintentional hypothermia after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Unintentional hypothermia impairs cellular function, which can be linked to poor outcomes frequently reported in this population. To date, there are no studies examining the association between the burden of unintentional hypothermia and clinical outcomes in neonates with CHD. This knowledge would render future opportunities to improve nursing care and prevent avoidable safety events in these vulnerable neonates. To address this gap, we propose to use retrospective data from CardioAccess (database local to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia [CHOP]), which includes one of the largest multicenter repositories of neonatal cardiac surgery data available to date (Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care Consortium [PC4]), as well as, the electronic health record. Using data from at least 432 neonates who have undergone CPB between 2015 and 2019, we will quantify the time course of hourly temperature trajectories within the initial 24–48 hours after CPB and evaluate their relation to key clinical outcomes. We will specifically study the temporal trends of unintentional hypothermia burden (temperature depth and duration), which challenges current practice, where care is based on maintaining a single, preselected temperature threshold that is driven by consensus, rather than evidence. Single threshold values are not dynamic representations of the complexity that makes up temperature. A more robust output, such as an accumulative hypothermia burden index, is needed to assist clinicians with interpretation of this dynamic indicator of overall health. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Identify distinct temporal temperature patterns in CHD neonates after CPB using both: a multilevel model for intensive longitudinal data with group-based trajectory modeling; and an unsupervised machine learning technique using principal component analysis followed by k- means clustering of longitudinal data. 2) Determine the relationship between hypothermia burden subgroups / clusters and important clinical outcomes in this population. Our team has a demonstrated expertise in building clinically relevant and physiologically plausible markers of adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. This study aligns with the NINR’s priorities of promoting wellness and preventing illness across the lifespan, as well as, using recent advances in precision medicine. The research conducted under this award will take place at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing, a research-intensive institution (data analysis), and CHOP (data provision). The personalized training plan outlined in this application, supports the applicant’s career and academic development goals to become an independent nurse researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Unintentional hypothermia can significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD), which has a prevalence at birth in the USA of ~1% or 40,000 cases per year, and of those, ~6,000 neonates are born with severe defects requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery, contributing to a total cost of ~$5.6 billion every year. This will be the first clinical study to define the prevalence of unintentional hypothermia and map its association to neonatal outcomes with CHD, which has major implications for clinical practice. Unveiling the prevalence and consequences of unintentional hypothermia in this vulnerable population will render future opportunities to enhance time to recognition and early choice of preemptive intervention, which can improve the quality and safety of care, save lives and productivity, as well as, health care dollars.",Use of Predictive Analytics to Quantify Neonatal Hypothermia Burden After Cardiac Surgery,10233671,F31NR019725,"['Address', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consensus', 'Cost of Illness', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Hypoxemia', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Integumentary system', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic acidosis', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'PC4 Gene', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Philadelphia', 'Physiological', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Respiratory distress', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Safety', 'School Nursing', 'Subgroup', 'Surgical Wound Infection', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight Gain', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'critical care nursing', 'database query', 'early onset', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multilevel analysis', 'natural hypothermia', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonate', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'preemptive intervention', 'prevent', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'trend', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2021,48536
"Integrative Informatics Approach to Predict Readmissions and Improve Outcomes in COPD Project Summary This proposal for a mentored career development award consists of a training and research plan devised to facilitate Dr. David Jacobs' transition to an independent investigator focusing on the implementation of medication use interventions during the transition from hospital to home for high-needs patients. Dr. Jacobs is a clinical pharmacist with an advanced degree in epidemiology and health services and has significant experience conducting clinical research. The candidate's current research is focused on transition of care interventions. Given the resource intensive nature of these interventions, the sustainability of these programs will heavily depend on identifying and targeting patients at high-risk for hospital readmission. To anticipate such admissions, predictive models have been developed; however, our ability to predict hospital readmissions remains poor. This is likely because detailed social information, which is disproportionately represented in high-needs populations, is typically absent in risk stratification tools. Therefore, the long-term research objective is to build predictive models that combine social information with rich clinical data to individualize care management interventions and reduce readmissions. The specific aims are: (i) to determine social risk factors driving hospital readmissions by conducting semi-structured interviews with patients, their caregivers, and clinicians; (ii) to develop a risk- prediction model using advanced informatics techniques; and (iii) to develop and test the feasibility of a pilot intervention aimed at improving transition strategies. This work will focus on a singular complex condition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in developing a risk stratification tool in order to improve its predictive performance for identifying high-risk patients. COPD will serve as the model condition since it is one of the major readmission diagnoses, and there exists a high level of complexity following hospital discharge at patients' care transition. This award will provide the applicant with mentor-guided didactic and experiential learning to address the following career development objectives: 1) gain experiential learning in qualitative methodology, 2) advance his knowledge in biomedical informatics and develop predictive models integrating high-dimensional electronic health record data, and 3) increase his understanding of implementation science and gain practical experience in conducting a pragmatic clinical trial. The primary mentor, Dr. Sanjay Sethi, and the mentorship team will work closely to monitor his progress toward independence and will provide him with the guidance and the resources to guarantee his success. The proposed study leverages the extensive resources available at the University at Buffalo to address an important public health issue. Achieving the proposed aims and acquiring these advanced skills will position the candidate to submit successful R01s testing the proposed clinical prediction model and transition strategy in real-world settings. In summary, a comprehensive career development plan in the context of a well-defined training, research, and mentorship structure will allow Dr. Jacobs to emerge as a highly successful, independent clinician-investigator in health services research. Project Narrative Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are discharged from the hospital have high rates of early readmission; these readmissions are a significant burden to the health care system. The proposed research will combine social information with rich clinical data to develop a real-time readmission risk prediction algorithm that will be integrated into a patient-centric intervention and tested in real-world clinical practice settings. The information learned from this project will assist in providing individualized treatment at the transition from hospital to home and focused on reducing healthcare utilization and ultimately improving quality of care.",Integrative Informatics Approach to Predict Readmissions and Improve Outcomes in COPD,10215337,K23HL153582,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Buffaloes', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pharmacists', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Sustainability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'biomedical informatics', 'care coordination', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'health care service utilization', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient safety', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'practice setting', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'readmission rates', 'readmission risk', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'skills', 'social', 'social disadvantage', 'social factors', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NHLBI,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,K23,2021,192411
"Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record Project Summary/Abstract Sepsis is a critical illness syndrome characterized by infection leading to life-threatening organ failure. Affecting over 200,000 individuals in the United States each year, sepsis accounts for nearly half of all hospital deaths and over $20 billion in yearly US hospital costs. Despite the development and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines, most patients with sepsis do not consistently receive recommended care, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is increasing interest in implementing health policies designed to incentivize quality improvement at the hospital level. The largest and most prominent of these policies to date is the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quality reporting initiative, known as SEP-1. SEP-1 requires hospitals to report their compliance with a variety of evidence-based care processes, including timely antibiotic administration, timely volume resuscitation, and routine monitoring of the clinical response to therapy. SEP-1 is unique among quality measures in the CMS Inpatient Quality Reporting Program, both because it is the only measure based on a critical illness syndrome and because it is of unparalleled complexity, requiring the coordinated efforts of multiple health care providers across the acute care spectrum. As a consequence, it is essential to understand how SEP-1 has affected patient care and clinical outcomes. To address this need, we propose to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the SEP-1 measure using the electronic health record (EHR) of a large multihospital health system. An EHR-based approach will allow us to understand the impact of the policy in exceptional detail, yielding actionable data not only for policy makers seeking to refine SEP-1 but also for health systems seeking to respond to SEP-1 in a way that maximizes the potential benefits. First, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis recognition and documentation using natural language processing of clinical notes. Second, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis care processes using structured data elements such as vital signs, laboratory values, and medication administration. Third, we will evaluate the impact of the program on patient mortality, length of stay, and requirement for organ support. In all aims we will examine both overall effects and hospital-specific effects, providing an understanding of how hospitals and health systems implement quality improvement in the context of a novel reporting mandate. Together, these aims will yield important new insights into how clinicians and hospitals implement new quality reporting programs. At the same time, through a program of structured mentorship, career development, and stakeholder involvement, this project will provide the principal investigator with new skills in the use of the EHR to evaluate health care quality and the impact of system-level health policies, uniquely positioning him to lead future efforts to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate EHR-based performance interventions for critically ill patients. NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection and accounts for significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs in the United States. In this proposal, we will use data from the electronic health record of a large health system to evaluate the effects of a novel sepsis quality reporting program on sepsis recognition, treatment, and outcomes. Our findings will yield important early information on the quality reporting program’s impact, helping to guide policy makers as they seek to refine the program and yielding novel insights into strategies to improve sepsis quality in US hospitals.",Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record,10173872,K08HS025455,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2021,146648
"Nurse AMIE: Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday in Rural PA and WV Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with cancer who live in rural settings experience worse outcomes as compared to those in urban settings. Individuals in rural regions have difficulty accessing supportive care services due to travel challenges, cost of services, and overall lack of available supportive care resources. The latter issue likely contributes greatly to the urban/rural survival differences, given that multiple studies document that regularly addressing patient symptoms has a survival benefit in the setting of advanced cancer. Technology may provide solutions to overcome issues of rurality, however, little work has been done to specifically leverage technology- based solutions to deliver high quality supportive care in rural settings. Our team has developed and pilot tested a tablet-based symptom assessment and supportive care intervention called Nurse AMIE (Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday) that was well received by patients with metastatic cancer, including a subset of rural patients living in non-metropolitan counties (Rural Urban Continuum Code (RUCC) counties of 4 or higher). Patients were provided a tablet and cellular data plan to allow them to answer symptom questions daily, and an embedded personalized decision tree then offered evidence based self-care interventions to address the self-reported symptom with a goal of improving overall health and well-being. A pedometer and resistance band were also provided, given evidence that physical activity can assist with all four of the symptoms addressed in Nurse AMIE (fatigue, sleep, distress, and pain). These four symptoms form the basis of the psychoneurological symptom cluster that has been noted to be associated with quality of life and survival in oncology patients. Nurse AMIE can conduct symptom assessment, track data, and provide interventions offline if internet access is unavailable. Our preliminary evidence demonstrates acceptability and feasibility of the tablet-based approach as our patients logged on 57% of intervention days. Furthermore, patients using Nurse AMIE reported high patient satisfaction with the self-care system. Based on findings from the pilot, we propose to add a weekly survey similar to that from prior research by Basch et al. and Denis et al. to expand the symptom assessment aspect of the platform. We propose that this distance based supportive care intervention (Nurse AMIE) will have significant effects on rural patients overall survival (primary outcome), cancer treatment-related symptoms, function, and health related quality of life. We will focus our efforts on N=344 underserved or low-income adult men and women living in non-metropolitan counties (RUCC codes 4- 9) that have low access to supportive care. This work will be carried out with the help of a strong community advisory board, and guided by the PA and WV State Offices of Rural Health. We will enroll and randomize patients to receive the Nurse AMIE supportive care intervention or usual care. Enrollment will occur at regularly scheduled medical visits and the intervention will extend for the length of follow-up (2 years). We will also examine the cost effectiveness of Nurse AMIE. Nurse AMIE Project Narrative Rural patients with metastatic cancer are less likely to have access to high quality supportive care. This may have a negative effect on survival and well-being. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the survival benefits of a high quality technology based supportive care platform among 344 underserved, low income patients with metastatic cancer living in rural Pennsylvania or West Virginia.",Nurse AMIE: Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday in Rural PA and WV,10085516,R01CA254659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Cancer Patient', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distress', 'Enrollment', 'Fatigue', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Nurses', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Probability', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Rural Health', 'Schedule', 'Self Care', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Supportive care', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'West Virginia', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'care systems', 'common symptom', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost estimate', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'men', 'opportunity cost', 'pedometer', 'personalized decision', 'primary outcome', 'psychosocial', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'rural setting', 'rural underserved', 'rurality', 'symptom cluster', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment as usual', 'tumor', 'urban setting', 'usual care arm']",NCI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2021,656763
"Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease A growing number of older patients are living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to advances in life- prolonging technologies and the aging of the population. As CKD advances towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD), even life-prolonging technologies cannot extend life indefinitely, especially for patients who have a poor prognosis and for whom decisions about medical interventions become particularly important. Consequently, older patients with advanced CKD need to communicate with their physicians about their preferences regarding CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care (medical management of symptoms of advanced CKD without dialysis) in order to make crucial decisions impacting the length and quality of their lives. Communication surrounding medical decision making is formalized in Advance Care Planning (ACP), a process involving verbal or written information designed to inform patients of possible medical options including CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care. Traditional ACP for patients with ESRD relies on ad hoc verbal descriptions of treatment options. This approach is limited because these options are difficult to envision. We have developed a video decision aid for reviewing CPR, dialysis and non-dialytic treatment preferences in ESRD. The tool, which is available in both English and Spanish, also allows patients to video record their preferences (""video declaration"") and share their preferences with their clinicians and caregivers. The overall objective of this study is to conduct a multi-center randomized trial of the video intervention (vs. usual care) to test the hypothesis that the video better informs older persons with advanced CKD and poor prognosis of their treatment options and leads to more ACP documentation, informed decision making, and improved quality of life. We will compare ACP documentation after one year (or at time of death) among 600 patients aged 75 or older with advanced CKD and poor prognosis randomly assigned to either the video intervention or usual care (Aim 1). We will compare ESRD treatment preferences, decisional conflict, ACP engagement and conversations, and concordance of preferences stated after the video intervention or usual care with ESRD care delivery after one year (or at time of death) (Aim 2). We will explore the quality of life, longevity, and cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) associated with patients' ESRD treatment decisions in the video vs. control groups (Aim 3). We will also conduct a qualitative assessment of the video declarations as well as barriers and facilitators for intervention success (Aims 4 and 5). ESRD in older patients involves complex decision making. It is imperative that we develop and evaluate early interventions to deliver more patient- focused care to this rapidly growing segment of the population. Using videos to enhance communication offers an opportunity to improve care of this vulnerable group of patients. Video is a practical, evidence-based, and innovative approach that has the potential to improve the quality of care provided to tens of thousands of older Americans. It is imperative to develop scalable and effective approaches to supporting persons with advanced kidney disease and their family caregivers. By providing video education tools to better inform persons making decisions about medical care and offering evidence-based options for kidney care, there is an opportunity to improve quality of life throughout the care trajectory.",Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease,10144365,R01AG066892,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Aging', 'American', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Documentation', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'End stage renal failure', 'Family Caregiver', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Supportive care', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'aged', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,2122297
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

"Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management Project Summary/Abstract Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation and our partners propose to develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) system for persons with dementia (PWD),(mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or other dementias), who are living in assisted living facilities. The proposed system uses Augmented Intelligence (AI) to communicate with the PWD in natural language. The system's goals are three-fold. First, the system helps PWD transition from living in their homes to ALFs by fostering relationships and conveying schedules. Second, the system enables PWD to age in place by addressing the challenges that often lead to an escalation of care (i.e., nursing homes). Third, the system engages PWD via activities such as storytelling and simple games. We will integrate the proposed SAR system with current assistive technology, which is based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and quality of life in PWD. A strong multi-disciplinary team of engineers, academic experts in SAR and PWD, and a commercialization partner has been assembled to achieve these goals. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases affecting an estimated 5.3 million Americans at a cost of $236 billion. Social assistive robots can be used to lessen levels of depression, loneliness, grief, fear, and frustration as dementia progresses improving mental health and quality of life. In addition to improved quality of life, persons with dementia may be able to extend the amount of time in assisted living before being forced to a much costlier higher level of care such as a nursing home.",Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management,10020889,R44AG058337,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Health', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Loneliness', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'body language', 'cognitive computing', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'robot interface', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2021,1924651
"Novel, High-Impact Studies Evaluating Health System and Healthcare Professional Responsiveness to COVID-19 PROJECT SUMMARY FOR PEOPLE ARE PRIMARY Background: We are experiencing an event unlike any in living history. The global pandemic, referred to as “COVID-19”, has become a one-of-a-kind stress test on health care systems around the world. The size, scope, and speed of this pandemic has created an imperative for rapid dissemination of data and findings. The response of US primary care practices to COVID-19 is a large-scale natural experiment of the capacity of primary care to meet the majority of people's needs. And yet, at the start the pandemic in the US, there was no one organization, federal agency, or national dataset able to provide real-time on-the-ground data regarding the experiences of primary care practices or their patients. Purpose: On March 13, 2020, as the US declared COVID-19 a national emergency, our team created a national research Collaboratory and launched the “Quick COVID-19 Primary Care Survey” (C19 Survey) to fill that gap. The Pilot C19 Survey began as a clinician-based weekly national survey to monitor the response, challenges, and capacity of US primary care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. After 4 weeks, we launched a complementary patient-based C19 Survey. People Are Primary would allow the C19 Surveys to continue beyond the Pilot stage. We will examine the responses, challenges, and capacity of primary care practices in order to evaluate the resilience and adaptive decision- making required during the pandemic. Drawing on both patients and clinicians, we will examine the rapid adoption of digital health by primary care as well as the positive and negative consequences of digital health on 1) access to care across varied settings, 2) patient and clinician care delivery experiences, and 3) the interaction of digital health with relationships between primary care patients and primary care teams. Methods: This is a mixed-methods learning evaluation with an exploratory sequential design. Regular surveys will be distributed to identified clinician and patient groups throughout the 2-year study period. These will begin weekly and will evolve into biweekly and then monthly surveys in response to changes in the natural evolution of the pandemic and subsequent primary care practice response. The research team will engage in weekly rapid learning cycles that complete data collection, analysis, dissemination, and adjustment to survey instrument within a 7-day period. The team will also use bimonthly deep learning cycles to develop time series and trend- based analysis, offering a more extended conversation of these findings and their implications for the long-term stability and strengthening of the US primary care platform. Benefit: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the costs of chronic and fragmented under-investment in primary care. Examination of the rapid adoption of digital health and its impact on patient and clinician experiences of care during the pandemic can inform a much needed strategy to 1) stop the immediate threat of primary care collapse, 2) identify practice and funding strategies able to stabilize primary care practices, and 3) enable the long term strengthening of primary care.

Examination of digital health and its impact on patient and clinician experiences of care during the pandemic can inform a much-needed strategy to 1) stop the immediate threat of primary care collapse, 2) identify practice and funding strategies able to stabilize primary care practices, and 3) enable the long term strengthening of primary care.","Novel, High-Impact Studies Evaluating Health System and Healthcare Professional Responsiveness to COVID-19",10193445,R01HS028253,[' '],AHRQ,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,491317
"Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the future of healthcare availability and quality of services seems uncertain, at the same time advances in pervasive computing and intelligent embedded systems provides innovative strategies to meet these needs. One particular need which technology can help address is assessment and assistance with a person's functional performance. The long-term goal of this work is to develop technologies that will improve the independent functioning and quality of life of individuals with functional limitations (particularly individuals with ADRDs) and reduce their reliance on caregivers. The primary objective of this application is to develop a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and assistance with everyday activities. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach will be to collect and fuse multi-modal functional performance data from ambient sensors, mobile sensors, free text, and assessment apps (Aim 1). This fused “human behaviorome” will provide a basis, together with observation-based ground truth, for automated functional assessment and validation of each component technology, including the use of compensatory strategies, through in-person observation and through video recording of typical daily activities and strategies (Aim 2). Finally, using iterative, user-centered assessment of prompt-based assistance, we will evaluate the ability of activity segmentation and forecasting techniques to provide automated support for activity initiation and accurate completion of everyday activities (Aim 3). The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on functional health revealed within a person's everyday environment that have not been investigated in prior work. The results can also help to extend functional independence through real-time assistance, while the outcomes can assist family planning, provision of care, and design of real-world and lab-based measures of functional performance. This work is important because of the increasing number of older individuals experiencing cognitive and functional limitations due to chronic health conditions. Furthermore, they address the need for individuals to remain functionally independent as long as possible in their own homes, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and provide assistance with everyday activities for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings for functional health assessment and intervention. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline,10267717,R01AG065218,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Family Planning', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'health assessment', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,603938
"Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Candace Feldman is an Instructor in Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy and the Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). Dr. Feldman has a longstanding passion to understand and reduce disparities in rheumatic diseases. Her research focuses on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in prevalence, access and outcomes among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her 14 peer-reviewed original publications, 8 first author, and 2 early career development grants exemplify her track record and her commitment to this field. She holds a MPH degree and is pursuing a doctorate in social epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her immediate goals are to learn and apply advanced health services research and qualitative methods to understand SLE-related avoidable acute care use to inform a future intervention. She will be guided by Dr. Costenbader, an established SLE epidemiologist, and an expert mentoring team. Dr. Feldman strives to apply rigorous methods to redesign healthcare delivery for vulnerable rheumatology patients. Environment: Dr. Feldman’s Division Chief ensures that >75% of her time will be protected for research and career development for the 5-year duration of this K23 award. She has financial support to supplement her salary and project-related expenses from the Division, the SCS, and her primary mentor’s funding. The BWH Lupus Center, co-directed by Dr. Costenbader, is the largest in New England. The research infrastructure established as part of the Center will enable Dr. Feldman to recruit patients. In addition, the SCS has extensive research infrastructure, which will continue to support her work. Dr. Feldman has access to Medicaid data under Dr. Costenbader’s Data Use Agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and to Partners HealthCare electronic health records linked to claims data through the explicit support of Population Health Management. For her training, she will have access to courses and mentorship at HSPH, where she is a doctoral student, and through Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Catalyst Program. Research: Dr. Feldman will rigorously define SLE-related conditions that may result in avoidable acute care use (e.g. emergency department visits and hospitalizations). She will then examine rates and predictors of potentially avoidable use, and associated mortality and costs in two large, diverse datasets. She will learn and apply qualitative methods, including Photovoice, which will empower SLE patients to photograph their homes and communities, to explore the contribution of social determinants to avoidable care use. Dr. Feldman will hold focus groups of SLE patients, providers and administrators to design a rheumatology-based intervention to improve healthcare delivery for these high-utilizing, vulnerable SLE patients. Dr. Feldman will develop skills in rigorous mixed methods research. This project, and the training Dr. Feldman will gain, will position her for a R01 and for a career as an independent social epidemiology and patient-oriented investigator in rheumatology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lupus is a complex autoimmune disease, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and resulting in high acute care use, much of which could be prevented if patients had consistent access to high-quality outpatient care. There is a need to define and understand lupus-specific avoidable acute care use (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) and to identify those patients at highest risk.

"AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers ABSTRACT In response to NOT-AG-20-034, the proposed Alzheimer’s-focused supplement will develop Connecting Audio And Radio Sensing Systems To Improve Care At Home for persons with early Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD) and their caregivers. The research proposed in this supplement aligns with the parent R01 study (R01LM013329). Persons with ADRD and their caregivers routinely confront various complex challenges and experience huge care burden. A common practice in technology-assisted care intervention is to guide patients and family caregivers through web and mobile phone-based training, health-vital monitoring, symptom reporting, and providing feedback and advice. These intervention programs, while have been shown to be effective, have three major demerits. First, a member of the care team (the patient or a family member) has to actively measure and enter patient data into the system, which is error-prone, subjective, and sometimes, forgotten. Second, web or mobile-based interactions can be cumbersome and demanding. Simple tasks like entering data, assessing health status, or getting and responding to an alert require typing and clicking through a series of electronic forms. Third, interactions between the system and the caregiver, especially when the system needs to remind or confirm an intervention, simple notifications and messages on a smartphone/website is often ineffective and unnoticed. To improve technology-based care interventions and to better serve persons with ADRD and their caregivers, the proposed study will adopt a user-centered approach to adapt and extend the AURA system that we have been developing in our ongoing R01. The research aims are: 1) Increase the robustness of the AURA subsystems; 2) Engage stakeholders (persons with early ADRD, caregivers, clinicians) to identify the needs of ADRD care and caregiving to help co-produce AURA-ALZ for persons with early ADRD and their caregivers; 3) Determine the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of AURA-ALZ in 10 persons with early ADRD and caregiver dyads' homes using mixed methods. Our current R01 aims to develop a technology- assisted AURA system for patients who are post-surgical treatment for bladder cancer and their caregivers. AURA passively monitors specific activities of a patient at home using WiFi signals, tailors natural language responses of voice assistants based on the patient's state, and automates entering data into the system to reduce the burden on the caregivers of cancer. AURA communicates with the care team in natural languages for reminders and confirmation of collected information, which is intuitive, handsfree, and less demanding. Building upon AURA, AURA-ALZ will have similar but enhanced features to address the unique care needs of persons with ADRD and caregivers. This study addresses the NLM’s mission of enabling biomedical research, supporting health care and public health, and promoting healthy behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the proposed study, we plan to adopt a user-centered approach to develop AURA-ALZ, an extended and adapted version of our innovative eHealth AURA program, to meet the needs of persons with ADRD and their caregivers. Different from previous interventions that focus on counseling, support groups, education, and skills training, AURA-ALZ will provide continuous monitoring of daily activities and gestures using a novel WiFi-based sensing technique, and enable voice-based user interactions, automated reminders, and hands-free surveys for guiding future individualized interventions for persons with early ADRD, which will help reduce caregiver burden, and ultimately, improve the health outcomes of the patients and caregivers.",AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers,10289180,R01LM013329,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Auras', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Patient', 'Car Phone', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Dependence', 'Devices', 'Economic Burden', 'Education', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Notification', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radio', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'care burden', 'caregiving', 'cognitive ability', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'dementia caregiving', 'eHealth', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional loss', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'learning classifier', 'member', 'multi-component intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'radio frequency', 'remote health care', 'research study', 'response', 'skills training', 'usability', 'web site']",NLM,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,75537
"The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities Very little is known about the impact of locally-mandated COVID-19 mitigation policies such as Non- Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) on the health and wellbeing of medically and economically vulnerable populations such as American Indians (AI) living in rural tribal lands. There is an urgent need to evaluate the effect of already implemented measures on the spread of COVID-19, the social and economic impact of those measures in these communities, and the potential spillover effects on non-AIAN communities. The staggered nature of the NPI implementation in tribal lands and the independence of sovereign nations’ policy decisions from local (e.g. county-level) policies present a unique quasi-natural experiment in policy timing, allowing us to study spillover effects from tribal NPIs to connected non-tribal areas. Our research efforts seek to improve American Indian health by understanding and evaluating these NPI measures on an NIH-designated disparity community. This R01 proposal has four specific aims: (1) Identify whether COVID-19 cases and deaths are related to the early closure of American Indian reservations and/or tribal casinos among Native and non-Native populations living on and off of adjacent reservation lands. (2) Identify the change in commuter patterns and movement behaviors as a result of NPIs. (3) Use in-time claims data to analyze how the implementation of NPIs and the progression of the epidemic affected utilization of different non-COVID-19 health care services and facilities. (4) Conduct a survey of American Indians living in rural areas to create a new primary data resource and cross-validate the results we obtain through analysis of secondary data of cell phone traffic flows. The long- term goal of this proposal is to develop and validate analytical tools that could be applied with large secondary datasets to aid the evaluation and design of public policies to address public health emergencies in AI populations. Our central hypothesis is that the timely implementation of tribal NPIs reduced the incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in AI communities and in traffic-connected areas. However, we also expect that the secondary effects of NPIs, such as economic hardship and under-utilization of non-COVID-related health care, would be stronger on tribal lands. We will use an innovative two-pronged approach to combine empirical analysis of secondary big data sources with primary data collection to provide robust evidence on the current and future effects of these policies. This proposal is significant because the impact of COVID-19 and related policies on tribal communities is under-researched, under-funded, and not well understood, and yet relevant not only for AI tribal policies and populations but for regional health and economic policies. Our research is guided by the C.A.R.E. Principles of Indigenous Data Governance developed by our team members. It is innovative because it applies techniques from economics, computer science and public health to deliver actionable results and recommendations for future policy implementation. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative The COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation strategies have been shown to disparately impact socially vulnerable and under-served minority groups in the US.

"Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models PROJECT SUMMARY  Racial-ethnic minorities (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals experience high levels of psychological distress. Psychological treatments can be effective in addressing mental health concerns, but disparities in quality of care still exist. Although systemic and institutional factors contribute to disparities in care, mental health providers are also critical to examine. A primary focus of efforts to understand and reduce provider contributions to mental health care disparities has been to examine cultural competency (CC), which involves a provider’s ability to navigate the cultural aspects of clinical interactions. Patient ratings of CC are generally associated with treatment outcomes and therapeutic processes. While patient perceptions of provider CC are important, a reliance on retrospective patient ratings limits what we know about how cultural identities are discussed, and the language that constitutes culturally sensitive care. Many studies of provider CC also require observers or patients to make complex judgments based on internal provider characteristics that are not reliably observable (e.g. rate provider awareness of their own cultural values). More studies are needed that examine patient-provider interactions in treatment in order to assess the impact of specific provider behaviors, and how they relate to perceptions of provider CC. Recently, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have been applied to psychotherapy conversations to automatically capture the use of evidence based treatments, topics of conversation, empathy, and emotional expression. Prior research demonstrating the feasibility of automatically identifying topics of conversation in psychotherapy suggest that NLP models could be trained to automatically identify specific moments in sessions where patients and providers are talking about cultural issues. NLP models could allow researchers to not only examine how specific patterns of provider-patient interactions drive CC, but might also provide rapid feedback to providers, and in turn help address disparities in care. The purpose of the current study is to do the foundational work to develop and evaluate NLP tools that capture the cultural content of provider-patient interactions among REM and LGBTQ patients. First, utilizing 32,436 labeled talk turns from 200 psychotherapy sessions we will evaluate the accuracy of NLP models in recognizing the discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy. Second, we will use NLP models to explore differences in the content of 1,235 psychotherapy sessions that were rated as highly positive or negative on a measure of cultural competence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although disparities in the quality of mental health treatment for racial-ethnic minority (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) patients are well known, to date there are no tools that can identify specific patterns of provider-patient interactions that drive disparities in care. This project will evaluate the ability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to recognize discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy among REM and LGBTQ patients, and explore differences in patient-provider interactions with low and high patient ratings of provider cultural competency.",Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models,10126722,F31MD014941,"['Address', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Discrimination', 'Empathy', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of Care', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Suicide', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'commercial application', 'community setting', 'cultural competence', 'cultural values', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care disparity', 'improved', 'provider behavior', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'racial and ethnic', 'sexual identity', 'showing emotion', 'substance abuse treatment', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'university student', 'willingness']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F31,2021,46036
"Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11% of older adults in the United States. Studies on patient transitions across healthcare settings suggests that older adults with chronic conditions are vulnerable to inadequate transfer of information, putting them at risk for diminished quality of care, medication errors and potentially preventable complications. Patients at varied stages along the ADRD trajectory – especially those with multiple chronic conditions – may experience unique risks due to the loss of information across care settings. In a recent study, we developed a longitudinal dataset on a diverse cohort of 56,652 patients – mostly aged 65+ with multiple comorbidities – receiving home health care (HHC) services from a large non-profit home care provider. For patients admitted to HHC in 2010-2012, we identified subgroups of patients with ADRD diagnoses made prior to and after HHC admission. Outside the scope of this prior study remains a vast and largely unexplored data source – nurses’ free-text clinical notes captured in the electronic health record. With roughly 1 million entries of nurses’ free- text notes associated with the study population, there is a wealth of potential information from which to gain new insights and a need for innovative methods to analyze this unstructured data source. In this study, we propose to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a method for systematically analyzing free-text content that draws upon machine learning. Using the dataset developed in the prior study, this study aims to: 1. Expand and improve an existing NLP system to automatically identify the following information in the  nursing free-text notes: (i) knowledge of the patient having a previously established ADRD diagnosis; (ii)  observations of cognitive symptoms and related patient/caregiver needs; and (iii) mentions of interventions  to address these needs. 2. For patients who do not have an ADRD diagnosis prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-  text documentation of cognitive symptoms identified in the NLP predict subsequent ADRD diagnoses  during the 4-year follow-up period. 3. Among patients diagnosed with ADRD prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-text  documentation patterns (e.g. knowledge of the patient’s ADRD diagnostic status, observations of cognitive  symptoms, and interventions) predict: (i) service use; and (ii) adverse health outcomes for which ADRD  patients are at heightened risk (e.g. hospitalizations due to urinary tract infection, dehydration, falls). This study will allow us to examine HHC nurses’ practices, which are often difficult to observe systematically, and identify strategies to address the complex needs of their patients with ADRD and un-diagnosed patients who may be on a path toward ADRD diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a home- based intervention that aims to improve quality of life for patients and caregivers along the ADRD trajectory. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5 million people in the U.S. Home health care nurses provide care for many people with ADRD and document what they observe about their patients’ needs in the form of free-text notes. This study will use a method known as ‘natural language processing’ to gain new knowledge from nurses’ notes and identify ways to better support people with ADRD and their caregivers.","Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study",10219952,R21AG065753,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Assessment tool', 'Awareness', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Nursing', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dehydration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home Care Services', 'Home Health Care Agencies', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicare claim', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'New York', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Services', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Visiting Nurse', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'health care settings', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'patient home care', 'patient subsets', 'racial and ethnic', 'study population', 'unstructured data']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R21,2021,213501
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,10198898,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2021,130317
"ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, 5.7 million people live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) in the United States, and this number is projected to reach 13.8 million by 2050. Two-thirds of individuals with ADRD live at home and as a result, approximately 15 million unpaid care partners, mostly family members, are increasingly required to perform complex tasks which causes them significant stress. The major contributors to care partners’ stress are: 1) having low confidence in their competency in their caregiving tasks, such as managing activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and behavioral symptoms of ADRD as they change over the course of the disease and 2) being socially isolated with feelings of loneliness. Benten proposes to address these problems through creation of the Avatar Companion to Improve the Lives of Informal care partners of individuals with Alzheimer’s (ACILIA), a home kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities (i.e., emotion analysis, sentiment analysis and life-long machine learning [L3] algorithm), with home speakers, a smart watch, and mobile app, to support the CPs on the care journey. ACILIA will provide just-in--time guidance and support to care partners in addition to stage- appropriate education and training on how to manage caregiving tasks. It will also engage in natural conversations with the care partners detecting sentiments of stress and offering advice and support and connection to a virtual community. ACILIA aims to assist in reducing the family care partners’ stress levels by improving their competency and capabilities in providing care and by providing companionship and support, which will reflect positively on their quality of life and that of their loved ones living with ADRD and aging in place. During this Phase I project, we will develop of a prototype ACILIA using input from an advisory board of informal care partners and people living with ADRD. We will also conduct a pilot test for feasibility of ACILIA among 20 individuals who are in early-middle stage ADRD and their informal care partners to evaluate the usability and acceptance of ACILIA prototype. Successful completion of Phase I will lead to Phase II and evaluating its outcomes. improving informal care partners’ competency, reducing their feeling of loneliness, and reducing their stress levels in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT). PROJECT NARRATIVE User-centered design and pilot testing conducted for the Phase 1 development of ACILIA will make it possible to evaluate the feasibility of ACILIA to support informal care partners of PLWAD in their care efforts. In the long-term, Benten envisions ACILIA becoming a valuable tool for informal care partners, enabling them to perform their caregiving tasks more effectively by delivering just-in-time stage-appropriate training and stress- reduction support, and offering companionship throughout the journey of providing dementia care.",ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support,10250533,R43AG069659,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anger', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Frustration', 'Home environment', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Role', 'Services', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'United States', 'Universities', 'aging in place', 'base', 'care burden', 'caregiving', 'coping', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'informal care', 'informal support', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'loved ones', 'member', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mobile application', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'online community', 'prototype', 'smart watch', 'social', 'stress reduction', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,"BENTEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2021,196867
"Development of a reminiscence therapy online platform with machine learning to increase engagement with people living with dementia and their care partners PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or AD-related dementias, and the number of affected individuals is rapidly growing. Symptoms include impaired cognition, resulting in difficulty in performing daily activities and consequent functional dependence on others. The progressive nature of AD and ADRD can result in increasing degrees of care required from professional and family caregivers. Non- pharmacologic interventions positively influence cognition, mood, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and one well-established intervention, life story work (the use of written and oral life histories), serves as an effective technique that can elicit conversation and memories in those with AD and ADRD. However, generating useful life story materials is a time-consuming task for caregivers. To overcome this barrier, LifeBio Inc. is developing a reminiscence therapy platform —LifeBio MemoryTM— with a novel machine-learning-based application that converts speech to text and generates life stories to serve as an interactive tool to cultivate communication between people living with dementia and their family and caregivers. The LifeBio MemoryTM platform application will elicit and store individuals’ stories, photos, and videos and ultimately deliver personalized, point-of-care reminiscence therapy exercises for patients. In preliminary work supporting this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Inc. partnered with the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging to conduct a pilot study in nursing homes, which showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms among participants in LifeBio Inc.’s intervention and revealed that the majority of participants considered knowledge of their life story to be important for caregivers, while caregivers also reported positive experiences in relation to the impact of the intervention on caregiving. In this project we will: 1) Develop prototype enhancements of the existing LifeBio program and conduct focus group evaluations of these prototypes with 12 existing or former LifeBio users, 20 dementia care professionals familiar with LifeBio and 6 older adults with early-stage dementia to help maintain person-centered practices throughout the research process; 2) Finalize the LifeBio Memory product, which will include the development of a system to automatically record and process individuals’ life stories. 3) Conduct a full-scale fidelity trial of the complete package with 40 care professionals and 160 dementia care dyads across within an assisted living setting. The product of this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Memory™, will be a novel, scalable, and easily implemented solution through which caregivers and healthcare providers can offer person-centered care to people living with AD and AD-related dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Non-pharmacological interventions and person-centered care strategies are important elements of care for people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.

"Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors PROJECT SUMMARY Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by persons with dementia (PWD), affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Agitation brings much stress and detriment to patients and caregivers. Treatment of agitation is often pharmacological intervention which can have adverse side effects. There is a great need for identification of early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation so that it can pave the way for proactive management of agitation and lower the burden on caregivers. The overall goal of this project is to address this critical unmet need through the proposed research and mentored training of the applicant. The Oregon Center for Aging & Technology (ORCATECH), under the direction of Dr. Kaye (proposed primary mentor), has more than a decade of experience developing and deploying a digital behavioral assessment platform in older adults' homes and has the experience analyzing the data collected in the clinical context of older adults. The scientific goals of this proposal are to develop digital behavioral markers that identify episodes of agitation, identify early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation, and build a risk prediction model of episodes of agitation using environmental and behavioral sensors and techniques from machine learning and time series analysis. The applicant will collect behavioral data from 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living in memory care units and 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living at their own homes using passive infrared motion sensors, wearable actigraphy devices, and bed pressure mats and follow them for 2 years. Such behavioral data will be used to identify digital behavioral markers that indicate or predict episodes of agitation. The applicant will also collect environmental data (ambient light level, noise level, temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure) from their living environments, and such data will be used to identify environmental precipitants of agitation. In order to conduct the proposed study and prepare for an independent research career, the applicant will be trained through taking courses and attending workshops in the following areas: (1) the different diagnosis and standard of care for PWD, their neuropsychiatric symptoms and their precipitants; (2) methods of using technology in dementia research; (3) novel methods from deep learning and time series analysis for building risk prediction models of agitation; and (4) development of professional skills for conducting successful and ethically responsible clinical research. The proposed team of mentors and consultant each provide expertise in one or more of these areas and are together committed to collaboratively facilitating the applicant's training. The applicant will apply these new skills to the proposed research project and obtain R01 support in order to use the methods for detecting and predicting episode of agitation to create and explore the effectiveness of early interventions for agitation in PWD. Such findings are likely to lead to improve methods for reducing and detecting episodes of agitation and ultimately help protect caregivers' physical and mental health while improving dementia care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms among persons with dementia, affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Pharmacological treatment of agitation often has adverse side effects, and time-constrained caregivers cannot reasonably be expected to monitor the patients and take continuous note of the environment to identify precipitants of agitation. The research and training for this Mentored Quantitative Research Development Award will be centered on identifying digital behavioral markers both during and preceding agitation, identifying environmental precipitants of agitation, and building risk prediction models of agitation using data collected from patients with later-stage dementia and their living environment.",Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors,10190522,K25AG071841,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Controlled Environment', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Family Caregiver', 'Formal caregiver', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Activity', 'Noise', 'Nursing Records', 'Oregon', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Residential Treatment', 'Resources', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'aging and technology', 'analytical method', 'barometric pressure', 'burnout', 'care providers', 'career', 'caregiver strain', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'informal care', 'informal caregiver', 'intervention cost', 'memory care', 'motion sensor', 'multimodality', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'poor sleep', 'pressure', 'research and development', 'research study', 'residence', 'risk prediction model', 'sensor', 'side effect', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'standard of care']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K25,2021,147437
"Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research Project Summary/Abstract Disparities in health and health care have been a longstanding challenge in the United States. One specific area of medical care in which racial/ethnic disparities have been identified is total joint arthroplasty (TJA), particularly total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). Large, population based studies necessary to address healthcare disparities can be costly and difficult to perform, and may be compromised by sampling strategies and patient selection biases. Efficient alternatives are publicly-available nationally representative databases such as the HCUP State Inpatient Databases (SID) and National Inpatient Sample (NIS). The SID provide information on all patients admitted to hospitals within participating states, allowing for comparison of health care access among many vulnerable populations, across states, and over time. The NIS is the largest publicly-available all-payer inpatient health care database in the nation. It is sampled from the SID through a complex survey design, yielding national estimates of health care utilization, quality, and outcomes. A significant limitation of the NIS and the SID is the quantity of missing data. In particular, “patient race”, a key indicator for health disparities research, has a high proportion of missingness. Multiple imputation (MI) approaches have been increasingly popular for providing sound statistical methods to account for missing data. When conducting MI, it is suggested that imputation models be as general as data allow them to be, in order to accommodate a wide range of subsequent analyses of imputed data sets. This requires all relationships that are going to be investigated in any subsequent analysis, such as nonlinearities and interactions, to be included in the imputation model. Unfortunately, traditional MI methods, such as the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), are built on parametric imputation models. These models are often not flexible enough to capture interactions and nonlinearities in high dimensional and large scale data settings. Unlike parametric models, machine learning techniques (MLTs) are model-free methods, and thus provide flexibility for missing data imputation. MLTs use algorithms that automatically and iteratively learn from all data to detect statistical dependencies in observations without being explicitly programmed where to look. The goal of this study is to make the two HCUP databases a more useful resource for the study of surgical disparities and other areas of medicine. Accordingly, we propose novel MI methods based on MLTs to impute missing data in the SID and the NIS, and to use the imputed datasets to measure racial disparity in TKA. Project Narrative It would be challenging to approach the goal of eliminating healthcare disparities without identifying disparities and analyzing the underlying causes using nationally representative databases such as the HCUP SID and NIS. This proposal imputes missing data for surgical disparities research using the two databases.",Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research,10199999,R01MD013901,"['Address', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Records', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'administrative database', 'autoencoder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'high dimensionality', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'large scale data', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial disparity', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'underserved community', 'usability']",NIMHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,241504
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,10166954,R01NR016732,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Nursing', 'Research', 'Self Management', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain health', 'care costs', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'design', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'personalized intervention', 'physical conditioning', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home', 'social', 'technology validation', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352640
"Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies). PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Every year Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051). Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low- cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS). The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare system with Epic nationwide. The high costs of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will consist of two complementary studies at diverse urban, suburban, and rural primary care practices within Central Indiana and South Florida. The first study Aim will evaluate the predictive performance of the Passive Digital Marker, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) using Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) data embedded within the Electronic Health Records, and the combined approach (Passive + QDRS) in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), compared to the gold standard of diagnoses. The second study Aim will evaluate the practical utility and effect of the Passive Digital Marker, the QDRS, and the combined methods in improving the annual rate of new documented ADRD diagnosis in primary care practices. The project will compare different approaches to early detection of ADRD, crucial to the endeavors to stop dementia progression; it will also evaluate the low-cost combined methods and integrated approach to overcome current barriers to ADRD detection.",Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies).,10266121,R01AG069765,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'American', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical dementia rating scale', 'Code', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'patient screening', 'response', 'rural area', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'suburb', 'tool', 'underserved area', 'validation studies']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,1048978
"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images African American and Latinx communities nationally and in California not only bear a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths but are also not taking part in COVID-19 testing for a wide range of understudied reasons. This can have profound implications in safety net health care settings where vulnerable patients, who are in need of clinical procedures to prevent significant morbidity, are refusing such potentially lifesaving procedures because of fear of COVID-19 testing and/or contracting COVID-19. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) is the second largest publicly operated county safety net health care system in the United States, serving more than 750,000 patients annually. Timely access to health care in this under-resourced, high-need setting has been an ongoing challenge for its majority Latinx and African American patients. With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why patients refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. To this end, we propose to explore the obstacles to COVID-19 pre- procedural testing and provide COVID-19 specific training to LACDHS Community Health Workers (CHWs) from these same communities to effectively address: a) the primary goal of increasing COVID-19 testing for individual patients, and the secondary goals of b) facilitating needed procedural care in a timely manner for the safety net health system, and c) developing a sustained public health presence in these communities to build trust and preparedness for critical COVID-19 related future needs. Trained CHWs can help to more effectively overcome obstacles to COVID-19 testing, including historical barriers of mistrust, provide COVID-19 health education, help address social determinants of health and help facilitate technological literacy to improve patient access to testing and care in a telehealth environment. The proposal uses a multidisciplinary, mixed- methods approach including unsupervised machine learning and qualitative interviews to systematically explore barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing among vulnerable safety net patients. We will then train clinically based, ethnically/linguistically matched CHWs to implement a hypothesis-driven intervention consisting of six group classes and six personalized patient encounters with African American and Latinx safety net patients. This study has the following specific aims: Aim 1- Utilize machine learning methods to assess whether there are characteristics that define African American and Latinx safety-net patients who engage in or refuse COVID-19 testing; Aim 2 - Conduct in-depth interviews with African American and Latinx patients who either declined or accepted COVID testing to explore contextual, behavioral, and attitudinal factors shaping patient circumstances and concerns; Aim 3 - Develop, implement, and pre-test a CHW intervention with the information from Aims 1 and 2, utilizing a randomized control design among African American and Latinx safety net patients to assess the effect of the CHW hypothesis-driven intervention on trust, self-efficacy, and intent to participate in COVID-19 testing. Project Narrative With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why vulnerable patients in safety net health care settings refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. This grant is an innovative proposal that seeks to (1) bring together machine learning and behavioral methods to understand the reasons why Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) safety net patients who require COVID-19 testing for procedures refuse or accept COVID-19 testing, and (2) utilize the knowledge gleaned to implement a Community Health Worker (CHW)-based intervention, using LACDHS CHWs, that addresses the multilevel obstacles to COVID- 19 testing. Insights gained from this research may be of benefit to improve COVID-19 uptake in other similar safety net settings with CHWs and in planning the future uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in such medically underserved settings.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,10258973,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Behavioral', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 testing', 'COVID-19 vaccine', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Health Services', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health education', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Housing', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'PhenX Toolkit', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Religion', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transportation', 'Trust', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccines', 'Weighing patient', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'economic need', 'health care availability', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'literacy', 'machine learning method', 'medically underserved', 'multidisciplinary', 'outreach', 'pandemic disease', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'retinal imaging', 'safety net', 'skills', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'telehealth', 'testing access', 'testing uptake', 'unsupervised learning', 'uptake', 'vaccine acceptance', 'virtual intervention', 'virtual patient']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology PROJECT SUMMARY Healthcare has changed rapidly in the last decade with the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) and the creation of national EHR-based data networks that aim to improve the quality of care. The American College of Rheumatology's RISE registry is a federally Qualified Clinical Data Registry that collects EHR data from the practices of almost 1000 rheumatologists nationally, analyzes these data centrally, and continuously feeds back performance on quality measures to practices via a web-based dashboard. In this K24 proposal, the applicant proposes to utilize novel methods in clinical informatics to increase the accuracy of quality measurement, while also developing and testing new EHR-based quality measures relevant to rheumatic diseases. The proposed research will leverage her strong research portfolio, including grants from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, her successful track record of achieving national endorsement for EHR-based quality measures, existing data from over 1.4 million patients in the RISE database, and the outstanding institutional environment at the University of California, San Francisco. It will also support her ongoing career development in clinical informatics methods relevant to EHR-based clinical research. For this five year K24 award proposal, she plans to increase the time spent mentoring junior investigators in the field or quality and outcomes measurement in rheumatology, with the goal of helping trainees successfully launch academic research careers in patient- oriented research. Aligned with a comprehensive mentoring plan, the proposal outlines two specific aims, including using natural language processing to increase the accuracy of EHR-based quality measurement in RISE, and developing and validating new, prototype electronic clinical quality measures to monitor and address high impact gaps in care for patients with rheumatic disease. The work will prioritize outcome measures and use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model and Health Quality Measures Format to develop, specify and test measures. Measures developed through this research and mentoring program will be candidates for nationwide dissemination across rheumatology practices to improve care for individuals with rheumatic disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This mid-career investigator award will support a program in patient-oriented research in rheumatic diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. The award will allow the applicant to expand her research on the development and validation of health care quality measures and support her mentoring of early investigators.

"When dementia caregiving ends: The role of patient-caregiver social connection in caregivers' health and well-being PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases lead to profound cognitive, emotional, and functional impairments. As these diseases progress, the person with dementia (PWD) becomes increasingly dependent on a caregiver for functional, psychological, and economic assistance. It is well-documented that caring for a PWD is associated with considerable declines in health and well-being. Evidence suggests that many caregivers continue to experience these adverse effects for years after caregiving has ended (after the death of the PWD), though this area has received less attention. There is also striking variability in the extent to which caregivers experience these consequences – both during caregiving and after it has ended. Research on the sources of these individual differences has largely focused on factors related to the external environment, the PWD, or the caregiver that contribute to increased vulnerability in caregivers. Although research has linked PWD-caregiver relationship quality with declines in caregiver well-being, little is known about the specific interpersonal mechanisms that contribute to caregiver outcomes. For example, the positive emotional qualities of the PWD-caregiver social connection may buffer against the negative effects of caregiving stress, whereas lower quality social connection may drive increases in caregivers’ loneliness. In the proposed research, I will measure PWD-caregiver social connection through observational measures derived from basic affective science, including dyadic coding of emotional behavior in a laboratory-based interaction between PWDs and caregivers (Study 1; N = 186) and text analysis of emotional language caregivers used when describing a recent time they felt connected to the PWD (Study 2; N = 533). I will then determine the impact of PWD-caregiver social connection on caregivers’ health and well-being (Aim 1), both concurrently (in current caregivers) and longitudinally (in former caregivers, after caregiving has ended). Additionally, I will compare the relative strength of these associations between current and former caregivers, and I will investigate possible mechanisms (e.g., loneliness) through which PWD-caregiver social connection is linked to caregivers’ health and well-being. I will then evaluate the predictive value of PWD-caregiver social connection on caregivers’ health and well-being, above and beyond an optimal set of predictors identified through machine learning (Aim 2). The proposed dissertation research will prepare me to conduct future studies investigating the socioemotional mechanisms that may influence caregivers’ health trajectories. This F31 will provide the necessary support to accomplish the following research goals: (1) to further expertise in basic affective science methodologies (e.g., dyadic behavioral coding, text analysis); (2) to achieve advanced proficiency in statistical techniques for longitudinal and machine learning analyses; and (3) to enhance knowledge of neurodegenerative disease, including neuropsychology and differential diagnosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Dementia and other neurodegenerative disease are progressive, debilitating illnesses that require assistance from loved ones serving as caregivers. Caring for a person with dementia is associated with significantly heightened risk for adverse consequences, such as reduced health and well-being, which may persist for years after caregiving has ended. Identifying mechanisms that convey risk for the long-term adverse effects of caregiving can facilitate developing more effective interventions with major public health benefits.",When dementia caregiving ends: The role of patient-caregiver social connection in caregivers' health and well-being,10235400,F31AG072891,"['Accounting', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affective', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Buffers', 'California', 'Caregiver well-being', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Ecosystem', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care giving burden', 'caregiving', 'dementia caregiving', 'effective intervention', 'emotional behavior', 'emotional functioning', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'loved ones', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'social', 'social relationships']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2021,46036
