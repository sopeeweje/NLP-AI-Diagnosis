"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,10076848,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preservation', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,395000
"A multifaceted adaptive mobile application to promote self-management and improve outcomes in heart failure PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Strikingly, 2 in 5 patients are readmitted within 1-year following their first HF admission. This results in significant potentially avoidable costs to our already strained healthcare system, since hospitalizations result in 70% of yearly HF management costs. The most common causes of readmission are failure to recognize clinical worsening and dietary nonadherence. As a result, HF management is rapidly evolving from the traditional model of face-to-face follow-up visits toward a proactive real-time technological model of assisting patients with monitoring and self-management while in the community. While several HF studies have implemented technologically-driven disease management programs, results have been mixed. These systems effectively deliver monitoring data and alerts to healthcare providers. However, their effectiveness in delivering behavioral interventions to patients and modifying patient behavior, a crucial factor in HF self-management, is unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and test patient- centered technologies that deliver behavioral interventions to promote self-management for the most common causes of readmissions with an overall goal of reducing HF readmissions. This proposed project will determine the effectiveness of two interventions within a mobile application and builds on our work from previous research. Our central hypothesis is that a patient-centered mobile application with contextual just-in-time interventions about self-management during a clinical worsening and dietary sodium will improve the health status of HF patients. The rationale for this project, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that a new model for disease management - placing patients in control of their condition - will have a substantial positive impact on HF outcomes. Our objectives are to: (1) determine the impact of two unique adaptive mobile application interventions on HF readmission and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HF patients, (2) establish the effect the interventions have on proximal outcomes and that the proximal outcomes mediate the intervention’s impact on HF readmission and HRQOL, and (3) develop data-driven machine learning models that can predict episodes of clinical worsening.

"Inconspicuous Daily Monitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Hospitalizations Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This is especially important for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), a type of CVD characterized by a weakened heart muscle, impacts approximately 6.5 million Americans with over 960,000 new cases each year. HF costs the US an estimated $30.7 billion annually and is expected to increase 127% to $69.7 billion by 2030. With approximately 80% of the total cost associated with HF due to hospitalization, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost of HF by lowering hospitalization rates through remote patient monitoring. Since patient awareness of symptomology often lags deterioration, successfully tracking physiologic changes in the home is a critical component of an early intervention strategy. Classical approaches to in-home monitoring, such as blood pressure and weight monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as major barrier to reducing hospitalizations. The central hypothesis of this research is that hospitalization rates and duration of stay for heart failure patients can be significantly reduced through inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention. This research will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT). The FIT seat automatically captures a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment in the home, while ensuring long-term patient adherence. A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers, physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient deterioration using the FIT system measurements captured in the home. The success of this system will be evaluated through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients. Specific Aim 1 seeks to create a learning dataset and data visualization architecture from HF patient in-home physiologic data, perceived wellness, and adverse events. The FIT seat will be deployed for a 90-day in-home study of 200 HF patients, with patient perceived wellness and activity captured through a custom application. This physiologic, wellness, and activity data will be combined with adverse events from the electronic medical record to create an integrated dataset for retrospective analysis and alert model development. In Aim 2, an automated prediction model for early alert of all-cause hospitalizations will be created using novel machine learning techniques. The objective of Aim 3 is to demonstrate that inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention can reduce hospitalizations in a second cohort of 200 HF patients. We hypothesize that the integrated FIT-based alert system will reduce the burden of all-cause hospitalization and will improve the quality of life for patients.

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross Cohort Collaboration ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF), and its subtypes defined by preserved (HFpEF), reduced (HFrEF) or mid-range (HFmrEF) ejection fraction are a major and growing public health problem. The long term goal of this project is to better understand the health disparities regarding HF and define effective preventive measures that may reduce these disparities. We propose to pool data from 10 large longitudinal cohort studies to examine race/ethnic and sex disparities in developing HF, its subtypes, and its prognosis. The harmonized data will include over 130,028 men and women with over 8975 similarly-adjudicated prospective HF outcomes, representing a wide spectrum of ages, race/ethnicities, and geographic regions of the United States. This cross-cohort collaboration will provide a unique opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of sex and racial/ethnic health disparities in HF. Causal mediation analysis techniques will be used to estimate the degree to which single and multi-factor lifestyle and clinical interventions could potentially reduce health disparities in HF. In our phenomapping aim, we will define unique clinically relevant phenotypes of HF based upon cohort data that is also commonly present in medical records for enhanced generalizability, including age, race/ethnicity, sex, clinical signs, symptoms, biomarkers, ejection fraction, physiologic measures, and co-morbidities; we will also evaluate HF phenotype associations with CVD and all-cause mortality. NARRATIVE This Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross-Cohort Collaboration study will evaluate the magnitude and potential causes of racial/ethnic and sex disparities in incident heart failure and its subtypes and their prognosis in over 130,000 men and women from 10 pooled cohorts. We will evaluate the impact of hypothetical lifestyle and clinical risk factors interventions on reducing the racial/ethnic disparities in developing HF.

"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system. Our proposal will identify the factors contributing to these population differences in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage.",Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients,10114147,R01HL141892,"['Affect', 'Albumins', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Event', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanics', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Liver Failure', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Prostitution', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Restrictive Cardiomyopathy', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Failure', 'United Network for Organ Sharing', 'Update', 'Vibrissae', 'Waiting Lists', 'Woman', 'base', 'cardiac cachexia', 'cardiac device', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'forest', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'post-transplant', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant database', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2021,526607
"Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI Project Summary / Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is accounts for 1 in 9 deaths in the United States and currently affects ~6 million with a prevalence of 250,00-400,000 and incidence of 70,000-120,000. Current therapy does not address the underlying loss of functional heart muscle and adverse structural remodeling. One novel potential treatment of HF is exercise (aerobic) therapy that has demonstrated various cardioprotective properties to halt and potentially reverse adverse structural remodeling. However, dosing of exercise therapy remains a challenge due to each individual's inherent differences and consequentially, serial non-invasive monitoring of the therapy would be necessary to evaluate the change on structural remodeling. Furthermore, current non-invasive technologies characterize structural remodeling with surrogate measures and thus, there is no consensus on a single clinical gold-standard. Without a tool to monitor and characterize the degree of structural remodeling, the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of exercise therapy in HF patients cannot be fully realized representing an unmet need in ultimately improving therapy. The proposed project aims to improve the therapy monitoring of exercise training to cardioprotect against HF by revealing its effect on microstructural remodeling with cardiac diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI). DT-MRI is a unique, non-invasive technology capable of characterizing myocardial fiber orientation and directly reflecting microstructural remodeling. However, despite major advances, there are fundamental challenges that limit the capability of current cardiac DT-MRI methods to be applied robustly in a clinical setting. In this project, an innovative 5-min “push button” DT-MRI method will be developed that overcomes such limitations. We also leverage institutional strengths to further quantify the accuracy of in vivo DT-MRI in revealing myocardial microstructure using novel tissue cleared 3D histology. The central hypothesis is that addressing these major technical challenges will allow for clinical translation of cardiac DT-MRI to serve as a tool to monitor the therapeutic effects of HF on microstructural remodeling. This is achieved by extending previously developed technologies used for myocardial fibrosis detection with diffusion-weighted MRI. The proposed project is designed to systematically develop an innovative and robust clinical DT-MRI methodology and rigorously validate in a pre-clinical setting the effects of exercise therapy on the microstructural remodeling of HF thereby laying the groundwork for potential optimization of dosing exercise therapy. Project Narrative This project ultimately aims at optimizing the non-invasive monitoring of exercise therapy in heart failure patients to potentially improve outcome. The research strategy is designed to systematically develop an innovative cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that overcomes major shortcomings of the conventional methods and aims at immediate clinical translation. Successful completion of this project will result in a clinically robust cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that can effectively monitor the efficacy of exercise therapy and potentially improve treatment of heart failure.",Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI,10214689,R01HL151704,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Exhibits', 'Family suidae', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Histology', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Pacemakers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'RNA marker', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Pathway', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Tachycardia', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'cardioprotection', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'coronary fibrosis', 'denoising deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exercise training', 'functional loss', 'heart function', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'preservation', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'reconstruction', 'sedentary', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,673600
"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,10136697,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'blood pressure variability', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,172800
"Deep Learning Assessment of the Right Ventricle: Function, Etiology, and Prognosis ABSTRACT Heart failure imposes a tremendous burden of morbidity and mortality, costing the United States in excess of $31 billion annually. An increasingly recognized major determinant of outcomes in heart failure is right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. However, the nature and character of RV contribution to cardiovascular outcomes remains poorly understood, largely due to the imprecision of imaging and interpretation of RV morphology and function. Echocardiography, with its high temporal resolution and low cost of acquisition, serves as frontline cardiovascular imaging and a mainstay in approaches to assessing RV morphology and function. However, echocardiographic imaging of the RV is limited by factors that include technical variation in image acquisition and heterogeneity in image assessment as well as overall interpretation. We postulate that deep learning based phenotyping can offer the ability to not only more precisely characterize RV function but also classify RV imaging phenotypes according to etiologic disease states and, even further, refine prognostic evaluations of future cardiovascular risk. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use video-based deep learning segmentation models to assess RV function, evaluate its cross-sectional relation with a range of expert-measured parameters, and examine its variation in the context of patient characteristics derived from large hospital-based cohorts. In Aim 2, we will use video-based deep learning models to produce imaging-based classification of RV disease and assess the ability of unsupervised approaches to classify RV dysfunction into various categories of disease etiology. In Aim 3, we will use models developed in part from training in Aims 1 and 2 to predict major cardiovascular outcomes including heart failure in addition to coronary artery disease, stroke, and cardiovascular death in both hospital- based and community-based cohorts. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve the precision and standardization of RV phenotyping and determine the extent to which deep learning models can augment human assessment of the RV. This research will be accomplished in the setting of a comprehensive career development program designed to provide the candidate with the skills needed to become an independent physician-scientist in cardiovascular medicine and translational imaging science.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Heart failure imposes a tremendous morbidity and mortality burden, costing the U.S. healthcare system over $31 billion per year. An under-recognized and yet important contributor to heart failure outcomes is right ventricular dysfunction, which remains understudied due to technical issues that have historically challenged conventional approaches to cardiovascular imaging. We will examine how deep learning models can precisely evaluate right ventricular function – and enable earlier, more accurate assessments of its contributions to cardiovascular risk.","Deep Learning Assessment of the Right Ventricle: Function, Etiology, and Prognosis",10185865,K99HL157421,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia', 'Award', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dissection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Program Development', 'Prospective cohort', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Right Ventricular Dysfunction', 'Right Ventricular Function', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'hands on research', 'healthcare community', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'study population', 'success', 'temporal measurement']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2021,154780
"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Clinicians need tools to identify adults with physical frailty as part of routine care to support early intervention to treat frailty and reduce this risk. This application seeks to develop a novel measure of physical frailty using data collected as part of routine clinical care and recorded in the electronic health record.",Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure,10199037,K25HL152006,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'American', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'frailty', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'random forest', 'routine care', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K25,2021,143762
"Cardiac MR-Based Risk Stratification for Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in HCM Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease, affecting as many as 1:200 individuals in the general population. HCM, initially described in the context of sudden cardiac death (SCD), is commonly associated with heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Rigorous research over the past two decades has enabled us to identify HCM patients at the greatest risk of SCD who could benefit from a prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). With advances in SCD prevention, HCM management has now shifted its focus to HF and AF. Nearly 50% of HCM patients have mild to severe HF symptoms. HF is now considered the most common cause of HCM-related mortality. AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia, occurring in nearly 25% of HCM patients, and responsible for a decreased quality of life and increased stroke risk. Currently, we are not able to predict which HCM patients are more likely to progress toward end-stage HF or develop AF. Cardiovascular imaging using echocardiography and cardiac MR has played a central role in our evolving understanding of HCM. Echocardiography provides a robust assessment of left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction and diastolic dysfunction. With its high spatial resolution and remarkable tissue characterization capabilities, cardiac MR has emerged as an imaging modality well suited to characterize the HCM phenotype. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel risk stratification paradigms by leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve HCM patient management. We will investigate a deep learning (DL) risk model for prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes that incorporates (a) standard clinical and imaging parameters and (b) novel cardiac MR signatures extracted using (i) radiomic analysis (i.e. a computational method to automatically extract and select clinically significant imaging markers) or (ii) deep imaging signatures, extracted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The performance of these models will be rigorously evaluated using 3 HCM cohorts collected at Tufts Medical Center, BIDMC, and University of Toronto.

"Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope Abstract This SBIR Phase II project will develop a deep learning-based clinical decision support algorithm for detecting and diagnosing valvular heart disease based on heart sounds recorded using the Eko Core and Eko Duo Digital Stethoscopes. This screening tool will help to decrease the number of patients with valvular heart disease that remain undertreated simply because their condition is not diagnosed. Auscultation is commonly the method by which valvular heart disease is first detected, but cases often fail to be referred to echocardiography for diagnosis because clinicians fail to detect heart murmurs, particularly in noisy or rushed environments. To address this challenge, Eko had developed the Core, a digital stethoscope attachment that can be added in-line to a clinician’s existing stethoscope that amplifies heart sounds and Duo, a digital stethoscope in a handheld form factor with built-in single lead electrocardiogram. Both devices are designed to stream digitized phonocardiograms to a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. There, the signal can be analyzed with the decision support algorithm we will develop as part of this project. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to collect a database with condition- specific recording labels to enable deep learning for heart sounds though clinical data collection at six clinical sites, and (2) to develop and evaluate a collection of deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms trained on the database. These algorithms will (2a) distinguish between systolic, diastolic and continuous murmurs, (2b) classify aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and innocent murmurs (2c) assess the severity of AS, MR and TR. By integrating these deep learning algorithms into Eko's mobile and cloud software platform, currently used by clinicians at over 1000 institutions worldwide, we anticipate this algorithm will enable more accurate screening for valvular heart disease in adult patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes. Public Health Relevance Valvular heart disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent manifestation of poor cardiovascular health in both the developed and developing world. A highly-accurate clinical decision support algorithm that is able to detect and classify valvular heart disease will impact public health by reducing unnecessary referrals for echocardiography and promoting early and accurate diagnosis in underserved areas with limited access to specialty care.",Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope,10215611,R44HL144297,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Auscultation', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Eko', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart murmur', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm training', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cloud software', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sound', 'underserved area']",NHLBI,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R44,2021,920184
"Evaluating and Improving Utilization of Evidence-Based Medical Therapy in Patients with Heart Failure using Automated Tools in the Electronic Health Record PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) affects over 6 million US adults, with high rates of hospitalization and nearly 50% mortality at 5 years from diagnosis. Nearly half of these patients have systolic HF with multiple evidence-based therapeutic options proven to reduce the risk of hospitalization and mortality in this subgroup of patients. Evaluating the appropriate utilization of these therapies is currently limited to post-hoc assessments of manually abstracted patient records at a limited number of hospitals participating in quality improvement registries. These manual abstraction strategies do not offer opportunities to improve care in real-time, and even at hospitals engaged in quality improvement efforts, only 1 in 5 of eligible patients with HF receive all first-line evidence based medical treatments. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Rohan Khera proposes to leverage the ubiquitous digitization of medical records in the electronic health record (EHR) to address the adequate utilization of evidence based medical therapy in HF. He proposes to use a large, publicly accessible, deidentified EHR database to develop and validate an algorithm that uses deep learning based natural language processing (NLP) within unstructured clinical documentation for hospitalized HF patients to identify those with systolic HF (Aim #1). He will engage clinicians to design consensus-based algorithms to identify contraindications to HF treatments, developed as algorithms within the EHR (Aim #2). Finally, he will construct a prototypic clinical decision support (CDS) tool identifying HF treatment eligibility in real-time using the algorithms and evaluate potential implementation strategies using qualitative evaluation of feedback from clinicians and patients (Aim #3). While proposed as a strategy to evaluate quality of care of individual patients, the proposed research will also model a fully automated electronic clinical quality measure for HF. The algorithms will be made open source to allow institutions to validate and apply them to their individual care setting. The proposal is supported by strong mentorship from experts in quality measure design, informatics, advanced NLP, CDS design, and qualitative research methodology. The facilities at Yale Center of Outcomes Research and Evaluation, which designs and evaluates national quality measures, and has access to computational resources required to accomplish the research goals as well as to the Yale EHR to validate the models are major strengths of the application. The proposed period of mentored research will support Dr. Khera’s training in medical informatics, advanced analytic tools such as NLP, and qualitative research methodology. The experience and skillset acquired during this period will support Dr. Khera’s transition to independence where he plans to lead multi-institutional collaboratives to evaluate the use of automated tools in the measurement and improvement of the quality of medical care in HF. The career development plan that accompanies the proposal is designed to support Dr. Khera’s long-term career goal to be a national leader in the design and implementation of informatics- based approaches of delivering high quality, patient-centered, cardiovascular care. PROJECT NARRATIVE The scope of quality improvement programs that focus on improving the utilization of first-line evidence-based medical therapies in patients with heart failure is limited by mechanisms to identify those who are eligible for specific treatments. The current proposal aims to design automated tools to identify patients eligible for heart failure therapies using various data components already captured in the electronic health record in hospitalized patients. The proposal will then pilot test strategies of improving treatment utilization with electronic alerts delivered to clinicians based on these tools.",Evaluating and Improving Utilization of Evidence-Based Medical Therapy in Patients with Heart Failure using Automated Tools in the Electronic Health Record,10214973,K23HL153775,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Angiotensins', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Automation', 'Bradycardia', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Coughing', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Low Cardiac Output', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mineralocorticoid Receptor', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neprilysin', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical tool', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'hospitalization rates', 'hyperkalemia', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'open source', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tool']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193510
"Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home Abstract Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause for both hospitalizations and readmissions in the Medicare program. HF’s high mortality rate and high hospitalization utilization rate via readmissions results in a large economic burden currently estimated at over $30B, and prevalence of HF is expected to continue rising by 46% by 2030. There is an opportunity to deploy remote patient monitoring (RPM) tools for measuring prognostic biomarkers of worsening HF and acute decompensation and hospital readmission. Bender Tech (BT) has developed a urine testing platform capable of easily attaching to a home-toilet for accurate and easy collection of longitudinal health and behavior data without the requirement of manual sample collection and/or testing. We propose to adapt our system for use in elderly HF patient populations by rendering data collection and transmission completely passive. We propose to integrate sensors and firmware capable of identifying when a user has used their home toilet (Specific Aim 1), develop the machine learning (ML) classification algorithms necessary for determining when to perform a testing sequence (Specific Aim 2), and use ML methods to demonstrate feasibility of user biometric identification via urinary testing data (Specific Aim 3). A successful outcome of this proposal will be a set of classification models built using ML techniques designed to enable passive collection of longitudinal urine profile data from a home-toilet for use in remotely managing elderly HF patients. This will ready the product for prospective clinical trials that would be the subject of a future phase II submission for use in remotely monitoring diuretic effectiveness and preventing hospital readmissions. Project Narrative Remotely stratifying risk of worsening heart failure and predicting imminent decompensation and hospitalizations using remote patient monitoring devices can help lower healthcare costs and improve lives for the elderly living with heart failure at home. Longitudinal urinary trend data of physiologically important markers, such as spot sodium tests, have been shown to help classify potentially stable heart failure patients, predict acute decompensation, and measure diuretic effectiveness via relative changes from baseline measurements. Bender Tech proposes to integrate the hardware and machine learning methods necessary to render its internet- connected home urine testing platform completely passive to enable use by the elderly HF population and obviate any need for device interaction for data collection and transmission.","Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home",10187779,R43HL157937,"['Acute', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Defecation', 'Devices', 'Diuretics', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Potassium', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Sodium', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Treatment Failure', 'Urination', 'Urine', 'Use Effectiveness', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'experience', 'health data', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'remote monitoring', 'remote patient monitoring', 'risk stratification', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tool', 'trend', 'unsupervised learning', 'urinary']",NHLBI,"BENDER TECH, LLC",R43,2021,224996
"Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning PROJECT ABSTRACT Heart transplantation is a life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure, a devastating disease which kills over 250,000 Americans each year. Unfortunately, the supply of deceased donor hearts cannot meet demand, and over a third of candidates will die or be delisted without transplant. In the context of such scarcity, allocation must make the best use of scarce deceased donor hearts by ranking candidates from most to least medically urgent. In contrast to other organ transplant systems, there is currently no objective score used to rank heart transplant candidates on the waitlist. Instead, each candidate’s priority for transplantation is based on “Status,” a designation determined by the supportive therapy prescribed by their transplant center. I have previously shown that some heart transplant centers appear to overtreat candidates with intensive therapies at far higher rates than other centers. My preliminary data demonstrates that these practices have consequences for heart allocation effectiveness. High survival benefit centers reserve intense supportive therapy for candidates who have poor prognoses without transplant, saving lives by prioritizing the sickest patients. In contrast, low survival benefit centers list stable candidates and escalate the use of supportive therapies. Based on these data, there is a clear need for a new system to fairly allocate donor hearts. The overall objective of this K08 application is to develop and simulate a novel Heart Allocation Score (HAS) designed to objectively identify the candidates who gain the greatest survival benefit from heart transplantation. Previous attempts to develop such a score using conventional statistical methods have been inaccurate, but cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques outperform conventional regression models in many clinical contexts. In addition, a new open-source Heart Simulated Allocation Model (HSAM) is needed to compare policy alternatives because the available program is closed-source, inflexible, outdated, and structurally unable to simulate allocation scores developed with ML. My overall hypothesis is that a HAS developed with ML will lead to policy that optimizes heart allocation. I will test this hypothesis in three Aims. In Aim 1, I will use the complete national transplant registry dataset (N = 109,315 adult candidates) to predict waitlist survival, comparing ML prediction models to the current therapy-based system. In Aim 2, I will use the same registry to predict post-transplant survival for heart recipients, comparing conventional statistical methods to ML. In Aim 3, I will develop a) a new, open-source HSAM which I will use to b) compare current policy to a novel HAS policy constructed from the best prediction models from Aim 1 & 2. My overall career goal is to save lives by designing delivery systems that fairly and efficiently distribute scarce medical resources. To accomplish this, I plan to earn a PhD in Health Services Research focused on ML, simulation modeling, and health policy. Achieving the goals of this proposal will lead to the foundation of a novel heart allocation system that has the potential to save lives and equip me with the skills needed for future R01- level applications in the field of scarce healthcare resource allocation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Heart transplantation is a potentially life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure but unfortunately donors are scarce and only a fortunate minority of patients receive hearts. Current heart allocation policy relies on the intensity of treatment to decide who receives a heart, but this system cannot consistently identify the sickest candidates who stand to benefit the most from heart transplantation. This proposal aims to improve heart allocation by 1) developing a data-driven, objective heart allocation score with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and 2) building novel, more flexible simulation software.",Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning,10088470,K08HL150291,"['Adult', 'American', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'models and simulation', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'organ allocation', 'organ procurement transplantation network', 'post-transplant', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'risk stratification', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'skills', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2021,157896
"Elucidating hereditary transthyretin-mediated heart failure risk using machine learning, polygenic risk and recall by genotype approaches in African ancestry individuals PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Mutations in the Transthyretin (TTR) gene can lead to deposition of abnormal amyloid fibrils in the myocardium, resulting in hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) and leading to heart failure. Targeted therapies for hATTR-CM have recently been developed and have shown to improve mortality and hospitalization.  Recently, we led a study (Journal of American Medical Association, Dec 2019) that showed that the TTR V122I mutation, commonly observed in racial/ethnic minorities (4% in African Americans (AAs) and 1% in Hispanic Americans (HAs)), confers two-fold increased risk of heart failure. Despite this strong effect, only 11% of V122I carriers with heart failure were appropriately diagnosed with hATTR-CM, suggesting marked underdiagnosis and mis-diagnosis of the disease. We further showed subclinical evidence of echocardiographic derangements in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers, suggesting early signs can occur well before onset of disease.  We propose to extend our prior work by addressing knowledge gaps which are necessary for targeted therapies to attain their full potential. These include: understanding the incomplete penetrance of V122I; identifying V122I carriers in large health care systems where genotyping is not common; and understanding subclinical disease burden. In Aim 1, we will examine the interplay between a polygenic risk score, which are comprised of millions of single nucleotide variants with small effects, and V122I, a monogenic mutation with a single strong effect, analyzed in conjunction with clinical risk factors on heart failure in in 6,609 AAs and 9,006 HAs in the BioMe biobank and 5,833 AAs in the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB). In Aim 2, we will apply machine learning tools to multi-modal electronic health record (EHR) data to identify V122I carriers in ~8 million patients from an electronic health record (EHR) data repository at Mount Sinai. In Aim 3, we will evaluate subclinical effects of amyloid deposition on cardiac structural/functional traits in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers by recalling V122I carriers for imaging evaluation including research-grade echocardiograms, cardiac magnetic resonance and technetium nuclear scanning.  The proposal is innovative because we are utilizing two large diverse ancestry EHR-linked biobanks from academic health systems (BioMe at Mount Sinai, and PMBB at University of Pennsylvania), along with adopting cutting-edge methods including multi-ethnic polygenic risk scores, and machine learning approaches on multi-modal EHR data. We further propose patient recall based on genotypes and perform deep phenotyping using comprehensive heart imaging scans.  This proposal has the potential to realize the potential of precision medicine for heart failure in racial/ethnic minorities by informing clinical care, population management, risk stratification and clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Transthyretin V122I, is a highly penetrant mutation for hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) that is common in African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Recent therapies have been approved to treat hATTR-CM, which have led to decreased mortality; thus, understanding who will develop hATTR-CM, accurate identification of V122I carriers and understanding hidden disease burden is important. In this proposal, we examine the population health impact of V122I using polygenic risk scores, machine learning approaches on electronic health records, and patient recall by genotype, which can lead to new population health strategies for heart failure in racial and ethnic minorities.","Elucidating hereditary transthyretin-mediated heart failure risk using machine learning, polygenic risk and recall by genotype approaches in African ancestry individuals",10101075,R01HL155915,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'African', 'African American', 'Age', 'American Medical Association', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Fibrils', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caribbean Hispanic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diphosphates', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Onset of illness', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prealbumin', 'Quality of life', 'Recontacts', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supportive care', 'Technetium', 'Technetium 99m', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'data repository', 'disease diagnosis', 'ethnic minority population', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'polygenic risk score', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'risk stratification', 'scale up', 'screening', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,770230
"Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), characterized by heart failure symptoms with normal ejection fraction, is highly prevalent. However, most HFpEF patients do not respond to standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and there are no clear and uniform diagnostic criteria to stratify and differentiate HFpEF from HFrEF. Therefore, there is a pressing unmet need for us to better understand HFpEF at the molecular and system levels. Unbiased approaches such as machine learning (ML) offer a powerful means to tease out the molecular signatures of HFpEF in relevant disease models. The emerging evidence implicates that metabolism and redox homeostasis are two significant disruptions in cellular processes evidenced by clinical symptoms of HFpEF. Previous studies have identified branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic defect as another major metabolic hallmark in heart failure as well as in metabolic disorders. Moreover, BCAA catabolic defects have been demonstrated to directly impact mitochondrial function and elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in oxidative stress-sensitive post-translational modifications (O-PTMs) that govern protein function and pathways. These exciting discoveries lead to our new hypothesis that O-PTM-mediated proteome remodeling is a dynamic and pervasive molecular change in diseased hearts, affecting proteins with central function in cardiac homeostasis and pathophysiology. To investigate the unique molecular features and pathogenic mechanisms of HFpEF, we highlight a novel HFpEF mouse model that incorporates both genetic predisposition for obesity/diabetes and pressure-overload, the two major risk factors for HFpEF, by performing trans-aortic constriction (TAC) in the ob/ob mice. We have also perfected the experimental tools and data analysis platform to provide O-PTM profiling at the whole-proteome level in hearts. Accordingly, we have strategically formulated the following aims according to three phenotypic levels: At the systemic level, Aim 1 will establish and characterize in vivo mouse models of HFpEF vs. HFrEF by cardiac and mitochondrial function as well as redox status. At the organellar level, Aim 2 will conduct targeted proteomics profiling of the cardiac mitochondria and extract O-PTM signatures using ML-based methods to achieve deep phenotyping of HFpEF and HFrEF. This information will then be integrated and enriched in an O- PTM molecular atlas and knowledge graph. At the molecular level, Aim 3 will target the BCAA catabolic pathway to exhaustively scrutinize its role in HFpEF and HFrEF. A multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE HFpEF is highly prevalent, yet there are few effective treatments or clear criteria to differentiate it from HFrEF. We propose to extract molecular signatures unique to HFpEF and HFrEF using a novel HFpEF mouse model and machine learning-based approaches. We anticipate that a multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway,10183311,R01HL146739,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Biology', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Cardiac', 'Catabolism', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Defect', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'EFRAC', 'Enzymes', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glucose', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Homeostasis', 'Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mus', 'Myocardium', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thinness', 'Treatment Failure', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'antioxidant enzyme', 'base', 'computational platform', 'constriction', 'effective therapy', 'empowered', 'exhaustion', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'heart function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'knowledge graph', 'men', 'molecular phenotype', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'protein function', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,649707
"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record. The goal is to develop a low-risk, clinically validated method to estimate dynamic heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization.",Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting,10086491,K23HL135274,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Age-Years', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Self Administration', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'behavior change', 'big biomedical data', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'digital', 'digital medicine', 'experience', 'functional status', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preempt', 'prevent', 'professor', 'risk prediction', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,203678
"Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern PI: Valentina Kutyifa, MD, PhD University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY Morbidity, mortality, and health care costs of the treatment of systolic heart failure (HF) are rapidly increasing. Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) is cost-effectively reducing HF events and death in HF patients with a wide QRS and low ejection fraction. However, response to CRT-D is not unequivocally present in all patients, with less benefit in those without the presence of an ECG abnormality, left bundle branch block (non-LBBB), posing a significant treatment challenge. Because of the conflicting and limited data on response to CRT-D in this cohort, it is possible that we currently treat a large proportion of HF patients with non-LBBB who have limited or no benefit from the device. Therefore, better selection of patients for this expensive therapy is warranted. One of our recent studies suggested a clinical benefit in patients with non-LBBB and marked echocardiography response, and identified predictors. However, there is a need to prospectively validate these predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D in non-LBBB in this hard-to-treat patient population, and identify potential novel ECG and echocardiography predictors, utilizing novel statistical methods of machine learning. We propose a prospective, observational, single-arm study in a currently guideline-indicated cohort to validate and identify predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D, including novel ECG and echocardiography markers, and to assess subsequent clinical outcomes in 270 HF patients with an implanted CRT-D and non-LBBB ECG pattern. The primary aim of the study is to prospectively validating our previously identified clinical predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D in HF patients with non-LBBB that could enable better patient selection. Our secondary aim is to identify the incremental value of novel ECG and echocardiography variables to predict echocardiography response to CRT-D in non-LBBB patients, including ECG variables of sum absolute QRST integral and ventricular electrical activation delay, and echocardiography-derived variables of left ventricular dyssynchrony and contractility. Then we will apply the developed predictive model to prospectively identify non- LBBB patients with CRT-D at a risk of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or death. Tertiary aim is to identify novel ECG and echocardiography predictors of response in non-LBBB using machine learning analysis. Study population will include 270 HF patients with non-LBBB (135 with mild HF and 135 with advanced HF) and an implanted CRT-D with 6 months echocardiography follow-up analyzed by an echocardiography core lab, and assessing clinical outcomes of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or death. Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) in heart failure (HF) patients without left bundle branch block (non-LBBB) has been less beneficial to improve outcomes despite being a guideline indicated therapy, posing a significant treatment challenge. However, non-LBBB patients with echocardiography response to CRT-D have better outcomes, and pre-implant variables could predict response, identifying patients who benefit the most. In this study, we plan to enroll 270 HF patients with non-LBBB and guideline- indicated CRT-D implantation to validate our prior echocardiography predictor score, and to identify novel ECG and echocardiography predictors using conventional statistics and machine learning analysis. We will also assess the applicability of such a score for clinical outcomes of HF, ventricular arrhythmias, or death.",Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern,10207993,R01HL153390,"['Attenuated', 'Biological', 'Bundle-Branch Block', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defibrillators', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mosses', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Ventricular End-Systolic Volumes', 'arm', 'base', 'cardiac implant', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'kidney dysfunction', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'statistics', 'study population']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2021,734112
"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"Generalizable prediction of medication adherence in heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) is associated with high rates of hospitalization and mortality. While a number of evidence- based therapies have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with HF, nearly half of these patients are not regularly taking their medications. Although medication adherence can be improved through timely interventions, it is challenging for clinicians to accurately identify and predict medication non-adherence at the point of care. The challenge persists partly because medication adherence is a complex process influenced by an interplay of a multitude of patient-, provider-, system-, community-, and therapy-related factors. This gap in identifying patients at risk of non-adherence can be addressed through increasing availability of relevant data from electronic health records (EHRs), which affords the potential to make accurate, real time predictions of adherence in HF. In particular, recent linkages of EHR and pharmacy data has created opportunity for incorporation of prior medication fills into EHR-based adherence prediction models that are updated continuously. Using machine learning (ML) techniques with such data allows for incorporation of a large number of intercorrelated risk factors and their interactions into models and for accommodating continuous updates as new information becomes available. Our objective is to build a ML-based algorithm to predict adherence among patients with HF. The specific aims are: 1) to develop supervised ML algorithms to predict medication adherence among HF patients, using EHR clinical data, linked pharmacy fill data, and location- based social determinants data from a large, urban health system that cares for a diverse patient population; 2) to assess fairness of the developed algorithms by evaluating cross-validated prediction and calibration on patient subgroups based on social and economic factors, to ensure that the desirable prediction performance is maintained for the diverse groups; and 3) to assess generalizability of the algorithms through validation in a second large, urban health system caring for a diverse population. Our approach is innovative and novel in several ways. First, we will take advantage of linkages between pharmacy fill information and the EHR to incorporate pharmacy data in our models. Second, we utilize geocoding of patient addresses combined with publicly available data to incorporate neighborhood-level social determinants of health, which are among the most important predictors of adherence, into our models. Third, we will assess fairness of the model by evaluating the predictive performance and calibration on patients from diverse backgrounds. Fourth, we will ensure generalizability of the prediction algorithm by developing it in one diverse health system and validating the algorithm in a second diverse health system. These models will be developed such that they can be used for point-of-care adherence prediction. Our long term goal is to be able to implement them into the EHR, at which point they can be incorporated into interventions to address medication adherence and, ultimately, improve both adherence and clinical outcomes for patients with HF. Project Narrative Poor medication adherence in heart failure can lead to poor health, but many clinicians are unable to determine who would benefit from interventions to address adherence. We will build machine learning models to identify patients at risk of not taking their medicines using an approach that minimizes potential biases. Electronic health record data will be used in these models, allowing them to be incorporated into interventions to improve medication adherence and reduce the disease burden of heart failure.",Generalizable prediction of medication adherence in heart failure,10095553,R01HL155149,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Development', 'Economic Factors', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Update', 'Urban Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'contextual factors', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication compliance', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,690075
"Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) 30-day readmissions generate over a third of HF healthcare costs in the US and are the leading cause of US 30-day readmissions. Drivers of HF readmissions include increasing complexity associated with clinical, social, and behavioral factors. Despite numerous interventions, readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these could be prevented by a multidisciplinary approach promoting better connections to and communication with clinical care teams while addressing social and behavioral barriers to HF care. Community health workers (CHWs) are members of medical teams who address social, behavioral, and basic clinical factors influencing health outcomes while fostering patient connections to and communication with care teams. CHW care is one of a few interventions shown to reduce readmissions in patients with chronic disease. However, CHW care relies on intensive 1:1 patient care models that do not leverage technology which limits efficiency and scalability. There has been limited attention on developing technology-based interventions in CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. A HF mobile phone application-based digital platform that utilizes artificial intelligence driven biometric data to minimize false alarms, promotes early identification of true decline, and encourages communication with providers was developed in 2016 to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Preliminary clinical trial data for the digital platform has been promising. A prototype designed for patients with HF and the CHWs caring for them has recently been created. The current proposal will assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Aim 1: Identify behavioral (e.g., diet, activity) and social (e.g., socioeconomic status, social supports, living situation) factors that influence HF outcomes relevant to a digitally-enabled CHW intervention by performing semi-structured interviews with 30 patients with HF and 20 CHWs. Aim 2: Test usability of a digitally- enabled CHW intervention (focused on CHW workflow integration) in 10 patients with HF in an open pilot trial. Aim 3: Assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of implementing a digitally-enabled CHW intervention compared to CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions within a pilot RCT (n=50). The candidate’s overall career goals are: to identify social and behavioral drivers of HF/cardiovascular clinical outcomes; to develop expertise in qualitative methods, behavioral science, and RCTs; and ultimately, to develop interventions that improve care and reduce costs in HF/cardiovascular disease and other NHLBI diseases seen by generalists. This training plan includes strong mentorship, formal coursework, and scientific meetings with cohesive training in behavioral and social sciences, qualitative research, and the conduction of RCTs. This proposal investigates a potentially transformative intervention that addresses important gaps in the literature by assessing the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention in reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement. Project Narrative: Despite ongoing efforts to improve outcomes in heart failure (HF), a leading cause of mortality and elevated healthcare costs, 30-day HF readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these are preventable. Community health worker (CHW) care delivery has been shown to improve healthcare outcomes but inefficiency limits its scalability. Implementation of a 30-day digitally-enabled CHW intervention for HF patients may provide support for similar interventions in larger HF/cardiovascular populations by reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement.",Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure,10084315,K23HL150287,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Community Health Aides', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Research', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Team', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Singapore', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral/social science', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinical care', 'cohesion', 'comorbidity', 'comparison intervention', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'health difference', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient engagement', 'pilot trial', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'readmission rates', 'social', 'social factors', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,198857
"Multimorbidity and Treatment-Related Outcomes in Older Heart Failure Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is the most common reason for hospitalization in older adults. Over 85% of all patients hospitalized with HF are 65 years of age or older. Multimorbidity, typically defined as the presence of ≥2 chronic conditions, increases the risks of hospitalization and death in older HF patients, and greatly complicates the clinical management of HF. Caution is required in applying national clinical practice guidelines to the care of older adults with multimorbidity, as this could result in undesirable net effects and less than optimal outcomes including adverse interactions between drugs and various concomitant diseases. In response to PA-17-088 (Exploratory Analyses of Existing Cohorts, Data Sets, and Stored Biospecimens to Address Clinical Aging Research Questions, R01), we propose to leverage an existing HF cohort, including data for more than 100,000 patients with HF within the Cardiovascular Research Network between 2005-2012, with follow-up data up to 2017. We will extend our previous efforts by examining treatment patterns and the net benefits versus harms of selected therapies in older adults with HF and a wide spectrum of multimorbidity burden. We will further examine the benefits and adverse outcomes of various therapies focusing on particularly vulnerable subgroups of patients with HF afflicted by two prevalent conditions, anemia or diabetes. Our specific aims are: (1) to examine the effectiveness of selected medical therapies (renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system blockers, beta-blockers, diuretics, and aldosterone receptor blockers) on death, HF hospitalization, and all-cause hospitalizations in a large, community-based population of older adults with HF across a range of levels of multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction; (2) to evaluate targeted adverse outcomes, including kidney dysfunction, hyperkalemia, sodium disturbances, bradycardia, and syncope associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF, stratified by multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction status; and (3) to characterize the potential benefits and adverse outcomes associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF and two prevalent comorbidity dyads—HF- diabetes and HF-anemia—that are common and substantially increase the risks of death and morbidity. In addition, we will create novel, validated methods to identify adverse outcomes related to HF therapies from unstructured data in large electronic health record systems through natural language processing technology, along with employing state-of-the-art analytic approaches to evaluate treatment-related outcomes. In that our proposed investigation will take advantage of a large, geographically and demographically diverse cohort of adults with HF receiving care within community-based healthcare delivery systems, we anticipate our findings will be highly generalizable to the broad spectrum of older adults with HF managed in “real-world” practice settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The presence of multiple chronic conditions, or multimorbidity, in older adults with heart failure substantially increases the complexity of their care, and increases the risks of hospitalization and death. In our study, we will examine treatment patterns and the net benefits versus harms of selected therapies in patients with heart failure and multimorbidity.
