"Genetic and Genomic Dissection of Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is distinctive amongst the inflammatory/autoimmune joint diseases in that its onset is commonly preceded by cutaneous psoriasis (PsC). This provides an unparalleled opportunity for the identification of predictive biomarkers to determine which of the approximately 25% of psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) patients will develop PsA. Over the past decade, we have expanded our genetic study of PsV to focus on PsA, resulting in the collection of 1,279 PsA patients at Michigan, 743 of whom have already been subjected to GWAS. Initiated in 2007, the International Psoriatic Arthritis Research Team (IPART) has accumulated 1,919 Canadian PsA patients, of whom 1,370 have already been subjected to GWAS. In 2015, we completed a meta- GWAS of PsC and PsA involving a discovery cohort of 1,430 PsA cases and 1,417 controls, with 9,293 additional PsV replication samples (3,061 PsA, 3,110 PsC) and 13,670 controls. We detected 10 associations for PsA and 11 for PsC, as well as a new association for PsV. Utilizing an innovative core exome array to genotype additional cases and controls, we carried out the largest meta-GWAS of PsV to date (~40,000 subjects) and found 16 more susceptibility regions, highlighting the roles of interferon signaling and the NFB cascade, and demonstrating strong enrichment for psoriasis genetic signals in T-cell regulatory elements. Using machine learning to model ~200 genetic variants in our PsA vs. PsC GWAS, we achieved 82% area under receiver operator curve for distinguishing PsA vs PsC, with 98% accuracy among the top 10% of patients with the highest genetic load. We also carried out RNA-seq on mRNA and miRNA from 65 pairs of pre- and post-conversion samples from PsC patients who developed PsA. Suggestive of a shift from skin- focused to systemic autoimmunity, we found significant post-conversion enrichment for central memory CD4+ T-cell (CD4-Tcm) transcripts among the up-regulated genes. We also observed highly correlated pre- and post- conversion behaviors of 54 differentially-expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets, as well as multiple serum miRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed in PsA vs. PsC. A metabolomic study of 50 paired converter sera revealed 293 biochemicals with significant alterations, 275 of which were increased. Finally, we identified noncoding eQTLs for IL23R that correlate strikingly with a region of selective PsA association.  Based on these results, we hypothesize that PsA and PsC have pathogenetic mechanisms that are T-cell, osteoblast and osteoclast-driven and progress from skin to systemic during transition to PsA. We propose that this paradigm can be used to develop a useful test to predict PsA in PsC patients, while increasing our basic understanding of PsA. To test this hypothesis, we propose four aims: (1) to maintain and grow our longitudinal clinical resource; (2) To identify biomarkers for the development of PsA in PsC patients; (3) To integrate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2 into a clinically-useful tool for PsA identification using machine learning ; and (4) to explore the mechanisms by which the IL23R gene contributes to PsA pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a major health problem in the United States and around the world. The mechanisms that predispose patients with psoriasis to develop PsA are unknown. The proposed research will utilize the power of genome-wide association studies, transcriptome analysis, metabolomics, and the largest longitudinal resource of PsA in the world to develop a clinically-relevant tool for PsA prediction and to address a major gap in our mechanistic understanding of the causes of PsA. The results of this research are also likely to be relevant to other autoimmune diseases.",Genetic and Genomic Dissection of Psoriatic Arthritis,10208711,R01AR063611,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Banks', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chronic small plaque psoriasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dermatology', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Michigan', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteoclasts', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Predisposition', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'RNA', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'STAT3 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Suggestion', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'TYK2', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'differential expression', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory CD4 T lymphocyte', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'osteoblast differentiation', 'predictive marker', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'systemic autoimmunity', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,608486
"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,10129203,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'fly', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2021,336445
"Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL—PROJECT SUMMARY Healthspan is a complex trait, influenced by many interacting polymorphic alleles and environmental factors that may accelerate or delay aging, reduce or increase disease risk, and/or promote extended lifespan. Thus, assessing the role of genetic variation in aging requires an experimental strategy capable of modeling the genetic and biological complexity of human populations while allowing for efficient identification and validation of candidate genes. With this proposal, the JAX NSC seeks support to further develop and disseminate the next generation of genetic, phenotyping, and information resources necessary to enable a systems-wide approach to understanding healthy aging. Over the past 15 years, The JAX NSC has transformed aging research both at JAX and across the geroscience community, providing central resources to support investigators that have resulted in 26 peer-reviewed publications in the last funding period. The Center has developed nascent regional and national resources for aging research, including aging mouse resources and tissues that support our numerous collaborations and external researchers. All JAX NSC data and tools are publicly disseminated on the Mouse Phenome Database and the JAX NSC website, thus ensuring that the resources generated and expertise acquired through the Center is readily available to the aging research community. In this renewal, we will advance towards our goal by providing unique resources, tools, and support to geroscience investigators while leveraging JAX's unparalleled expertise in the large-scale identification and functional validation of complex polygenic traits in mice. We will do this by providing effective Center administration and enhancing the utility of JAX NSC resources throughout the aging community (Aim 1); expanding the research focus on aging, healthspan and age-related diseases through a robust Research Development Core (Aim 2); increasing the diversity of mouse resources available for aging research, including a new study to, for the first time, investigate the effect of genetic variation on cellular senescence and treatment with senolytic drugs (Aim 3); strengthening the data and computational and support available to the aging community (Aim 4); expanding the use of machine learning technologies in interpretation of aging pathologies (Aim 5). The Center will be led by a highly experienced team of Principal Investigators and Core Leaders who, with oversight from an External Advisory Board, will provide effective management to facilitate the goals and objectives of the Center. The Center will leverage unparalleled institutional resources, facilities and expertise of The Jackson Laboratory, a globally renowned institution for mouse genetics research, to enhance its goals and the utility of the resources it generates for the aging research community. OVERALL—PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Human aging is influenced by genetic factors, whereby differences in longevity as well as changes in health and disease risk with time are linked to variation in individuals' genetic codes. The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center will develop resources to encourage the use of a wider range of mouse models in aging research. Resources—including aged mouse models that mirror human genetic variation, metabolic and microbiome data, and methods to reveal genetic factors tied to human aging—will be available to the scientific community, accelerating research to understand and ultimately prolong healthy human aging.",Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging,10261436,P30AG038070,"['Advisory Committees', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biology of Aging', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Aging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Variation', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'age related', 'aged', 'animal tissue', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'candidate validation', 'career development', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data tools', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'healthspan', 'healthy aging', 'insight', 'microbiome', 'mouse genetics', 'mouse model', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'response', 'senescence', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIA,JACKSON LABORATORY,P30,2021,1069526
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,10112878,R01DC011805,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'side effect', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2021,696730
"The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms Project Summary  Recent years have witnessed the development of large research projects that involve  genotyping hundreds of thousands of individuals, on which we have available detailed medical records. Examples include the All of us research project, the Million Veteran Program, and the UKBiobank resource. Often, whole-genome sequencing data is also available for a substantial fraction of the individuals. These large samples, with their precise genotypic and phenotypic information, give us the opportunity to bring our understanding of the relations between genetic variation and traits of medical interest to the next level.  While the initial small sample sizes available for genome wide association studies (GWAS) motivated analyses that were approximative in nature, we are now in the position to probe more closely the genetic causal mechanisms underlying medically relevant phenotypes. We can aspire to distinguish variants that have causal effects from those that are associated because of linkage disequilibrium or population structure. Indeed, we need to pay even greater attention to the implications of hidden confounders: even small effects become significant when sample sizes are large enough.  Increasing the resolution with which we can describe causal mechanisms will result in the identification of clearer targets for drug development. It will also improve the precision of  personalized risk evaluations based on genotypes: if we can construct risk scores using variants that are truly causal, their performance will remain solid across ethnicities and environmental exposures.  To zoom in on genetic variants with causal effects, this project will leverage a set of new statistical methodologies that the investigators have recently introduced. These new approaches are remarkably flexible, in that they do not rely on specific assumptions of how phenotypes are linked to genetic variants. Indeed, they allow researchers to capitalize on powerful machine learning algorithms and, crucially, equip their results with precise replicability guarantees.  We have assembled a diverse and complementary team, including experts in statistical  genomics, methodological statistics and computer science, with a strong record both of software development and genetic data analysis. A postdoctoral scholar and two graduate students will contribute to the research program, and the interdisciplinary training they will acquire in  statistics, computation and genetics will add another substantial benefit. Personalized medicine strives to provide treatments that are fine-tuned to the patients, aware both of the specificity of their diseases as well as of the individuals’ background characteristics. In order to achieve this promise, identifying those genes and mutations that influence the medically relevant traits is an important tool: it gives us the opportunity to understand the biological pathways involved, inspires drug development, informs treatment and counseling and facilitates prevention. The proposed research would develop new methods of statistical analysis to harness the information contained in large datasets, increasing our ability to distinguish the genetic mutations that directly impact phenotypes, from those that are merely correlated with traits of interest.",The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms,10291186,R56HG010812,"['Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computer science', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'polygenic risk score', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'sex', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,455280
"Using Genetic Diversity to Manage Neurological Disease Project Summary/Abstract Understanding and treating genome abnormalities that lead to rare genetic neurodegenerative diseases such as Niemann-Pick C1 globally managing cholesterol homeostasis, or APOE alleles impacting cholesterol homeostasis in the brain triggering late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), present a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We have developed a Gaussian process regression (GPR) based machine learning (ML) approach that captures for the first time genomic variation in the population to understand the spatial covariance (SCV) relationships contributing to sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual. Genetic disease is fundamentally a problem of understanding the impact of altered folding intermediates found in response to variation in the protein fold and how they are managed by proteostasis. Proteostasis encompasses a broad range of chaperone and degradative components that manage the synthesis, folding/stability and function of the protein fold in response to inherited and environmental stress and aging. The general premise of this proposal is to develop a deep genome-based understanding of proteostasis that will teach us how to manage genetic diseases triggered by folding stress. The rationale for this proposal is that sparse genetic diversity found in the population, when used as a collective through application of GRP-ML defined SCV relationships, can provide us on a residue-by-residue basis insight into the folding intermediates that contribute to disease for the entire polypeptide sequence. The objective of this proposal is to understand the role of proteostasis in managing this genetic diversity for the benefit of therapeutic intervention. We hypothesize that management of the polypeptide fold of disease-causing variant proteins found in the population by targeting the function of the multivalent Hsp40 and Hsp70 co-chaperone/chaperone branch (the Hsp70 axis) of the proteostasis network will enable precision correction of misfolding phenotypes found in neurodegenerative disease. Our approach will study the impact of variation in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene. NPC1 is an inherited, autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomal (LE) and lysosome (Ly) compartments of all cell types. The primary effect of NPC1 variation results in early onset neurodegenerative disease in response to loss of cholesterol homeostasis. In Aim 1 we will explore the ability of small molecules to allosterically regulate the activity of components of the Hsp70 axis to retune the synthesis, folding/stability, trafficking and/or function of NPC1 variants. In Aim 2 we will explore the molecular mechanism of action (MoA) of the Hsp70 axis components that are responsible for enabling NPC1 variant correction. Completion of both aims will generate a comprehensive assessment of the role of Hsp70 axis in NPC1 disease progression and will be used as a guide for advancement of a precision medicine approach to reduce or prevent the onset of neurodegenerative disease triggered by genomic variation in NPC1 population. Project Narrative Understanding the mechanism behind and treatment of genome abnormalities in the population that cause rare genetic disease in the individual represents a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We will study the impact of genetic variation found in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene, that, like APOE alleles driving late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD), is responsible for management of cholesterol homeostasis. We will use Gaussian process regression machine learning (GPR-ML) based spatial covariance (SCV) tools to define the mechanism of action of proteostasis components found in the Hsp70 axis to therapeutically manage the NPC1 fold leading to improved to cholesterol homeostasis in the individual to provide basic and clinical insight into disease management.",Using Genetic Diversity to Manage Neurological Disease,10100560,R01AG070209,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Sciences', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Cholesterol Homeostasis', 'Clinical', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'GRP gene', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heat-Shock Proteins 70', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Action', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Niemann-Pick Diseases', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Ubiquitin', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'biochemical tools', 'biophysical tools', 'cell type', 'cholesterol control', 'druggable target', 'early onset', 'fitness', 'genomic variation', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'polypeptide', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein misfolding', 'proteostasis', 'rare genetic disorder', 'rare variant', 'response', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,443750
"Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures,10140420,R00MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive signature', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R00,2021,248878
"Establishing the Role of Genetic Variation in Vitamin D Regulated Gene Expression in MS Pathogenesis and Severity Project Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that destroys the protective myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells, and its cause is unknown. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, leading to the hypothesis that sun exposure, and consequently vitamin D exposure, has a protective effect on MS risk. Recent studies utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis have demonstrated strong evidence for a causal role of low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in MS pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the association are unknown. It is well established that 25(OH)D signaling operates through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. VDRs recognize specific binding sites in DNA, leading to activation or suppression of a target gene. Previous research has found that genetic variation of tagging SNPs (VDR-BVs) within these VDR binding sites, can alter binding affinity. These VDR-BVs are enriched in genomic regions associated with MS, as well as with several other autoimmune diseases, which suggests regulation of specific genes mediated by vitamin D could affect MS risk and severity. No formal investigation of genetic variation of individual VDR-BVs in MS cases and controls has been reported and VDR-BVs are strong candidates to investigate for genetic variation relevant to MS. The overall objective of this F31 application is to estimate the effect of VDR-BVs on MS risk and severity. We hypothesize that genetic variation in VDR-BVs is associated with MS susceptibility and severity, and further, that the effect of this genetic variation on MS is modulated by bioavailability of vitamin D. Our approach will use a dataset of approximately 10,000 clinically definite MS cases and 35,000 controls frequency matched on age and race/ethnicity with whole genome genotypes, demographic, clinical, and environmental exposure data and will: 1) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs near established MS risk loci and MS risk and severity; 2) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs across the human genome and MS risk and severity; and 3) Replicate findings in independent datasets of MS cases and controls and combine replicated associations across all datasets via meta-analysis. VDR-BVs were previously identified through ChIP-seq analysis in Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines and we will use machine learning to prioritize candidate VDR-BVs for Aim 2. Analyses will incorporate a genetic instrumental variable as measure of 25(OH)D bioavailability to test for interaction between VDR-BVs and 25(OH)D bioavailability. Results from the proposed aims will determine whether MS GWAS findings are partially explained by genetic variation in VDR binding affinity, identify genetic risk factors for MS related to vitamin D, and identify new genes and regulatory pathways involved in the development of MS. Ultimately, the goal of this work understand the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects this immune- mediated neurological disorder. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease that results in significant disability and decreased quality of life with both genetic and environmental risk factors. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, and recent research has demonstrated evidence supporting a causal role for low vitamin D in MS risk and disease severity. The objective of this F31 fellowship application is to identify and characterize vitamin D binding sites that are associated with susceptibility to MS and disease severity.",Establishing the Role of Genetic Variation in Vitamin D Regulated Gene Expression in MS Pathogenesis and Severity,10145491,F31NS113537,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'California', 'ChIP-seq', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Investigation', 'Ligands', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Study Subject', 'Sun Exposure', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Vitamin D3 Receptor', 'Work', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disability', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'multiple datasets', 'nervous system disorder', 'pediatric multiple sclerosis', 'programs', 'protective effect', 'receptor binding', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2021,42076
"Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations ABSTRACT During normal development, aging, and diseases such as cancer, DNA damage due to endogenous and external factors, and repair defects result in accumulation of different types of somatic mutations including single nucleotide substitutions, small InDels, copy number alterations, translocations, and ploidy changes. While a vast majority of somatic mutations in the genome are not disease drivers, their patterns of genetic changes and associated context can provide insights into past exposure to mutagens, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair defects, and extent of genomic instability, which are important for understanding disease etiology, minimizing hazardous environmental exposure, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies such as immunotherapy. A number of mutation signatures have been identified based on local sequence contexts to address this need. But, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair preferences depend on both local sequence and epigenomic contexts, and it remains to be understood whether epigenomic contexts of emerging mutation signatures can provide critical, complementary etiological insights at a genome-wide scale, which are not apparent from sequence contexts alone. This is of fundamental importance, because (i) etiology of many of the emerging mutation signatures is currently unknown, (ii) DNA damage response and repair depends on tissue contexts, and defects in core DNA repair genes often result in cancer development in tissue-specific manner, and (iii) differences in the extent of DNA damage and repair between stem and differentiated cells within the same tissues have consequences for aging and disease incidence rates. Built logically on our previous works, we propose to develop computational approaches to determine the impact of epigenomic contexts on the patterns of somatic mutations within and across tissue types, and validate computational predictions using targeted experiments. In Aim-1, we will develop an epigenomic context preference map for emerging mutation signatures. In Aim-2, we will determine the basis of tissue-dependent differences in mutation profiles attributed to DNA repair defects. In Aim-3, we will predict the extent of cell lineage-dependent patterns of mutation accumulation from the mutational landscape of terminal cells. I am currently an early stage investigator, and the proposal is aligned with my long-term goal to identify fundamental principles of mutability and evolvability of somatic genomes. Our project will deliver novel resources and knowledge for addressing questions regarding genomic integrity during development and aging, and diseases such as cancer. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will use computational biology approaches to determine epigenomic context preference for somatic mutations, and use that to infer tissue-dependent changes in mutation patterns. Our results will provide fundamental insights into aspects of genome maintenance, which is important for advancing our understanding of cancer etiology, reducing exposure to mutagenic factors, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies. !",Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations,10119300,R01GM129066,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Ploidies', 'Point Mutation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'computer framework', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome integrity', 'genome-wide', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'stem', 'stem cells', 'tissue stem cells', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS -CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY,R01,2021,357750
"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome",10177978,P30DA044223,"['Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug abuse', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'brain cell', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data repository', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'digital imaging', 'drug relapse', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'graphical user interface', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenomics', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'ranpirnase', 'rat genome', 'sex', 'single cell analysis', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,P30,2021,744955
"Single cell atlas as a roadmap for interpreting human genetic variation in complex disease Project Summary Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci likely affecting human health. To translate these findings into therapeutic targets and disease treatments, we need to understand the cellular context and underlying biological mechanisms through which each disease associated variant disrupts function. Large scale, information rich datasets are being generated across multiple modalities including transcriptomics from single cell RNA-seq studies, traits and phenotypes from the UK Biobank and germline genetic variation from exome sequencing studies. Here, we propose to develop methods to integrate these amazing resources towards understanding the identifying biological and cellular mechanisms that are leading to disease. The objectives will be accomplished with the following specific aims: 1) Integrate population scale biological datasets including UK Biobank and single cell transcriptomics data to construct gene modules with the goal to recapitulate biological pathways. 2) Develop a statistical framework to measure mutational burden across each of the cell type specific gene modules. Together, this research proposal will increase the power in interpreting human genetic variation and help better understand the mechanism through which they act. These methods are being developed around an IBD dataset and will derive substantial molecular information about the mechanisms driving IBD. The lessons and methodological advances from this work will be directly applicable in many complex disease contexts. Project Narrative Genome wide association studies are highly successful identifying thousands of disease-associated loci but fall short at 1) pinpointing the biological mechanisms through which the variants effect disease and 2) capturing the effects of rare variants which may be having larger effect on disease outcomes. This research proposal details plans to integrate high-throughput single cell transcriptomics, population scale biobank datasets and exome sequencing from large disease cohorts to learn a prior on which genes are likely working together in which cell types and consequently improve the statistical power in interpreting rare human genetic variation.

"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",10101662,R01HL086694,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic approach', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,564082
"Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic management of lung disorders hallmarked by the loss-of-function of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) leading to CF are challenged by genetic and epigenetic diversity found in the CF population. Given the Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us for You (https://allofus.nih.gov/) and the large amount of genomic and phenomic diversity found in patients, it is now generally recognized that we must find new approaches to address the complexity in CF presentation in the clinic. This will require an understanding of fundamental principles dictating disease onset at birth, defined by familial genetic variation, and its progression, influenced by epigenetic programs, both unique to the individual. This proposal is about understanding the role of genetic and epigenetic diversity in CF in response to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity. We have shown these relationships to be responsive to the activity of HDACs, proteins that manage the acetylation/deacetylation balance of the genome and the proteome (the epigenome) to integrate the complex functions linking the genome to the proteome and phenome. Based on the premise that the genome and epigenome are sensitive to manipulation(s) that will favor increased functionality of the CFTR variant fold, the objective of this proposal is to mechanistically define the impact of HDAC modulation on CFTR function observed at the bench and the bedside. We hypothesize that CF can be best understood based on the rationale that disease can be defined by the collective of variation found in the CF population that alters CFTR sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual as now described using Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and the new principle of Spatial CoVariance (SCV) (Wang and Balch, 2018, In press). It is the objective of this proposal to apply VSP/SCV to analysis of the role of the epigenome in CF. Key goals to be achieved in this proposal are to 1) define molecular, cellular and physiological states that 2) describe the role of genetic/epigenetic/proteomic diversity in the CF population to 3) provide a sequence-to-function-to-structure characterization of disease in the individual. Aim 1 will explore the impact of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) to define, from a biochemical/genetic diversity perspective, how variation across the entire CF population will respond to rebalancing of acetylation/deacetylation dynamics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of HDAC7 in the management of CF genetic diversity using molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches. Aim 3 will analyze the role of select HDAC7-sensitive CFTR interactors to address their role in the management of CF variation from an epigenetic perspective. We hypothesize that the completion of these Aims will describe relationships in the population that define the epigenome-linked genome features that impact progression of CF in the individual. Our integrated genome/epigenome/proteome platform will advance our understanding of the contribution of genetic diversity in the progression and management of CF as a complex disease. Project Narrative CF is a complex loss-of-function disease caused by genetic and epigenetic variation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). We will focus on understanding spatial relationships defined by genetic diversity across the CF population that are sensitive to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity to understand the role of the acetylation/deacetylation balance in facilitating function in the individual. We will use a combination of genomic/epigenomic/proteomic approaches based on the principles of Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and Spatial CoVariance (SCV) to dissect the role of HDAC in integrated pathways that affect CFTR variant synthesis, folding, trafficking and stability/function at the cell surface that may be responsive to chemical and/or biological manipulation of the epigenome.",Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling,10134401,R01HL095524,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Cell Death', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Deacetylation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HDAC7 histone deacetylase', 'Health', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous body substance', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Role', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genomic platform', 'healthspan', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'novel strategies', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'programs', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,483750
"Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores PROJECT SUMMARY The key appeal of polygenic risk scores (PRS) is the provision of individual-level estimates of genetic liability to complex disease. These proxies of genetic liability enable a raft of applications across clinical and basic research settings. However, while PRS are set to play a pivotal role in the future of biomedical research, their present formulation is suboptimal since it fails to directly account for substructure in genetic disease risk. The overarching goal of our proposal is to introduce a new generation of pathway-specific PRS, informed by biological function. Rather a single genome-wide PRS for each individual, they will have a set of k PRS over k pathways. Pathways will be defined according to multiscale integration of ‘omics data, exploiting co-expression networks, the transcriptome and the epigenome. The key deliverable from this project will be the production of a powerful and comprehensive pathway-specific PRS computational tool, PRSet, informed by biological function. The rationale is that PRS calculated for individuals by aggregating the effects of all risk variants genome-wide, results in a loss of vital individual-level information. Providing pathway-specific estimates of genetic liability, computed in a scalable, statistically rigorous way, informed by latest multi-omic data, could enable researchers to better decompose heterogenous complex disease, identify key pathways that explain overlap or differences among disorders, and explain problems of portability of PRS between and within populations. Applying our pathway-specific PRS tool, we seek to stratify patients into more homogenous subgroups by their liability over key pathways. We will use PRSet for stratification in three ways: (i) stratifying within SCZ/BiP, testing if liability over different pathways forms multiple routes to disease, (ii) differentiating between SCZ and BiP, testing if key pathways differentiate these highly overlapping disorders, (iii) testing whether variation in treatment response can be explained by pathway liability. Such stratification could help explain past successes, failures and adverse-effects in clinical trials, and provide new therapeutic targets tailored to subsets of patients. Our proposal is significant because the burgeoning application of PRS means that any advance in the PRS approach will have immediate, high impact across psychiatric research. Pathway-specific PRS could open-up routes to hypotheses that cannot be answered by genome-wide PRS. If PRSet reveals that genetic liability is more stratified than presently modelled, then this would call for a focus on pathways and their multi-omic integration, paving a new path towards precision medicine. Our proposal is innovative because we develop the first pathway-specific, function-informed, PRS tool, we propose that disease risk may be influenced by multiple genetic liabilities, and we stratify patients according to pathway-specific genetic risk for the first time. In conclusion, our proposal delivers a tool for the field to perform powerful pathway PRS analyses, better understand genetic liability to disease, and which may offer a more direct route to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are set to play a key role in advancing our understanding of the etiology and treatment of disease. While the application of genome-wide PRS is burgeoning across biomedical research, we propose that pathway-specific PRS have even greater potential to provide etiological insights and will help pave the way to precision medicine. Here we introduce a new generation of pathway-specific polygenic risk scores, informed by biological function, and deliver a comprehensive computational tool for their analysis, applying it to perform patient stratification in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.","Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores",10136725,R01MH122866,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Route', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,635256
"Elucidating Genetic and Environmental Second Hits in Racial and Ethnic Minorities with APOL1 High-Risk Genotypes PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application by an early stage investigator who has the long-term objective of studying determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease. Risk variants in the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene on chromosome 22 are common in persons of African ancestry (African Americans and Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) and are one of the most powerful disease variants identified to date in terms of frequency and effect size. This is an important discovery for kidney disease and has furthered our understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. There are efforts underway to incorporate APOL1 genetic testing in clinical settings including in pre-transplant evaluation and targeted therapies are on the horizon. However, the presence of two risk variants (i.e. the APOL1 high-risk genotypes, seen in up to 14% of African Americans and 4% of Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) does not lead to overt kidney disease in all individuals. This incomplete penetrance indicates a major role of either genetic or environmental modifiers i.e. ‘second hits’. Although some genetic modifiers have been discovered, previous studies have been hampered by lack of sample sizes due to underrepresentation of minorities. There are also strong associations between air pollution, adverse neighborhood environment (including walkability and poverty) and podocyte toxic heavy metals (Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury) with kidney disease and racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately exposed to these environmental risk factors. We propose a robust research strategy leveraging several large datasets/cohorts to comprehensively investigate the genetic and environmental ‘second-hits’ for the APOL1- kidney disease association through the following Specific Aims: : To identify and replicate SNPs that modify the association of the APOL1 high-risk genotypes with kidney disease (Aim 1). Using genetic and clinical data on ~70,000 minority individuals (~5,400 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes), we will investigate SNPs modifying the association between APOL1 high-risk genotype and kidney disease. We will then perform replication of the top performing hits in ~25,000 independent individuals (~5,000 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). We will then assess the interaction of air pollution (particulate matter<2.5 µg or PM2.5) and adverse measures of neighborhood walkability/poverty with APOL1 high-risk for kidney disease (Aim 2) using geographically diverse studies: BioMe Biobank; Jackson Heart Study and REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) in ~40,000 individuals (~3,600 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). Finally, we will explore the interaction between urine levels of Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury with APOL1 high-risk genotypes for kidney disease in a case-control study from REGARDS (n=2,332) and in exploratory analyses assess whether soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels-an inflammatory APOL1 modifier-affects this interaction (Aim 3). This proposal will lead to critical insights on genetic and environmental ‘second hits’ for APOL1 and improved understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE. Mutations in a specific gene (Apolipoprotein L1 or APOL1) seen only in people of African ancestry (African Americans or Hispanic Americans) is linked to high rates of kidney disease, with only some of the individuals with these mutations developing kidney disease, indicating that other genetic or environmental factors are involved. We will explore these factors including other genes and common environmental exposures like air pollution/neighborhood environment, and heavy metal exposure. We will understand what additional risk factors contribute to kidney disease in individuals with this mutation, which will lead to preventative efforts to address the persistent racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease.",Elucidating Genetic and Environmental Second Hits in Racial and Ethnic Minorities with APOL1 High-Risk Genotypes,10100412,R01DK127139,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Air Pollution', 'Apolipoproteins', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadmium', 'Caribbean Hispanic', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome 22', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early treatment', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Geographic state', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metabolic', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Particulate Matter', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Preventive', 'Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Urine', 'Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'career development', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deprivation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fine particles', 'genetic association', 'genetic testing', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'minority communities', 'multidisciplinary', 'nephrotoxicity', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'podocyte', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'socioeconomics', 'targeted treatment', 'urinary', 'walkability']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,775497
"Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia Project Summary Schizophrenia (SCZ) genomics has achieved unprecedented advances. A decade ago, there was perhaps one solid finding, and there are now ~270 loci that meet consensus criteria for significance and replication. As observed for other complex psychiatric disorders, the identified regions are overwhelmingly noncoding, strongly suggesting that genetic variation in gene regulatory elements is a major mechanistic contributor. Further investigation of those regulatory mechanisms is precluded by a fundamental gap in the ability to identify, characterize, and quantify brain-relevant regulatory elements, and limited understanding of how genetic variation within those elements influences their function. To address this knowledge gap, this project will comprehensively identify, characterize, quantify, and validate noncoding functional noncoding regulatory elements and variants in neuronal cells. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that noncoding variation contributes to psychiatric disorders by directly altering the function of regulatory elements in the brain. The motivation for the proposed study is that identifying regulatory mechanisms of psychiatric disorders has the potential to translate into improved diagnosis and treatment. Powered by a team with strong interdisciplinary expertise in psychiatric disorders, functional genomics, technology development, and statistical genetics, this hypothesis will be tested by completing three specific aims: 1) Comprehensive integration of diverse data types to generate hypotheses that “connect” psychiatric genetic results to specific genes; 2) perform high-throughput CRISPR epigenome editing screens to test Aim 1 hypotheses in a natural biological context; 3) Develop mechanistic understanding and validate functional noncoding SCZ risk variants using TF binding assays and iPS-derived neurons from SCZ cases with high genetic risk scores. Our approach is innovative because it uses a highly complementary and diverse set of experimental approaches to drive targeted genetic and functional investigation into regulatory mechanisms relevant for SCZ. In doing so, the proposed research provides a much-needed path forward to understand how noncoding variation contributes to complex human phenotypes. Project Narrative / Relevance Genetic research for psychiatric disorders has achieved remarkable advances in narrowing down regions of the genome that increase risk. However, the exact mechanism for why certain individuals are at higher risk than others remains unknown. The goal of this grant is to identify, characterize, and validate functional noncoding mutations that contribute to schizophrenia. Understanding how specific DNA variants directly contribute to psychiatric disorders will be critical for developing improved diagnostics and treatment therapies.",Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia,10115982,R01MH125236,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Awareness', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organoids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Solid', 'Sweden', 'Synapses', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain volume', 'cell type', 'disorder risk', 'diverse data', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'excitatory neuron', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mind control', 'mouse model', 'nerve stem cell', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'technology development', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1653935
"Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats Project Summary (Overall)  The purpose of this renewal application is to continue the successful activities of our center, which uses quantitative genetic techniques to study the genetic basis of drug abuse-related behaviors in outbred rats. When our center was initially funded in June 2014, our goal was to develop outbred N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as a platform for genetic studies of behaviors that were difficult or impossible to study in mice. The first four years of funding have allowed us to establish a vibrant community of investigators using HS rats to study drug abuse and other traits, which we refer to as an ecosystem. This ecosystem includes both the investigators who are directly involved in this renewal application and many others who have obtained separate funding, some from NIDA, and some from other sources. The growth of this ecosystem reflects one of the ways that our center has served as national resource. We are proposing three projects that involved phenotyping HS rats for a variety of traits, including intravenous cocaine and nicotine self-administration, response to novelty, social behavior, reaction time, and delay discounting. Two of those projects are continuations from the prior funding period and are designed to increase our sample size from 1,600 to 3,200 rats per phenotype. We present data showing that such an increase produces an exponential increase in the number of significant findings. This approach parallels human genetics studies of SUD, which have also benefited tremendously from larger sample sizes. We will use these data to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a suite of related techniques. In addition, we will measure gene expression in behaviorally naïve rats using RNASeq and use those data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We will then integrate GWAS and eQTL data in an effort to identify specific genes that influence the behavioral phenotypes. Many of the behavioral domains being studied are known to be sexually dimorphic; our study will use both male and female rats, which will allow us to identify sex differences and sex by genotype interactions. We will also study genetic correlations, perform phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) and explore a novel strategy called polygenic transcriptomic risk scores (PTRS), that is intended to allow translation of polygenic signals across species. Project 4 will use a network-based approach to extend our GWAS to account for known biological networks. This proposed renewal also includes a pilot project core to support new directions and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities. Finally we propose an administrative core that supports many activities of the center, including educational, career development and public outreach. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of genes in a range of psychologically complex behaviors and will provide novel biological insights that may support future efforts at preventing or treating drug abuse. Project Narrative (Overall)  Using powerful genetic, molecular and statistical techniques, we will study the genetic basis of traits that have well-established relevance to drug abuse. We expect that these studies will enhance our understanding of drug abuse and lead to the identification of specific genes and pathways. These discoveries will improve our understanding of genetic susceptibility to drug abuse in humans and may identify new opportunities to treat psychiatric disorders including but not limited to addiction.",Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats,10160842,P50DA037844,"['Adolescent', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Breeding', 'Cancer Grant Supplements (P30)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crime', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Esthesia', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strains Rats', 'Individual', 'Intravenous', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Network-based', 'Nicotine', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Self Administration', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Reinforcement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral study', 'career development', 'cocaine self-administration', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'discounting', 'drug abuse related behavior', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'male', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'premature', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'success', 'sustained attention', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P50,2021,3009655
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,10213030,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Arginine', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biogenesis', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Carbohydrates', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Health Professional', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Pathway', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Optic Nerve', 'Ornithine', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plasma', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'case control', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'dietary restriction', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'time interval', 'trait']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,530499
"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT. Project Narrative Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. The short-term goal of this study is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in college-aged young adults. The relevance of the project to public health is reflected in the long-term goal, which is to construct a genetic risk profile which can be used by health-care providers and educators to identify individuals genetically at risk for chronic tinnitus.",Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,10359459,R21DC016704,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Audiology', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Professional', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Hyperacusis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industrial Arts', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Music', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Otitis Media', 'PTGS1 gene', 'PTGS2 gene', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Sodium', 'Source', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Tinnitus', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinical development', 'college', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hearing impairment', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'relating to nervous system', 'serotonin receptor', 'serotonin transporter', 'sound', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'voltage gated channel', 'young adult']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2021,135331
"Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to establish a quantitative framework for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) care based on clinical, imaging, genetic, and informatics principles. In the previous grant period, we have developed artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis, but real-world adoption has been limited by lack of prospective validation and by perception of these systems as “black boxes” that do not explain their rationale for diagnosis. Furthermore, although biomedical research data are being generated at an enormous pace, much less work has been done to integrate disparate scientific findings across the spectrum from genomics to imaging to clinical medicine. This renewal will address current gaps in knowledge in these areas. Our overall hypotheses are that developing a quantitative framework for ROP care using artificial intelligence and analytics will improve clinical disease management, that building “explainable” artificial intelligence systems will enhance clinical acceptance and educational opportunities, and that analysis of relationships among clinical, imaging, environmental, and genetic findings, in ROP will improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and risk. These hypotheses will be tested using three Specific Aims: (1) Evaluation performance of an artificial intelligence system for ROP diagnosis and screening prospectively. This will include: (a) recruit a target of over 2000 eye exams including wide-angle retinal images from 375 subjects at 5 centers, (b) optimize an image quality detection algorithm we have recently developed, and (c) analyze system accuracy for ROP diagnosis and screening (using a novel quantitative vascular severity scale). (2) Improve the interpretability of our existing artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis. This will include: (a) increase “explainability” of systems by combining deep learning with traditional feature extraction methods, (b) develop neural networks to identify changes between serial images, and (c) evaluate these methods through systematic feedback by experts. (3) Develop integrated models for ROP pathogenesis and risk. This will include: (a) build and improve ROP risk prediction models based on clinical, image, and demographic features, and (b) integrate genetic, imaging, clinical, and environmental variables through genetic risk prediction by machine learning, by investigating casual relationships with genetic variants and genetic risk scores, and by incorporating SNP associations with gene expression measurements to identify functional genes of ROP. Ultimately, these studies will significantly reduce barriers to adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence for clinicians, and will demonstrate a prototype for health information management which combines genotypic and phenotypic data. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have worked successfully together for nearly 10 years, and who have expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, computational biology, ophthalmic genetics, genetic analysis, and statistical genetics. Project Narrative ROP is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the US and throughout the world, and the number of infants at risk for disease is increasing as the rate of premature birth rises. Rapidly-progressive changes associated with retinal vascular development may be visualized by clinical examination, captured by wide-angle imaging, and analyzed genetically. This project will develop, enhance, and validate artificial intelligence and analytic tools to help clinicians identify infants at risk for severe ROP using image analysis, genetic analysis, and integrative informatics that combines these factors – while also providing insight about disease pathogenesis.",Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity,10206145,R01HD107493,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Measurement', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Other Genetics', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Publishing', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'diagnosis standard', 'disorder risk', 'feature extraction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neovascular', 'neural network', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'real world application', 'recruit', 'retinal imaging', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'supplemental oxygen']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,640901
"Deep learning for decoding genetic regulation and cellular maps in craniofacial development Project Summary A deep understanding of gene regulation and function during craniofacial development is not only important for our biological knowledge, but also critical to identify causal variants and genes underlying many dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases. Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and DOC diseases. These datasets are highly heterogeneous (e.g. platforms, species, tissues, developmental stages) and cross-species (e.g. human and mouse), requiring novel analytical approaches for decoding genetic regulation, molecular function, and cellular maps in craniofacial development. Critically, because of practical unavailability of human embryonic craniofacial tissue, there is a big gap between the abundant -omics and functional studies in murine craniofacial development and large-scale human genetic studies of DOC diseases. In this proposal, we combine machine learning, genomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), complex disease genetics, developmental biology to design novel methods aiming to decode complex genetic regulation and cellular maps during craniofacial development. We propose three specific aims. Aim 1. To develop a deep learning method, DeepFace, for characterizing and prioritizing genetic variants and regulation during craniofacial development. DeepFace is designed to decipher functional impact of noncoding variants and will be the first deep learning method to integrate cross-species functional features in craniofacial development. We will validate DeepFace by using data from genome-wide association studies (15 datasets) and case-parent trio-based whole genome sequencing (3 datasets) of orofacial clefts (OFCs). This validation will identify potential causal variants, both common and de novo mutations, in OFCs. Aim 2. To develop deep learning methods for time-series scRNA-seq data analysis in craniofacial development. We will develop novel algorithms including TTNNet for integrating time-series scRNA- seq data and DrivAER for tracing developmental trajectories and identifying driving transcription factors in craniofacial development. We will validate the methods using scRNA-seq datasets from the FaceBase consortium and to-be-generated data for mouse palate formation. Aim 3. To experimentally validate and characterize the top ranked novel mutations (Aim 1) and regulators (Aim 2). Building on our previous studies, strong preliminary data and highly experienced team, this proposal is timely to develop machine learning methods to effectively address the current gap between the genomics studies in murine craniofacial development and human genetic studies of orofacial clefts. The successful completion will provide 1) the NIDCR research community a suite of novel methods and analytical tools for genomic/epigenomic/scRNA-seq data, and 2) the mechanistic assessment on the mutations/genes and transcriptional regulators that are potentially involved in OFCs and related craniofacial diseases. Project Narrative Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases; however, these data are highly heterogeneous, limiting the analysis for the understanding of DOC biology and discovery of causal mutations and regulators in DOC diseases. In this proposal, we will develop novel deep learning approaches to decode complex genetic regulation and cellular maps during craniofacial development and apply the methods to orofacial cleft genetic data.",Deep learning for decoding genetic regulation and cellular maps in craniofacial development,10235696,R01DE030122,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'FaceBase', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oral', 'Palate', 'Parents', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'cleft lip and palate', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'craniofacial tissue', 'data integration', 'de novo mutation', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'genomic tools', 'heterogenous data', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'orofacial cleft', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,585184
"Integrative approaches to identification and interpretation of genes underlying psychiatric disorders Psychiatric disorders contribute substantially to the disease burden in the United States and worldwide. There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to many psychiatric illnesses. In recent years, with the advancement of high throughput genomic technologies and the availability of large samples, remarkable success has been made in risk gene discovery for major psychiatric disorders [e.g., schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)] through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, due to the high complexity of the human genome, few causal genes or variants have been identified within GWAS risk loci, thus, to date, limiting the potential of translating these genetic findings into biological mechanisms. There is now a great need to pinpoint causal genes/variants at the known GWAS risk loci and to understand their causal mechanisms, as well as to discover novel genes from novel risk loci. There is also growing evidence that risk variants from GWAS tend to be located in regulatory DNA regions in disease-relevant tissues or cell types, suggesting that risk variants may act through regulation of gene expression. Studies leveraging diverse functional genomic resources may benefit psychiatric risk gene discovery and result in better prediction of their biological relevance. This proposal aims to employ highly integrative approaches to identify causal genes and regulatory noncoding variants underlying SCZ, BD, and MDD. Our specific aims are: 1) Integrate GWAS with brain methylome for risk gene discovery, by leveraging a dense high-resolution reference panel of DNAm from whole genome bisulfite sequencing of DNA from three different brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and caudate) and an enlarged array-based reference panel; 2) Apply a deep learning approach to predicting disease-relevant regulatory variants, by employing features from disease-relevant gene regulatory networks and functional genomic annotations within brain tissues and neural cell types; and 3) Map prioritized genes and variants to specific brain cell types and brain function. We have assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary team with expertise in psychiatric genetics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and neuroimaging. Our goal is to apply multidisciplinary and cutting-edge analytical strategies to help address the challenges arising in the post-GWAS era. The identification and characterization of risk genes and noncoding regulatory variants would help improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie psychiatric illnesses, moving us closer to designing effective prevention and treatment for these disorders.

"Glaucoma Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning Integration of Image-Based Phenotypes and Genetic Associations PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This proposal describes a 5-year training program to develop an academic career focused on improving glaucoma risk prediction through a combination of genomic and phenotypic risk. I will use supervised, semi- supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to define novel structural and longitudinal image based endophenotypes for POAG aligned with disease subtype and progression. These endophenotypes will be used to discover new disease associated genomic loci. By including longitudinal data, we aim to identify genetic markers for progressive disease. We will use known POAG risk variants and novel genetic variants identified in these analyses to create several candidate genome wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) for POAG. Each candidate PRS with and without addition of demographic and image features will be tested for its utility to predict glaucoma risk is independent NEIGHBORHOOD and LIFE cohorts. We hypothesize that a PRS based on genetic variants associated with our endophenotypes will have improved POAG case predictive power compared to PRS based on cross-sectional genome wide association studies. The proposed studies have the potential to provide insight into disease pathogenesis and improve predictive power of genetic testing  I am well positioned to conduct this research and undertake the training proposed here. I have a strong quantitative science background with a degree in engineering, statistical training and established track records of large database research. Additionally, I have proposed a detailed career development plan that will allow me to 1) learn the fundamentals, applications and limitations of machine learning based approaches for automated fundus image analysis and 2) understand computational biology and statistical approaches to handle large genomics datasets. My training plan includes an MPH in quantitative methods at the HSPH with concentration in computational biology and statistical learning. Additionally, I am supported by a multidisciplinary team of committed mentors dedicated to my academic growth and progression into an independent clinician scientist. I will work with glaucoma genetics experts, Drs Wiggs and Segre, and leaders in statistical and machine learning, Drs Elze and Kalpathy-Cramer. I will have full access to the extensive resources at MEE, Partners Healthcare and the Harvard system for this work and my career development.  The research outlined here will improve our understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and lay the foundation for development of multimodal precision medicine approaches for glaucoma screening and diagnosis. This research is cutting edge and prepares me well for my career as an independent NIH funded investigator with the aim to use longitudinal multi-modal clinical, imaging, testing and multi-omics data in multi- ethnic glaucoma patients to 1) understand pathways of vision loss, 2) develop precision medicine approaches to pre-symptomatically identify patients at high risk of functional vision loss and progression and 3) make these technologies a clinical reality in order to reduce the burden of unnecessary blindness. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is a progressive, irreversible optic neuropathy with variable presentation and clinical course and we currently lack the ability to pre-symptomatically distinguish patients at risk of severe and progressive disease from those individuals unlikely to develop glaucoma-related vision loss. Using existing data from two large biobanks, this project will use cutting edge machine learning approaches to define POAG phenotypes aligned with disease subtype and progression, use these to discover novel disease related genetic associations, and test their utility for identifying glaucoma cases in independent cohorts. Ultimately, we aim to develop a precision medicine approach using imaging and genetic features to improve our assessment of disease risk for any individual.",Glaucoma Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning Integration of Image-Based Phenotypes and Genetic Associations,10191922,K23EY032634,"['Address', 'Attention', 'Blindness', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Accounting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multiomic Data', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Progressive Disease', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'functional loss', 'fundus imaging', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'high intraocular pressure', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'macula', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistical learning', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,K23,2021,263101
"Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed research is to discover neurobiologically interpretable gene networks for addiction, specifically for cigarettes and opioids. To achieve this goal, we will apply a new multi-omics, multi-method framework—Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetII)—to identify gene networks associated uniquely with cigarette or opioid outcomes and networks shared across these addictions. GNetII includes genome-wide epistasis, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, gene network construction, and Lines-of-Evidence methods. These cornerstone methods will enable integration of large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in living subjects, postmortem human brain data (RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and variant genotypes) from addiction case and control decedents (deceased individuals), and public omics data. Cigarette smoking and opioid outcomes are genetically correlated, and we have parallel GWAS and multi-omics brain data available in two highly relevant tissues, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, for both of these addictions. Cigarettes and opioids are leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. These addictions affect millions of U.S. adults and youths and are highly heritable (e.g., 54% and 71% for opioid addiction and nicotine dependence, respectively). GWAS analyses have identified 300+ loci at genome-wide significance for smoking. GWAS for opioids are farther behind in sample size, but genome-wide significant loci are emerging. Neurobiological effects of known loci are largely unknown, and more loci and connections among the loci are still to be discovered. We hypothesize that applying new big data science methods to large-scale GWAS and gene regulation data in brain tissue will reveal previously undetected relationships (such as epistatic interactions between genes) and add knowledge of the neurobiology underlying addiction. We propose the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Integrate multi-omics data to discover cigarette-associated gene networks.  Aim 2: Integrate multi-omics data to discover opioid-associated gene networks.  Aim 3: Integrate multi-omics data to find general addiction-associated gene networks. For cigarettes, Aims 1 and 3 will leverage GWAS (N=528,259) and multi-omics data in postmortem human brain from active smoker and nonsmoker decedents (N=262). For opioids, Aims 2 and 3 will use GWAS (N=49,178) and multi-omics brain data from opioid overdose case and control decedents (N=147). Analyses will be performed on Summit, the world's fastest supercomputer, which will greatly improve the likelihood of neurobiologically meaningful discoveries. Our study will capture complex networks across the genome to find previously unknown genes, as well as help explain the neurobiological underpinnings for the growing number of genetic loci associated with cigarette or opioid outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Addictions to cigarettes and opioids are public health epidemics. The goal of this study is to identify gene networks that predispose individuals to these addictions. We will leverage cutting-edge methods (such as Explainable Artificial Intelligence), large-scale genome-wide association data in living subjects, and multiple omics data in postmortem human brain to further our understanding of the neurobiology underlying addiction.",Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids.,10267762,R01DA051913,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cigarette', 'Complex', 'Cotinine', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Epidemic', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Oranges', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'base', 'big-data science', 'brain tissue', 'case control', 'cigarette addiction', 'cigarette smoking', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'non-smoker', 'novel', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'random forest', 'smoking addiction', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'young adult']",NIDA,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2021,588225
"Adapting machine learning methods to detect genetic loci specific to strictly defined MDD Abstract  This project seeks to further our understanding of the genetic influences on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). One approach to increasing sample sizes for molecular genetic studies of MDD and thereby increasing power to detect genetic loci is to assess individuals using surveys that are shorter and more efficient than full clinical assessments. This `minimal phenotyping' leads to identification of risk loci that may not be specific to strictly defined MDD and can be associated with a variety of psychiatric phenotypes. While these discoveries are important to understand the overall biology of complex mental and psychiatric outcomes, they offer little direct and actionable insight into the biological underpinning of strictly defined MDD which shows increased severity, impairment, and recurrence risk and accounts for a disproportionate impact on disability and morbidity in comparison to liberally defined MDD. Recently, large biobanks surveying tens to hundreds of thousands of subjects across hundreds to thousands of variables and EHR records have been become available to the scientific community. Combining rich phenotype data with genome-wide genotyping or sequencing offers an unprecedented opportunity to leverage these resources to advance discovery and understanding of the genetic influences on MDD. One major challenge is the lack of uniform measures that allow assessment of strictly defined MDD, impairment, severity, and recurrence risk. This lack of `deep phenotyping' while pragmatic in allowing the assembly of large samples, creates challenges in accurate determinations of controls, non-specific mild cases, and strictly defined cases. We have previously shown how machine learning (ML) analysis methods can leverage this type of heterogeneous, broad, but light collection of information to predict and quantify risk in subjects not deeply assessed. While there is significant room for improvement in these predictions, the resulting effective sample size and power to detect specific liability loci increased dramatically when this method was applied. In Aim 1, we plan to evaluate 2 families of ML methods that can be used to predict unmeasured and specific strictly defined MDD risk. In Aim 2, we propose to use these predictions of risk in genetic association analyses to detect common genetic variation that influences risk specific to strictly defined MDD. Finally, we will make our biobank adapted ML method pipeline available to the broader psychiatric genetics research community which is expected to improve power and loci detection for other psychiatric disorders.   NARRATIVE  Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is common psychiatric disorder, a leading cause of disability worldwide, and partially influenced by genetics. Rigorous clinical assessments are generally needed for studies to distinguish between genetic loci influencing mild versus debilitating manifestations of the disorder. We propose to evaluate and adapt machine learning methods to estimate risk to strictly defined MDD in large-scale biobanks samples that measure many variables but may not contain rigorous clinical assessments and use these predictions to discover additional genetic variation specifically influencing MDD.",Adapting machine learning methods to detect genetic loci specific to strictly defined MDD,10196078,R21MH126358,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'biobank', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'lifetime risk', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'psychogenetics', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'statistical and machine learning', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'trait', 'vector']",NIMH,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R21,2021,208389
"Deep Learning Based Genetic Risk Prediction for Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type I diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease of childhood caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In a subset of individuals with a genetic predisposition to T1D, environmental triggers instigate an autoimmune response which targets and damages pancreatic islets, leading to pre-diabetes and ultimately diabetes. A critical barrier in T1D prevention research is to identify and directly enroll children with a strong genetic predisposition for developing T1D into prevention trials. A robust genetic risk score (GRS) would allow for the identification of children at high-risk of T1D, their recruitment into T1D prevention trials, and subsequent testing of novel interventions. I aim to 1) optimize a multi-layer feedforward neural network genetic risk predictor that can be used to enroll newborns directly into T1D prevention trials; and 2) identify putative, novel T1D-causing SNPs, and their interactions. Completion of aim 1 would provide a better GRS to the T1D research community, which can be used to identify children with higher genetic risk of T1D development, increasing the statistical power of future T1D prevention clinical trials. Completion of aim 2 will provide a deeper biological understanding of the molecular drivers of T1D development, and potential new therapeutic targets for T1D prevention trials. Successful completion of this project will both help understand the genetic causes of type 1 diabetes and help prevent the disease.

"Advancing Multi-Omics and Electronic Health Records Computational Methodologies PROJECT SUMMARY  Phenomic advances from large-scale electronic health records (EHR) linked to DNA biobanks have pioneered an efficient approach to genetic discovery that has transformed human genetic studies, with the enormous potential to provide constraints on relevant biological mechanisms on a wide spectrum of human phenotypes. Nevertheless, our understanding of the downstream molecular consequences of genetic associations remains limited and impedes our ability to develop novel therapeutic strategies for complex diseases. Given their enormous discovery potential for human genomics and precision medicine, genetic analyses in diverse populations offer unprecedented opportunities to identify causal genetic mechanisms underlying human trait variation.  This research proposal aims to address these convergent developments and critical gaps and to exert a powerful influence on efforts to expand our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Here we hypothesize that a comprehensive multi- omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology will provide a robust and rigorous framework. This proposal thus has the following aims: AIM 1: Develop a regularized regression based methodology and a deep learning framework to improve characterization of the genetic architecture of gene expression and to build robust prediction models, extending a Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methodology (called PrediXcan) that we developed. AIM 2: Develop statistical causal modeling of trait-associated genetic variation through a convergent TWAS and Mendelian Randomization approach and apply it to thousands of human traits with available GWAS and EHR data. AIM 3: Develop analytic approaches and software tools to further genetic analyses in admixed and multi-ethnic populations and to lay the groundwork for trans-ethnic multi-omic methodologies, using EHR data (e.g., BioVU, UK Biobank, All of Us).

"Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS) PROJECT SUMMARY Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects up to 5% of couples, yet nearly half of cases remain unexplained by current testing recommendations. Euploid pregnancy loss, in the setting of unexplained RPL, is particularly frustrating for patients and providers because there is no clear explanation or any proven therapies to mitigate risk of subsequent miscarriages. As clinical presentation and subsequent pregnancy outcomes vary widely, this complex disorder will ultimately require a precision health approach. While more than 3000 human genes are conserved and likely essential for early development, remarkably little is known about their contribution to RPL and current genetic databases are essentially devoid of RPL entries. Moreover, there is currently no database that annotates phenotypes and genotypes of these essential genes. This proposal aims to define genetic determinants of RPL through clinical and molecular phenotyping and genomic sequencing of a large RPL cohort, combined with novel bioinformatics and machine learning approaches to derive predictive risk algorithms. A comprehensive approach to identify genomic markers of pregnancy loss by whole genome sequencing of well- characterized RPL trios (mother-father-pregnancy loss) will be undertaken in Aim 1. These genetics efforts will be paired in Aim 2 with metabolomic, lipidomic and single cell transcriptomic profiling preconception and in early pregnancy. Leveraged with innovative machine learning strategies in Aim 3, this approach will significantly advance understanding of the genetic underpinnings of unexplained RPL. A clinical ‘intolerome’ database will be constructed in Aim 4 to facilitate worldwide collaboration and curation of genotypes and associated phenotypes, making the genetics and omics data and results available to the public as well as other funded teams. This multidisciplinary team includes leaders in RPL, genetics, genomics, prenatal diagnosis, bioinformatics and machine learning at Stanford, UCSF and OHSU. Combined we have a substantial cohort of RPL patients that will serve as a robust recruitment source, along with a collaboration with the unique UK Pregnancy Baby BioBank of existing trios to accomplish project goals. The proposed study is anticipated to have significant clinical and research impact by identifying the genomic contribution to RPL in a large and well phenotyped cohort and building improved risk predictions based on machine learning incorporating clinical, genetic, and molecular data. This work will lay the foundation for precision medicine-based interventions for RPL couples who are difficult to diagnose and have few proven treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that there are very few proven treatments for unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss, uncovering genetic mechanisms is crucial for identifying individuals at risk and initiating targeted, patient-centered treatments. The proposed work will provide unprecedented machine learning analysis to define the spectrum of genomic and clinical indicators for recurrent pregnancy loss, unparalleled molecular phenotyping through metabolomics and single cell RNA sequencing, and development of a publicly-available “intolerome” database which will provide the foundation for a future prenatal OMIM.",Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS),10225966,R01HD105256,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Etiology', 'Fathers', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hematology', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Multiomic Data', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy loss', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data repository', 'early pregnancy', 'epidemiology study', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lipidomics', 'metabolomics', 'molecular marker', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment center', 'whole genome']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1465292
"Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living donor evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Living donor (LD) kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, LDs take on a higher risk of future ESKD themselves. African American (AA) LDs have an even greater, 3.3-fold, risk of ESKD than white LDs post-donation. Because evidence suggests that Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants contribute to this greater risk, transplant nephrologists are increasingly using APOL1 testing to evaluate LD candidates of African ancestry. However, nephrologists do not consistently perform genetic counseling with LD candidates about APOL1 due to a lack of knowledge and skill in counseling about APOL1. Without proper counseling, APOL1 testing will magnify LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, jeopardizing their informed consent. Given their elevated risk of ESRD post-donation, and AAs’ widely-held cultural concerns about genetic testing, it is ethically critical to protect AA LD candidates’ safety through APOL1 testing in a culturally competent manner to improve informed decisions about donating.  No transplant programs have integrated APOL1 testing into LD evaluation in a culturally competent manner. Clinical “chatbots,” mobile apps that use artificial intelligence to provide genetic information to patients and relieve constraints on clinicians’ time, can improve informed treatment decisions and reduce decisional conflict. The chatbot “Gia,” created by a medical genetics company, can be adapted to any condition. However, no chatbot on APOL1 is currently available. No counseling training programs are available for nephrologists to counsel AA LDs about APOL1 and donation in a culturally competent manner. Given the shortage of genetic counselors, increasing nephrologists’ genetic literacy is critical to integrating genetic testing into practice.  The objective of this study is to culturally adapt and evaluate the effectiveness of an APOL1 testing program for AA LDs at two transplant centers serving large AA LD populations (Chicago, IL, and Washington, DC). The APOL1 testing program will evaluate the effect of the culturally competent testing, chatbot, and counseling on AA LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, preparedness for decision-making, willingness to donate, and satisfaction with informed consent. The specific aims are to: 1. Adapt Gia and transplant counseling to APOL1 for use in routine clinical practice 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on decisional conflict, preparedness, and willingness to  donate in a pre-post design 3. Evaluate the implementation of this intervention into clinical practice by using the RE-AIM framework to  longitudinally evaluate nephrologist counseling practices and LDs’ satisfaction with informed consent.  The impact of this study will be the creation of a model for APOL1 testing of AA LDs, which can then be implemented nationally via implementation science approaches. APOL1 will serve as a model for integrating culturally competent genetic testing into transplant and other practices to improve patient informed consent. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants may contribute to African American living kidney donors’ even greater (3.3-fold) risk of end-stage renal disease post-donation than white living kidney donors. However, transplant physicians do not consistently use APOL1 genetic testing or counsel African American living donor candidates about APOL1, which may undermine candidates’ ability to give informed consent about donating and exacerbate health disparities in living donation and transplantation. By evaluating the effectiveness of a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program, the proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly scale up APOL1 testing nationally as a novel and ethical approach to protect African American living donors’ safety and enhance their informed consent.",Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living donor evaluation,10180256,R01DK128207,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'African', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Altruism', 'Apolipoproteins', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioethics', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Informed Consent', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Living Donors', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of life', 'Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance', 'Readiness', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'chatbot', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'genetic counselor', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'implementation intervention', 'implementation outcomes', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'literacy', 'living kidney donor', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'satisfaction', 'scale up', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'success', 'transplant centers', 'willingness']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,714612
