"Neural Mechanisms of Social Communication in Parrots PROJECT SUMMARY When Confucius said, “Tell me who are your friends, and I’ll tell you who you are,” he was noticing that how we behave and communicate is shaped by who we choose to hang out with every day. We constantly mimic the mannerisms and behaviors of friends and loved ones. Yet the neural basis of how we imitate, and more importantly who we choose to emulate and why, is largely unknown. Parrots provide a powerful yet untapped model system for social learning. Parrots, like humans and non-human primates, live in a specific type of ‘fission- fusion’ social network in which making and maintaining friendships is the key to fitness. Like humans, they selectively imitate and learn the names of their carefully selected companions. Here we aim to launch parrots as a new animal model in systems neuroscience. In aims 1, we will record neural activity in the vocal motor cortical output of the song system (nucleus AAC) in pairs of budgerigars engaged in courtship interactions. In these first- ever neural recordings form awake, behaving parrots, we are finding that AAC neurons exhibit premotor signals for vocalizations (as expected) and for expressive gestures such as silent kissing, head-bobbing and allogrooming. This joint vocal and gestural neural control, observed in human Broca’s area but not in songbirds – means that what was thought to be a songbird-like ‘song system’ is actually a more general system for social interaction. We next test the causal relationship between song system activity and social behavior. Inactivating AAC during courtship interactions will test if/how vocalizations and gestures degrade or lose their coordination (Aim 2.1). Inactivating frontal or posterior cortical inputs to AAC in bonded pairs will test the songbird-inspired idea that variability and order depend on distinct cortical pathways (Aim 2.2). For each inactivation experiment, a pair of interacting birds is conceptualized as a single dynamical system – and we will use machine learning guided behavioral analysis to quantify how vocalizations and gestures change (or do not) in both the inactivated and non-inactivated partner. Finally, in Aim 3 we will image dopamine (DA) release using fiber photometry and genetically encoded DA sensors. Pilot data demonstrate feasibility of DA imaging in singing birds. These experiments will test for the first time if DA signals, known to evaluate the quality of reward outcomes, similarly evaluate social outcomes. Courtship dynamics are perfect because gestural ‘requests’ to allogroom or ‘kiss’ are rejected or accepted with visually and acoustically obvious ‘consent’ or ‘deny’ signals. Males make hundreds of advances per day and use female feedback to learn – providing natural trial structure, within-session learning, and ‘events’ to which we can align simultaneously recorded male and female DA signals – which may or may not come into alignment as a pair ‘decides’ to bond or not. Budgerigar interactions resemble human conversations – a back-and-forth of vocalizations and gestures that both communicate agonistic or affiliative signals and control vocal learning and partner selection. Together, these experiments will help establish parrots as a new model system in social neuroscience and will ready us for a follow-up R01 submission in two years. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Humans thrive or suffer on the basis of social acceptance and rejection, but little is known about what goes on in the brain during high-stakes social interactions. Here, we will perform the first-ever neural recordings from socializing parrots to test how vocalizations and communicative gestures are coordinated during courtship and how the outcomes of romantic advances are encoded in the dopamine system.",Neural Mechanisms of Social Communication in Parrots,10207958,R34NS121898,"['Accelerometer', 'Acoustics', 'Active Learning', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Back', 'Beak', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Broca&apos', 's area', 'Cannulas', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Consent', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Courtship', 'Data', 'Dopamine', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Friends', 'Friendships', 'Generations', 'Gestures', 'Grooming', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Melopsittacus', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Names', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pair Bond', 'Parakeets', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photometry', 'Primates', 'Psittacidae', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publications', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Socialization', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'awake', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'court', 'dopamine system', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'loved ones', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microphone', 'motor control', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'outcome prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'social', 'social communication', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'sound', 'stereotypy', 'vocal control', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NINDS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R34,2021,689222
"Neural Encoding of Social Information PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Vocal communication plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of social interactions and is impaired in a wide range of neurological disorders. Consequently, a major component of translational research focuses on identifying circuit-level neurobiological mechanisms underlying social communication deficits. Determining the neural mechanisms underlying social communication deficits requires both understanding the functions of neural circuits as well as the ability to link neural circuits to specific naturalistic behaviors. However, obtaining this information has been challenging because of the difficulties in interpreting complex behavioral interactions in freely socializing animals. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the neural circuitry controlling naturalistic social behaviors directly influenced by communication. This could ultimately allow communication disorders to be treated by therapeutically targeting atypically functioning neural circuitry. In pursuit of this goal, the overall objective in this proposal is to determine how social communication is encoded in the nervous system and the role it plays in shaping behavior. The proposal uses a novel microphone array system to track the vocal behavior of freely socializing, individual adult mice—a technique that has eluded the field for 50 years. Coupling this innovative method with in vivo wireless electrophysiology and machine-learning techniques used for robustly extracting meaningful social information will enable identification of the neural circuits that encode social communication and the role communication plays in directly shaping social behavior. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mice emit behavior-dependent vocalizations that directly alter the social dynamics between animals. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that behaviorally-dependent vocalizations are encoded in the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the lateral entorhinal cortex, one of the primary cortical inputs to CA2, encodes the locations of vocalizations in egocentric reference frames. The proposed research will have a broad impact as these studies will provide fundamental insight into the neurobiological basis of social communication. Moreover, these experiments will lay the groundwork for future studies examining the neural basis of social communication in mouse models of neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and autism spectrum disorders. Project Narrative:  Understanding the fundamental principles governing social communication is of paramount importance as deficits in expressive and receptive vocal communication skills are hallmark characteristics of a wide range of neurological disorders. The proposed experiments aim to determine the direct impact of social communication on behavior and delineate how neural circuits encode social communication. Ultimately, knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential to inform and hasten the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches that will help reduce the burdens of human disability.",Neural Encoding of Social Information,10183334,R01MH122752,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Agonistic Behavior', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Characteristics', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Pheromone', 'Play', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translational Research', 'Wireless Technology', 'affiliative behavior', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'free behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mature animal', 'microphone', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'sound', 'source localization', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2021,618061
"ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES Specific Aims: Anxiety and depressive disorders are common, comorbid, and challenging to treat, ranking them among the greatest contributors to human suffering. An early-life extreme inhibited or anxious temperament, characterized by behavioral inhibition and extreme physiological responses to novel and/or potentially threatening contexts, is among the strongest predictors of the later development of anxiety and depressive disorders. Understanding the neurobiology of this early-life risk will identify treatment targets and provide a unique opportunity to develop scientifically founded behavioral and pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent stress-related psychopathology. Here, we propose a prospective longitudinal study in nonhuman primates (NHPs) to understand how inborn risk-factors and early-life inhibition lead to anxiety and maladaptive social behavior during adolescence and early adulthood. We will do this by leveraging the resources at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), including previous early-life assessments of behavioral inhibition, a multi-generational family pedigree, and large outdoor housing, alongside cutting-edge tools and analysis techniques, including multimodal neuroimaging and neural network-based animal tracking and behavioral analyses. We will use a prospective longitudinal design, and select 176 NHPs (88 F) previously phenotyped for early-life inhibition (3-4 months old) from the CNPRC’s large, multi-generational family pedigree. To study the emergence of anxiety- and depression-like symptomatology, half of the NHPs will be ""adolescents"" and half will be ""young adults"". We will perform in-lab behavioral and neuroimaging assessments, and longitudinal large-scale monitoring as animals navigate the entirety of their socio-geographic environment. First, we will examine how heritable-risk and early- life inhibition contribute to maladaptive socio-emotional behaviors in ecologically-valid contexts during adolescence and early adulthood (Aim 1). Starting in puberty, the risk for anxiety disorders is greater for girls than boys. Therefore, we also aim to demonstrate adolescent and young-adult sex differences in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 2). To understand how these factors are mediated by alterations in relevant brain circuitry, including the extended amygdala, each animal will undergo multimodal structural and functional neuroimaging assessments. Using these data, we will test specific hypotheses regarding the extent to which extended amygdala circuits link early-life inhibition to the progression of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 3). This combination of approaches promises to provide unprecedented insight into the neural substrates of maladaptive socio-emotional behavior during the transition to adulthood. PROJECT NARRATIVE A key challenge for psychiatry and clinical psychology is to discover, understand, and ultimately treat the root causes of the most common mental illness, including anxiety and depressive disorders. This project will harness an innovative combination of longitudinal measures and state-of-the-art tools—including a multi-generational pedigree, brain imaging, and deep neural networks—to objectively identify and prioritize the pathways that contribute to maladaptive social behavior as individuals mature into adults. This proposal promises to identify new treatment targets for the prevention of stress-related psychopathology.",ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES,10256803,R01MH121735,"['5 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brothers', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Heritability', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Behavior', 'Inherited', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Primates', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Puberty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxiety-like behavior', 'anxious temperament', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'biobehavior', 'boys', 'brain circuitry', 'child depression', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'depressive symptoms', 'emerging adult', 'emotional behavior', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'genetic pedigree', 'girls', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'mature animal', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'preadolescence', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,743109
"Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors.  One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction. We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased machine-learning behavioral assessments.  We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; 2) characterize long-term synaptic plasticity of the vHIP-mPFC projection in Mecp2 KO mice; and 3) determine if chemogenetic modulation of the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons alters mPFC function and social behaviors.  These studies will provide fundamental information on the functional and structural properties of the long- range connection between the vHIP and mPFC in the developing brain. The impact of this work extends beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,10087555,R01MH118563,"['Affect', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Contralateral', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Label', 'Link', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Membrane', 'Memory impairment', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'cellular targeting', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive task', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'experimental study', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'postnatal development', 'response', 'social', 'social deficits', 'spatial memory', 'voltage sensitive dye']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,393603
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control.

"Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data Abstract Poor cancers, lengthy, achieve diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors, the most prevalent risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and can be treated to prevent disease. However, most diet, PA, and weight loss interventions are costly, and burdensome. Theseinterventions could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people a sustainable pattern of health behavior change so that treatment could be tapered and then stopped without behavioral relapse. Theories of habit formation might be assumed to address this problem, but they have not proved actionable to guide treatment decisions because they do not specify measurable criteria to reliably detect acquisition of a durable behavior pattern. Hence, we propose to identify behavior patterns that precede and predict maintenance of target-level behavioral improvement that persist after an intervention ends. The measurements needed to tell whether an intervention has durably entrained behavioral improvement are collected as part of diet, PA, and weight loss interventions. Specifically, participants continuously self-monitor their behavior digitally while assessments are relayed back to inform them about progress toward goals. We will analyze self-monitoring measures collected in 6 mHealth trials, conducted over 14 years among over 1,600 participants and more than 147,000 daily observations, to assess when an intervention has durably entrained targeted behaviors, as validated by their reliable persistence post- intervention. We will use location scale modeling to quantify change not only in the absolute level (location) of a behavior but also in its within-person variability (scale). We posit that the induction of durable behavior change requires both improvement in location (increases for healthy behaviors; decreases for unhealthy ones) and decrease in scale (i.e., increased behavioral consistency). Aim 1 will apply existing location scale methods to test the hypothesis that effective interventions will improve the location and reduce the scale of targeted behaviors across all trials. Because existing methods only measure scale at the group level and cannot measure the change in an individual's behavioral consistency that we need to personalize treatment adaptation, Aim 2 will extend location scale methods to enable individual estimation of the rate of change in behavioral consistency. Estimates derived from the new method will be analyzed to learn which parameters of behavior change during intervention are most associated with maintenance post-treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will apply machine learning to estimates from the extended location-scale mixed models to establish ranges and behavioral patterns that predict behavioral maintenance post-treatment. These resultswill inform behaviorinterventionscience and improve treatment efficiency by guiding real-timedecisions about the needed dosage and duration of behavioral treatments. Project Narrative Health promotion could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people have established a durable behavioral change so that their treatment could be tapered with low risk of relapse. The project introduces a new method of quantifying improvement in both the absolute level and the day-to-day consistency of targeted behaviors to learn when healthy changes are likely to persist.",Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data,10218158,R01DK125414,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Promotion Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Theory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vegetables', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cancer risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'control theory', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'digital', 'dosage', 'effective intervention', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'mHealth', 'personalized medicine', 'post intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rate of change', 'relapse risk', 'theories', 'treatment duration', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,510240
"A data-driven approach to identify the neural and cognitive basis of social functioning in health and first episode psychosis Project Summary/Abstract: The research and training plan for this Fellowship will provide the applicant with significant and foundational training in cognitive neuroscience, advanced computational approaches and neuroimaging analysis to support her long-term career goal of becoming an independent researcher dedicated to enhancing functional recovery in schizophrenia. A core feature of schizophrenia is severe disability in social functioning, which places a high burden on individuals and society. Effective treatment development for social functioning deficits is hindered by the lack of well-defined neural and cognitive treatment targets. Recent advances suggest cortical loss in prefrontal and cingulate cortices may be linked to poor functioning in chronic schizophrenia, however the relationship between specific neural targets and social functioning in first episode psychosis (FEP), when individuals may have greater ability to engage in substantial recovery, is largely unknown. Further, social cognition deficits are strongly linked to poor functioning, but the relationship between cortical loss in social cognitive brain regions and social functioning remains to be established. The purpose of this study is to employ data-driven approaches to identify neural and social cognitive markers of social functioning in health and FEP to inform treatment target identification. This cross-sectional, secondary analysis leverages two unique datasets – a large sample of healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project (n=1113), and a sample of FEP participants enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial at the University of Minnesota (n=40). Specific Aim 1 - examine the relationships between gray matter volume and cortical thickness, social cognition and social functioning in healthy young adults using data driven approaches - will answer two research questions: 1a) what brain regions estimate better social functioning in healthy young adults, using regression-based machine learning analysis? and 1b) Is the relationship between social functioning and measures of gray matter volume and cortical thickness mediated by social cognition? We will then translate these findings to an FEP sample in Aim 2 - characterize the relationship between gray matter volume and cortical thickness and social functioning in FEP. This research will be supported by the applicant’s comprehensive training plan, her interdisciplinary mentoring team, and an ideal training environment due to its sophisticated neuroimaging and health informatics resources. This research is expected to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between the brain, social cognition and social functioning, which could lead to more targeted interventions for functional deficits in schizophrenia, alleviating suffering and addressing a critical public health need. The training will position the applicant to continue her trajectory to an independent career in translational cognitive neuroscience to enhance functional recovery through the development of neuroscience-informed interventions. Project Narrative: This research will identify relationships between neural substrate, social cognition and social functioning in healthy and first episode psychosis samples in order to identify the bio-behavioral processes that support social functioning and to identify potential neural treatment targets for improving social functioning deficits in psychotic disorders. This research aligns with the National Institute of Mental Health priority of elucidating the neural processes of complex behaviors to inform novel treatments. Identification of treatment biomarkers for social functioning is critical in order to advance treatment development and optimization for functional deficits in psychosis that will result in significant public health impact by reducing disability and promoting quality of life for individuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.",A data-driven approach to identify the neural and cognitive basis of social functioning in health and first episode psychosis,10153037,F31MH124278,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Social Development', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'aged', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'connectome', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'first episode psychosis', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social relationships', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'treatment optimization', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2021,41879
"Social Processing Deficits in Remitted Adolescent Depression Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and has a peak onset during adolescence. While interventions are moderately effective for many adolescents, 40 to 70% will relapse within 5 years. Further, MDD relapse predicts academic difficulties, risky behaviors, and suicide. Thus, identifying mechanisms of MDD relapse is critical to clarify intervention targets for this significant public health problem.  During adolescence, social processes and dynamics (especially with peers) are particularly significant, although it is unclear which social processes are most critical to MDD relapse. The present study focuses on the role of social communication, a set of mechanisms involving the receiving and delivery of socially relevant information. Social communication is especially significant to adolescents, as maladaptive social communication can negatively impact the establishment and maintenance of relationships, thus increasing risk for MDD relapse.  For the proposed study, we will employ an NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) lens and use multiple measures (behavior, event-related potentials [ERPs], eye tracking) to compare adolescents (aged 14-17 years) with remitted depression (remMDD; N=200) to healthy controls (HC; N=100) on deficits in several aspects of social communication, including: (i) processing of nonverbal social information, (ii) processing of socioemotional feedback, and (iii) digital communication. First, Aim 1 will test whether remMDD adolescents abnormally process two types of nonverbal social information—facial expressions (as indexed by reduced accuracy and abnormal ERPs [i.e., the N170]) and hand gesturing behaviors (assessed via eye-tracking). Second, Aim 2 will test whether remMDD adolescents abnormally process socioemotional feedback (being accepted versus rejected by same-aged peers), a well-established trigger of adolescent MDD. Specifically, Aim 2 will test whether remMDD adolescents exhibit a reduced Late Positive Potential [LPP]), an ERP indexing emotional encoding, following positive social feedback from faux peers during a peer evaluation task. Third, using an innovative smartphone app, Aim 3 will collect multiple indicators of digital communication regarding the structure of adolescents’ digital social network (i.e., size of the network; frequency of communication) and sentiment of the communication with their digital social network (i.e., coding sentiment from their texts, social media posts); allowing us to test whether remMDD adolescents exhibit abnormal digital communication. Last, we will follow adolescents for 1-year to determine whether processing of nonverbal information, social feedback, and digital communication predict the escalation of depression symptoms and MDD relapse. Further, supervised machine learning will explore which social communication deficit(s) predict symptoms or MDD relapse, and whether these social processes predict outcomes independent of (or interaction with) other established predictors of relapse (e.g., stressful life events). In summary, the project has the promise to identify social process that contribute to recurrent depression, which, ultimately, will lead to innovative treatment approaches. Project Narrative Depression in adolescence is common and recurrent. While social processes and dynamics are particularly significant in adolescence, it is unclear which social processes are most critical to depression relapse. The present study uses an RDoC “lens” to examine the role of multiple aspects of social communication to determine which social communication deficit predicts the escalation of depression symptoms and relapse during a 1-year follow-up period.",Social Processing Deficits in Remitted Adolescent Depression,10064641,R01MH119771,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gestures', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Social Network', 'Social Processes', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Youth', 'aged', 'child depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'negative affect', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'recurrent depression', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'showing emotion', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social communication', 'social media', 'stem', 'supervised learning', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,720319
"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.  REL EVAN CE (Se e in stru cti ons): The proposed research will develop and field test an innovative computationally-enabled personalized behavior change model that will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and is designed to be integrated into clinical practice.

"The Pathophysiological Role of Cerebellar Glia in Rett Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Rett  syndrome  (RTT)  is  the  leading  cause  of  severe  intellectual  disability  in  girls  and  women.  Individuals  with  RTT  develop  typically  until  6-­18  months,  when  autism-­like  behaviors  and  deficits  in  purposeful  hand  use  and  speech start to develop. Loss-­of-­function mutations in the transcriptional regulator methyl-­CpG-­binding protein   2  (MECP2)  occur  in  >95%  of  RTT  cases.  Initially,  researchers  regarded  MeCP2  deficiency  in  neurons  as  the  exclusive  cause  of  RTT.  However,  recent  studies  have  revealed  that  glia  have  a  pathological  role  in  RTT  etiology. Studies have not yet uncovered the underlying cellular mechanisms of glial cell dysfunction in Mecp2  rodent  models  or  the  impact  of  this  dysfunction  on  brain  function.  In  this  study,  we  propose  to  examine  the  contribution  of  a  specific  glial  subtype,  Bergmann  glia  cells  (BGs)  in  the  cerebellum,  to  the  motor  and  social  deficits  in  RTT.  We  will  focus  on  BGs  because  (1)  cerebellar  disruption  likely  contributes  to  the  motor  and  social  deficits  in  RTT  and  (2)  BGs  are  the  major  glial  subtype  in  the  cerebellum.  We  propose  to  characterize  cerebellar  function  in  conditional  knockout  (cKO)  mice  that  lack  Mecp2  in  BGs  using  a  repertoire  of  approaches,  including  intracellular  whole-­cell  recordings,  in  vivo  recordings  of  single  units  and  local  field  potentials,  in  vivo  and  ex  vivo  imaging  of  genetically-­encoded  Ca2+,  glutamate,  and  dopamine  (DA)  sensors  (GCaMP7,  iGluSnFr,  and  dLight1.1,  respectively),  optogenetics,  chemogenetics,  near  super-­resolution  confocal  microscopy,  and  behavioral  assessments  using  unbiased  machine-­learning  approaches.  Our  preliminary results indicate deficits in BGs from Mecp2-­deficient mice, including higher expression levels of the  GluA1  subunit  of  AMPA  receptors  (AMPARs),  and  depolarized  membrane  potentials.  In  addition,  we  have  preliminary evidence of DAergic modulation of BGs through the activation of D1 receptors (D1Rs) activated by  either electrical or optogenetic stimulation of DAergic inputs to the cerebellum. Of high relevance to motor and  social symptoms in RTT, the expression levels of D1Rs, which modulate GluA1 surface insertion, are higher in  Mecp2  KO  mice.  We  hypothesize  that  BGs  in  the  cerebellum  have  a  pathophysiological  role  in  motor  and  social  deficits  in  Mecp2-­deficient  mice.  We  propose  two  Aims:  (1)  Define  cerebellar  BG  dysfunction  in  Mecp2  cKO  mice;;  (2)  Characterize  DAergic  modulation  of  cerebellar  BGs  in  Mecp2  cKO  mice.  The  proposed  studies  will elucidate the consequences of impaired DAergic modulation of astrocyte function on cerebellar-­dependent  behaviors,  which  will  have  broad  implications  not  only  for  RTT  but  also  for  other  brain  disorders  associated  with cerebellar dysfunction.     PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by MECP2 mutations, presents with stereotypic hand movements, ambulatory difficulties, and social impairments. Dysfunctional interactions between glial cells and neurons and their modulation by dopamine may play crucial pathological roles in developing neurological symptoms.

"Feeding interaction network analyses enhance management of NHP breeding groups Abstract A primary mission of Animal Resources Divisions at National Primate Research Centers (NPRC) is to maintain the overall social health of Indian-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) living in large multi-generational breeding groups in order to ensure the availability of high-quality research subjects for NIH-funded research. The social dynamics of these breeding groups, however, are complex and disturbances in their dominance hierarchy and kinship structures can lead to increased aggression and fighting that may result in significant wounding. Thus, a common challenge in their management is the utilization of effective social heath surveillance methodology to identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of significant fighting. These captive groups are routinely monitored for changes in dominance ranks and rates of trauma to detect social instability at the family- and group-level; however, the precise timing of severe outbreaks of aggression is largely considered unpredictable. Further, the frequency of interactions that define dominance and affiliative relationships in these groups are sparse; thus, the gathering of enough behavioral data to unequivocally detect social instability is time- consuming. We recently published a report that indicated automated feeding data can provide critical real-time data and assist management with monitoring social stability in rhesus macaque breeding groups, by possibly predicting the timing of intense aggression. The purpose of this proposal is to expand upon these observations by establishing data-driven models that help management identify groups at risk for social instability. Because automated feeding data include precise timestamps and the order in which animals feed, network analyses can be used to construct Feeding Interaction Networks (FINs), allowing us to examine patterns of temporal proximity feeding among kin and non-kin. Because reproductive status also influences food intake in female monkeys, we will study six outdoor breeding groups at the Yerkes NPRC across the breeding and birthing seasons, and integrate social and reproductive data, with the overarching aim to develop comprehensive data-driven FIN models that will enhance colony management practices of NIH-supported rhesus macaque breeding colonies. Aim 1 will characterize the community structures within static FINs of rhesus macaque breeding groups, varying in size and composition. Aim 2 will determine whether the directionality and strength of connections between adult females within a static FIN can be used to predict patterns of affiliative and dominance relationships among kin and non-kin. Aim 3 will quantify and model the temporal changes of community structures within dynamic FINs of rhesus macaque groups across the breeding and birthing season with respect to female reproductive phase. Finally, Aim 4 will detect changes in the community structures of dynamic FINs, not associated with reproductive seasonality, that are precursor to increased aggression and other signs of social instability. These FIN models will be used to supplement behavioral and trauma data, allowing management to identify groups at risk for social instability and develop strategies to intervene prior to the escalation of additional aggression. Narrative The primary goal of this project is to use network analyses to construct a Feeding Interaction Network using automated feeding data collected from animals living in large breeding groups at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. If successful, these models will identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of fighting and injury. The application of automated feeding data in the social management of captive colonies of rhesus macaques represents a paradigm shift from more conventional practices.",Feeding interaction network analyses enhance management of NHP breeding groups,10090122,R24OD030035,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Breeding', 'Case Study', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Estradiol', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Injury', 'Intake', 'Lactation', 'Lead', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Ovulation', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primates', 'Progesterone', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'affiliative behavior', 'animal resource', 'behavior observation', 'cohesion', 'feeding', 'fighting', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'network models', 'pregnant', 'reproductive', 'season of birth', 'social', 'social attachment', 'social relationships', 'social unrest', 'wound']",OD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R24,2021,802738
"Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion Abstract: The effects of social relationships on management of health behaviors and adoption of positive wellness regimens has been well documented. In the era of digital and participatory health communication, the role of social ties in health promotion has become more complex. Online communities, which digitize peer-to-peer communication, provide a unique opportunity to researchers to understand collective social mechanisms as well as individual factors underlying human behavior change. Most studies of online and offline social networks have not considered the dynamics among communication intent and content with social influence. In the proposed research, we will develop a multi-dimensional methodological framework for social intercourse analysis to leverage the rich and voluminous data provided by online communities. Our framework aims to incorporate and integrate communication intent, semantics and structure of online communication to study sociobehavioral factors of health behaviors and chronic disease management, While our methods will be generally applicable, we will develop them in the context of health-related communication between members of online communities, particularly focusing on smoking cessation and diabetes management. This research proposal will result in- 1) new theoretical frameworks that describe the communication domain in a online social setting for behavior change, 2) scalable techniques to model expressions, semantics, and social dependencies associated self- reported health outcomes, and 3) new proposals for the development of data-driven sociobehavioral interventions to support individuals engaging in positive health behavior changes and chronic disease management. Project Narrative: This project enables retrospective analysis of social intercourse to facilitate our understanding of the associations between communication (content, intent, structure) and social influence dynamics underlying behavior change and chronic disease management as manifested in health-related member communication of online communities. As a component of the proposed research, we will integrate methods of discourse analysis, automated text analysis, and dynamic network models to analyze electronically captured peer-to-peer communication and characterize communication intent and content at scale. By enabling deeper analysis of communication in online platforms, resulting research can help achieve superior personalization of healthy living technologies and campaigns in offline and online formats.",Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion,10199050,R01LM012974,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discourse analysis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Semantics', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'behavior change', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'digital', 'experience', 'health management', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'network models', 'nicotine patch', 'online community', 'peer', 'psychosocial', 'role model', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social media', 'social relationships', 'supervised learning', 'virtual coach']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,343235
"The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay Project Summary The hippocampus is a critical site for rapid memory formation and retrieval, with extensively documented functions representing spatial and navigational variables, yet less is known of the means by which it guides behavior. Bursts of hippocampal activity identified in many species as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events are promising neural mechanisms to link hippocampal activity and behavioral function, since during SWRs hippocampus can represent positions the animal previously experienced, or will traverse in the near future. This proposal considers the food-caching behaviors of chickadees, who use a hippocampal-dependent, one- shot memory to guide cache retrieval. This behavior is exceptionally promising to link hippocampal activity to individual experiences, which has been a barrier to determining the nature of representations during SWR and their function in previous studies. These studies will develop a comprehensive account of how chickadee behavior is affected by cache site memory, determine whether SWRs are related to memory-specific components of caching behavior, and determine whether SWRs represent individual cache sites to assist later retrieval. I hypothesize that memory-guided behavior is distinguishable from random foraging. I will use video tracking to measure the behavioral microstructure of chickadee caching behavior, including postural and gaze time series, and develop quantitative models of behavioral motifs and their temporal structure. Using these tools to compare memory-guided and random foraging behaviors, I will develop decoders that indicate precisely how and when behavior appears memory-guided. I hypothesize that SWRs occur more often, and are more predictive of behavior, when behavior is memory- guided. I will use electrophysiology in freely moving chickadees during caching to relate SWRs to the microstructural analysis of behavior and decoding of behavioral strategy. I hypothesize that SWRs reactivate representations of previous, individual caching events, and that this reactivation improves subsequent retrieval for that individual site. Using electrophysiological recordings in caching birds, I will relate reactivations to the accuracy of retrieval behavior. Using online SWR detection and suppression, I will further determine if SWRs causally affect later retrieval behavior. Project Narrative Food caching birds are a unique model system for dissecting the fundamental principles of hippocampal function. Thorough characterization and computational modeling of this behavior, and the specific contribution of hippocampal memory, will allow insight into the neural mechanisms by which hippocampal representations guide behavior. We expect the principles resulting from this study to illuminate dysfunctions of memory present in many neurological disorders.",The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay,10162319,F32MH123015,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Future', 'Grain', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Series', 'Site', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'tool', 'way finding']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2021,71390
"Social Isolation and Discrimination as Stressors Influencing Brain-Gut Microbiome Alterations among Filipino and Mexican American ABSTRACT  Obesity is a major public health problem that is related to a variety of illnesses, such as heart disease and diabetes. Prior research indicates that social stressors contribute to risk for obesity, possibly through alterations in diet and physical activity. However, it is not fully clear how these alterations contribute to obesity. In this study, we examine how the stressors of social isolation and discrimination are related to eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and further, how these behaviors affect the brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) axis. Our prior research has suggested that BGM alterations play an important role in the development of obesity. Our study focuses on Mexican and Filipina women because research shows that they encounter a high burden of obesity as well as exposure to social stressors.  We will screen and enroll approximately 300 Mexican and Filipina women who will then provide information about social stressors via a survey, dietician-administered 24-hour food recall, measured anthropometrics (e.g. waist circumference), questionnaire data regarding diet and eating behaviors, and accelerometer data on physical activity. Stool and serum to determine microbial-related measures (16sRNA sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and metabolomics), and MRI to assess brain alterations in the extended reward network will be collected. Advanced multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate data from multiple data sources (neuroimaging, microbiome and metabolite profiles, survey data, diet, and clinical/behavioral data). This analysis will determine the unique variance associated with ethnicity and social stressors in moderating eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and the BGM axis related to obesity. An integrated systems investigative approach such as the one proposed is a critical step to understanding the mechanisms contributing to obesity. Further the impact of how environmental stressors “get under the skin” and impact eating behaviors and diet patterns and the BGM axis is important in addressing health disparities in ethnic groups and in women. This premise guides the specific aims of this proposal: Aim A: We will phenotype the influence of stressors on brain signatures and eating patterns in obesity. Aim B: We will phenotype the influence of stressors on gut microbiome and metabolites in obesity. Aim C: We will apply advanced analytical techniques in order to determine ethnic differences in the influence of stressors on the BGM axis in obesity.  The results of this study will provide novel information about a possible pathway whereby social stressors affect behavioral, neurological and microbiome mechanisms related to obesity risk. It will also provide new information in BGM patterns in two understudied ethnic groups. In the long term, this research may suggest possible approaches for intervention that may help reduce inequalities in obesity and related health problems. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study will provide new information about how social stressors contribute to obesity among Mexican and Filipino American women. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that stressors lead to eating behaviors and dietary changes and that alter the brain-gut-microbiome axis. A better understanding of the role of how stress “gets under the skin” to contribute to alterations in the brain and gut microbial metabolites in obesity, could lead to novel therapeutic strategies tailored to treat altered ingestive behaviors and obesity.",Social Isolation and Discrimination as Stressors Influencing Brain-Gut Microbiome Alterations among Filipino and Mexican American,10129475,R01MD015904,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Aromatic Amino Acids', 'Asians', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biology', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calories', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Fibrinogen', 'Filipino American', 'Firmicutes Bacteroidetes ratio', 'Food', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Mexican', 'Mexican Americans', 'Neurologic', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Palate', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Social Discrimination', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tryptophan', 'Woman', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'craving', 'dietary', 'dysbiosis', 'environmental stressor', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic minority population', 'food consumption', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'immune activation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'multiple data sources', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'recruit', 'response', 'sex', 'social culture', 'social stressor', 'stool sample', 'stressor', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning', 'waist circumference']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,779086
"Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum Heightened levels of social aggression, a motivated behavior, are often associated with neuropsychiatric disease. Although our understanding of the neural mechanisms regulating aggression is incomplete, both lateral septum (LS) and ventral hypothalamus are known to be important. Even though LS receives one of its strongest inputs from hippocampus, a region important for declarative memory, little is known about how hippocampus regulates aggression. Moreover, as hippocampus is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered social behavior and aggression, a basic understanding of how hippocampus and its circuitry regulate aggression will likely yield important new insights into disease mechanisms.  Here we focus on the role of the hippocampal CA2 region in social aggression. Relatively little is known about CA2, largely because of technical problems that limit its study with conventional lesioning approaches. We therefore developed a Cre mouse line that enables us to label and manipulate the activity of CA2 pyramidal neurons. Using a genetic silencing approach, we found that CA2 was critical during non-aggressive social exploration for the formation of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember another mouse (conspecific), but CA2 was not needed for other forms of hippocampal memory. Our recent results now show that CA2 also promotes social aggression, through an excitatory projection to LS that disinhibits a subnucleus in ventral medial hypothalamus important for aggression. Moreover, we find that the social neuropeptide arginine vasopressin promotes aggression by enhancing the CA2 to LS synapse.  Here we ask: How does a single brain region, CA2, participate in social memory storage during non- aggressive social exploration and promote social aggression? Is there a single population of CA2 neurons that is activated during both social exploration and social aggression? Or are there specialist neurons for each behavior? Does CA2 actively encode distinct representations of social exploration and social aggression, or does CA2 encode a single social salience signal that does not in itself encode aggression but that is gated by the internal state of an animal to promote aggression through CA2 inputs to LS? We will test the hypothesis that vasopressin release in LS acts as such a permissive gate. As vasopressin also enhances social memory by acting within CA2, we will ask: How can a single neuromodulator produce two such distinct actions? Do distinct sources of vasopressin input to CA2 and LS promote, respectively, social memory and aggression?  We will address these questions by characterizing CA2 circuits and neural activity during aggressive and non-aggressive social interactions using: 1. Activity-dependent genetic marking of active CA2 ensembles; 2. Electrophysiological characterization of CA2?LS circuits and their regulation by vasopressin in ex vivo brain slices; 3. Behavioral control of aggression using chemogenetics and optogenetics; and 4. In vivo optical and electrophysiological recordings of CA2 activity during non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with increased levels of aggression, which impair patient care and place a burden on society. Here we will examine the neural mechanisms by which the CA2 region of the hippocampus, a relatively unexplored brain region implicated in social memory and schizophrenia, regulates aggressive behavior in mice.",Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum,10226105,R01MH120292,"['Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Argipressin', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Genetic', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Impairment', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Lesion', 'Locales', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Middle Hypothalamus', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Vasopressins', 'anatomical tracing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'maternal aggression', 'motivated behavior', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,462162
"Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (“naturalistic”) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y). The goal of this application is to investigate the neural mechanisms of multi-dimensional emotional and social representation. Functional MRI experiments are proposed to investigate the following general questions: organization and evolution of brain networks; naturalistic processing during movie watching; and development.",Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing,10120523,R01MH112517,"['Adolescence', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'age group', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'movie', 'neglect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive mood', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social neuroscience', 'young adult']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2021,584996
"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY – Parent U01  Emerging adulthood (ages 18-29 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance; therefore, to ad- dress this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, re- active processes are difficult to measure because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect inten- sive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. Data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within- days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learn- ing to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and meth- ods will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Health Behavior Network’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE - Parent U01 Weight gain increases dramatically emerging adulthood, increasing risk of cancer and chronic disease later in life. This study will use mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data on micro-temporal mechanisms underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, limited sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration in emerging adults.

"Organizational and Cultural Dynamics in Genomics Companies: Industry Engagement in Navigating Social and Ethical Issues This K99/R00 Award is designed to generate scholarship and interventions to guide genomics companies towards more just practices. It does so through a five-year training and research project, which investigates perspectives from members of the genomics industry, and leverages them to inform normative analyses and identify feasible paths towards concrete change. The project addresses issues of price, access and industrial control, with a focus on the ethics of profit and social responsibility. Through the proposed training program, the project prepares the candidate as an independent scholar whose research program links empirical and normative research with practical interventions to positively influence ethics and justice in private sector genomics. The first phase of research (conducted during the K phase, alongside training activities) is a comparative study examining social and cultural factors involved in perceptions of ethical issues among members of industry. The comparative study focuses on three biotech hubs in the US (the Bay Area, San Diego, and Boston), as well as an additional site in South Africa (Cape Town). The South African site helps place investigation of the US industry in light of a shifting global industry, and especially South Africa’s policy focus on genomics for population health (as well as its role in the H3Africa initiative). The study also considers industry subsector and individual company culture, in examining influences on industry approaches to social and ethical issues. During its R phase, the project then involves a systematic normative analysis of profit and social obligation in the genomics industry, based on key theories from bioethics and business ethics. The project will then feed this scholarly analysis back to industry stakeholders; using a Delphi study, it allows members of industry to use results of the normative analysis in strategizing interventions with the greatest likelihood of influencing the genomics industry in ethically desirable ways. This project addresses the NHGRI ELSI research priorities of genomic equity and social justice, as well as genomics and public health. Its career development plan focuses on training in normative analysis and Delphi methods, as well as content training in genomics and entrepreneurship. The training will be conducted at Johns Hopkins University, where the school’s preeminent bioethics center houses world experts in qualitative and quantitative empirical bioethics, alongside the University’s leading research and training in the biomedical sciences and their application in industry. The integrated research and training plan will prepare the candidate as an independent ELSI scholar with a rigorous research program focused on empirical and normative analysis of the business of biomedicine and genomics, and engagement with industry stakeholders. This Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) investigates and leverages perspectives from members of the health-related private sector genomics industry, to develop guidance for improving approaches to social and ethical issues in the industry. It does so through in-depth qualitative analysis (interviews, cases studies, comparative analysis), scholarly normative analysis (drawing on theories from bioethics and business ethics), and a Delphi process of iterative questionnaires with industry stakeholders, aimed at strategizing concrete change regarding social obligations of the industry.

"WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild Project Summary Behavioral interventions for weight loss include self-monitoring and self-report of diet. However, few people adhere to self-monitoring because they believe it will be a burden. For those who do adhere, biased reporting leads to poor accuracy. Self-report measures have helped us understand contextual factors of problematic eating behaviors, but we cannot validate such relationships to dietary intake and weight because of unreliable reporting. Therefore, we need an objective way to validate self-report measures. Automated self-monitoring, however, can lead to high eating false alarm detection rates (calling something eating when it is not eating). It also requires participants to push buttons during the start and end of a meal. Passive and unobtrusive ways to capture images of food intake would improve accuracy of detection, avoid the need for a person to remember what they ate, and limit bias based on what participants believe to be socially desirable. Such methods could also ease the self-monitoring burden, decrease errors associated with self- report measures, and lay the foundation for understanding when and how problematic eating behaviors occur. Image capture using wearable cameras may help us better understand obesity and its context (that is, the situation in which eating occurs). However, privacy and ethical concerns of bystanders whose images are taken are a significant barrier. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that participants are both willing to wear and that provides meaningful information on food intake and context associated with problematic eating behaviors. Several methods exist, known as obfuscation, that can filter unnecessary information in the scene. However, we do not know which method is most acceptable to a person wearing the device in everyday life that would encourage greatest wear-time. Our project aims to determine which method is best for preserving privacy while providing enough information to understand eating behaviors and their context. To do this, we will observe participants in their everyday life, with special attention to eating behaviors. We will use these new image capture techniques to help understand eating behaviors associated with obesity. First, we will select the best obfuscation method by testing the most well-known obfuscation methods in a cross-over trial to identify which method has the greatest participant acceptability and feasibility (compared with no obfuscation). We will test a novel wearable camera with an infrared sensor (allows us to determine objects that are near vs. far in the camera) with 3 obfuscation methods in real-world settings, including a cartooning gaming–based method. We will then select the obfuscation method that increases wear time and design an eating algorithm around it. Using this algorithm we will assess our ability to capture behaviorally meaningful context from the obfuscated image, such as whether people are eating alone or not, at home, using screen time, and eating prepared or cooked food. This will improve current research practices of evaluating dietary intake and pave the way for personalized interventions in behavioral medicine. Project Narrative Obesity treatment would benefit greatly from an accurate understanding of problematic eating behaviors in real-world settings. Wearable video cameras provide significant utility in understanding eating behaviors, yet pose a major privacy concern in the real-world, significantly impacting longitudinal wear time. We are testing a privacy-conscious wearable device that individuals with obesity will wear and that can accurately detect eating, which will advance our understanding of behavioral phenotypes surrounding obesity, laying the foundation for future interventions to change problematic eating behaviors.",WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild,10109884,R03DK127128,"['Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Cartoons', 'Chest', 'Clinical Research', 'Conscious', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food', 'Food Patterns', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population Research', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Reading', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Social Desirability', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'adult obesity', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'contextual factors', 'cooking', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'experience', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized intervention', 'preservation', 'privacy preservation', 'sensor', 'tv watching', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'weight loss intervention', 'willingness']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2021,116737
"Computational and electrochemical substrates of social decision-making in humans SUMMARY Dopamine and serotonin systems in the human brain represent two key neuromodulatory signalling systems that impact mood, value-based decision-making, learning, and a host of other cognitive functions. Despite their importance, there is no consensus view from a psychological or computational perspective concerning their exact information-processing functions. Consequently, there is a scarceness of strategies to treat disorders that afflict these systems. We believe that this gap exists primarily because of methodological limitations. While there are many fast methods for recording action potential activity and local field potentials, similar progress for tracking `the other end of the problem' - neurochemical dynamics - has lagged far behind. This is unfortunate since just considering the catecholamines dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, the worldwide health burden of dysfunction in these neuromodulatory systems is immense approaching 400 million people worldwide if one includes just Major Depression and Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders (WHO, 2017). The overall goal of this project is to investigate the computational and neuromodulatory substrates of interactive social processes hypothesized to be trans-diagnostic RDoC constructs. We will utilize two levels of analysis (molecules/circuits and behavioral/computational) across two RDoC constructs (systems for social processes: perception and understanding of others, subconstruct understanding mental states, and positive valence systems: reward learning, subconstruct reward prediction error) to make inroads into understanding the computational and neural underpinnings of social interaction in humans. Crucially, the interactive social tasks used in this proposal generate an important class of learning signal – a reward prediction error signal – but expressed in the context of an inter-personal interaction. Our two levels of analysis employ (1) computational models of human (two-agent) social exchange estimated from detailed, observed behavior and (2) unique sub- second measurements of dopamine and serotonin from human striatum (three separate sites: caudate, putamen, ventral striatum) during the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation surgery for Parkinson's Disease, Essential Tremors, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Dopamine and serotonin jointly influence a broad range of healthy cognition and changes in their delivery or action are thought to underpin a variety of pathological conditions including major depressive disorder, drug addiction, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's Disease. During the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation, we will make the first recordings of joint dopamine and serotonin dynamics in the striatum of conscious humans during the execution of inter-personal social exchange games.

"Using natural language processing to determine predictors of healthy diet and physical activity behavior change in ovarian cancer survivors ABSTRACT Cancer survivors are a growing population in the United States; more than 16 million currently live in the US and by 2030 this number is expected to exceed 22 million. It is estimated that more than 50 percent of new cancer cases could be eliminated through a combination of healthy behaviors (e.g., physical activity and healthy diet); and cancer survivors are at high risk for developing new and recurrent cancer. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of cancer survivors are not attaining the cancer preventive guidelines of healthy diet and physical activity. In the past few decades, a variety of telephone-based lifestyle interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in helping survivors meet cancer preventive guidelines, however these trials are labor intensive and expensive to deliver, limiting their potential for broad dissemination. We propose to address this hurdle by taking advantage of recent advances in artificial intelligence to reduce the cost and maximize the impact of these much-needed interventions. Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are analytical techniques that automatically learn from direct and indirect patterns in data. We propose to use machine learned algorithms to analyze speech to aid in predicting who may be at risk of poor adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors. These speech data will come from the Lifestyle Intervention for Ovarian cancer Enhanced Survival (LIVES) study, a telephone-based lifestyle intervention testing whether a diet low in fat and high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber, coupled with increased physical activity will increase time to disease progression in 1200 ovarian cancer survivors who have recently completed treatment, as compared to an attention control. Intervention coaches employed motivational interviewing to elicit behavior change and all calls on the LIVES trial were recorded with repeat assessments of diet, physical activity, patient reported and clinical outcomes. We will use this existing and robust longitudinal data set, which pairs conversational speech data with explicit outcomes, to achieve the following objectives. 1) Develop a ML model to identify patterns in the interactions between coaches and their participants that signal a likelihood of optimal behavior change in diet and physical activity given the comprehensive LIVES data set, utilizing voice recorded calls, demographics, and clinical and patient reported outcomes collected at multiple time points. 2) Decompose the ML model in terms of “intervenable factors”, so that participant affect, coach adherence to the intervention protocol, and other important aspects of the interaction can be individually evaluated for their role in predicting behavior change, as well as adherence to intervention goals. This decomposition will directly enable early and targeted adjustments to intervention plans for individuals, reducing the cost and increasing the efficacy of intervention strategies. ML and NLP methods can produce models that listen to a coaching conversation and automatically predict whether it will result in positive change towards enactment of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Such predictive models would enable more efficient, effective, and individualized lifestyle interventions, the first step towards personalized behavioral medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study examines whether artificial intelligence can use speech and audio from health coaching calls to predict who is most likely to enact healthy lifestyle behaviors of diet and physical activity. This project uses previously collected data from the Lifestyle Intervention for Ovarian Cancer Enhanced Survival (LIVES) Study to 1) Develop a machine learning model to identify patterns in the interactions between coaches and their participants that signal a likelihood of optimal behavior change of healthy lifestyle and 2) Decompose the machine learning model in terms of “intervenable factors”, so that participant affect, coach adherence to fidelity protocols, and other important aspects of the interaction can be individually evaluated for their role in predicting healthy lifestyle behavior change and adherence to intervention goals.",Using natural language processing to determine predictors of healthy diet and physical activity behavior change in ovarian cancer survivors,10109452,R21CA256680,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Fruit', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health education', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrent Malignant Neoplasm', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trial of Labor', 'United States', 'Vegetables', 'Voice', 'anticancer research', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral adherence', 'behavioral outcome', 'cancer therapy', 'cost', 'demographics', 'experience', 'good diet', 'healthy lifestyle', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle data', 'lifestyle intervention', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2021,209312
"A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication PROJECT SUMMARY We will develop novel computer vision tools to reliably and precisely measure nonverbal social communication through quantifying communicative facial and bodily expressions. Our tools will be designed and developed in order to maximize their usability by non-engineer behavioral scientists, filling the enormous gap between engineering advances and their clinical accessibility. Significance: Social interaction inherently relies on perception and production of coordinated face and body expressions. Indeed, atypical face and body movements are observed in many disorders, impacting social interaction and communication. Traditional systems for quantifying nonverbal communication (e.g., FACS, BAP) require extensive training and coding time. Their tedious coding requirements drastically limits their scalability and reproducibility. While an extensive literature exists on advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques for face and body analysis, there is no well-established method commonly used in mental health community to quantify production of facial and bodily expressions or efficiently capture individual differences in nonverbal communication in general. As a part of this proposal, we will develop a computer vision toolbox including tools that are both highly granular and highly scalable, to allow for measurement of complex social behavior in large and heterogeneous populations. Approach: Our team will develop tools that provide granular metrics of nonverbal social behavior, including localized face and body kinematics, characteristics of elicited expressions, and imitation performance. Our tools will facilitate measurement of social communication both within a person and between people, to allow for assessment of individual social communication cues as well as those that occur within bidirectional social contexts. Preliminary Data: We have developed and applied novel computer vision tools to assess: (1) diversity of mouth motion during conversational speech (effect size d=1.0 in differentiating young adults with and without autism during a brief natural conversation), (2) interpersonal facial coordination (91% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis in young adults during a brief natural conversation, replicated in an independent child sample), and (3) body action imitation (85% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis based on body imitation performance). As apart of current proposal, we will develop more generic methods that can be used in normative and clinical samples. Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop tools to automatically quantify fine-grained face movements and their coordination during facial expression production; in Aim 2, we will develop tools to quantify body joint kinematics and their coordination during bodily expression production; in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the tools’ ability to yield dimensional metrics using machine learning. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of nonverbal social communication, providing a scalable solution to measure individual variability, within a dimensional and transdiagnostic framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project develops novel tools for measuring nonverbal social communication as manifested through facial and bodily expressions. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning methodologies, we will quantify humans’ communicative social behavior. The results of this project will impact public health by facilitating a rich characterization of normative development of social functioning, providing access to precise phenotypic information for neuroscience and genetics studies, and by measuring subtle individual differences to determine whether some interventions or treatments work better than others.",A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication,10150095,R01MH122599,"['Adolescent', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral health', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'open source', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'tool', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,660945
"Improving Telerehabilitation in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy Using Machine Learning and Social Robots PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder in young children. There is no cure, but disciplined rehabilitation can improve outcomes. A critical component of rehabilitation is continuous assessment of patient function. Patients in rural areas can have difﬁculty accessing care. Telerehabilitation provides an option to extend access to care, but has limitations. The foci of this project are 1) understanding how a social robot physically co-located with the patient during a telerehabilitation assessment alters the activity by the patient, potentially leading to changes in the ability of the clinician to perform assessment and 2) whether computer vision and machine learning can be used to assess patients. Together, these two complementary goals will show a path forward for remote treatment of patients with CP and similar conditions.  The effect of using a social robot in telerehabilitation will be examined through a study where pediatric CP subjects and typical subjects interact with a remote operator in three conditions: face-to-face, over traditional telepresence, and over telepresence with a social robot present. Direct changes in the level of subject interaction and compliance will be measured through surveys and video coding. The effect on quality of assessment will be measured by presenting expert therapists with ﬁrst-person video recordings from each condition and comparing the variance of their grading for each condition.  To truly realize the promise of using remote assessment to extend care, automated grading of assessments is necessary. To evaluate the feasibility of this, videos of children with various levels of upper extremity function along with their box and block scores and clinician ratings will be used to train two algorithms. Both algorithms will begin by using off the shelf convolutional neural network based tools to extract the pose of the subjects. The ﬁrst algorithm will be hand designed. It will learn how to weight known metrics of motion, such as movement speed, time to maximum speed, and number of speed peaks, using principal component analysis and a naive Gaussian classiﬁer. The second algorithm will use a custom neural network operating directly on the time-series pose data. Both algorithms will attempt to, given video of a novel subject, predict the level of function as would be predicted by a therapist. Both algorithms will be analyzed to discover their underlying decision-making philosophies, which may give insight into what parameters of motion clearly differentiate levels of function.  The project will be done in the context of a pre-doctoral training plan. The plan focuses on developing an independent researcher at the intersection of robotics and rehabilitation science. This will be done within Mechanical Engineering, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception (GRASP) laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania with additional mentorship and experience at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. PROJECT NARRATIVE Limits to care for pediatric cerebral palsy patients in rural areas could be addressed through telepresence, but current technologies fail to adequately convey information. This project will explore whether combining social robots with telepresence systems and computer vision can improve the quality of telerehabilitation for the purpose of remote assessment. The social robot will aid communication to the patient, motivating them through activities, while the computer vision automatically assesses function.",Improving Telerehabilitation in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy Using Machine Learning and Social Robots,10285983,F31HD102165,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Automation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Background', 'Engineering', 'Exercise', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Improve Access', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Network-based', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Philadelphia', 'Philosophy', 'Physical Medicine', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'communication aid', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'motor disorder', 'neural network', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'peer', 'pre-doctoral', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation science', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'rural area', 'social assistive robot', 'telepresence', 'telerehabilitation', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,46036
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,10063429,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computer science', 'craving', 'dietary', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obese person', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2021,165181
"Multimodal, integrated analysis of neural activity and naturalistic social behavior in freely moving mice Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal responds to an NIMH notice NOT-MH-18-036 aimed at the development and study of novel, computationally defined behavioral assays, and at applying theory and mathematical modeling to better capture the richness of complex, naturalistic behaviors. Specifically, we aim to develop novel computational tools for analyzing social behaviors in freely moving mice, and relating those identified behaviors to neural circuit activity in brain regions that govern the expression of those behaviors. Social behavior is affected in many human psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. We propose an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to fill two major gaps that present a barrier to studies of social behavior: 1) the lack of quantitative and high-resolution descriptions of naturalistic social behaviors in freely moving animals, and 2) the difficulty of relating neural activity recorded in deep subcortical regions that govern such behaviors, such as the hypothalamus and extended amygdala, to animals' actions or to models of behavioral control. Our objective is to create a computational behavior analysis platform that integrates automated measurement of naturalistic social behavior, synchronous large-scale recording or imaging of neural activity, and apply these to a novel assay to investigate social behavioral decision-making. The central objective of this proposal is to extend our Mouse Action Recognition System (MARS) to create a platform that allows facile training of supervised and unsupervised behavior classifiers, quantitative correlation with simultaneously acquired neural recording or imaging data, and which can be flexibly adapted to additional behavior assays. The rationale for this approach is that fine-grained quantification of social behavior, and its correlation with neural recordings, is necessary to form and test theories of behavioral control by subcortical brain regions. While automated tracking and “pose” estimation software such as DeepLabCut have made tracking of animals' body positions more feasible, the identification of social behaviors from pose data is a non-trivial problem, requiring a separate computational approach that takes into account the relative movements of multiple animals over time. To achieve our objective, we will broaden the palette of social behaviors MARS can detect using machine learning and generative models (Aim 1), develop methods to relate those behaviors to neural activity (Aim 2), and extend MARS to additional assays to study neural correlates of social decision-making. This contribution is significant because it will create a resource that will transform our ability to study micro- and meso-scale subcortical circuits controlling social behavior. The contribution is innovative because it combines expertise from circuit neuroscience and computer vision/machine learning to create new tools for understanding the link between neural activity and behavior, in a context that is relevant to understanding dysfunctions of neural circuits that underlie human psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it develops new methods to investigate the neural circuits governing naturalistic social behaviors in animal models, and such behaviors are often disrupted in human psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. Our objective is to use computer vision and machine learning algorithms (AI) to produce detailed and reproducible measurements capturing the richness of social behaviors, and to correlate those behaviors with simultaneously recorded neural activity in freely interacting animals. We apply these techniques in established and novel social behavior assays to test hypotheses about the neural mechanisms underlying social behavioral decision-making.","Multimodal, integrated analysis of neural activity and naturalistic social behavior in freely moving mice",10226273,R01MH123612,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Population Dynamics', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Reciprocal Social Interaction', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Identification', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'body position', 'collaborative approach', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social defeat', 'social structure', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,416250
"Optimized Affective Computing Measures of Social Processes and Negative Valence in Youth Psychopathology ABSTRACT Difficulties with emotion expression and social behavior characterize multiple psychiatric conditions and negatively impact child development. However, existing measurement tools for indexing social-emotional function are imprecise and subjective, or require specialized training that is costly and time-intensive, prohibiting widespread implementation. The imprecision of existing tools has a major negative impact not only on research, but on the ability to assess and treat individuals with mental health concerns – especially among underserved and under-resourced populations. Here, we propose to address this problem by quantifying social and emotional behavior using novel biobehavioral markers derived from computer vision (facial expression analysis) and computational linguistics (social/sentiment analysis). Our team has successfully used these markers to predict the presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with 91% accuracy. In this proposal, we determine the extent to which our markers can serve as continuous measures of social behavior and negative emotion to advance clinical phenotyping and interventions. The proposal brings together two high-bandwidth clinical research programs at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Baylor College of Medicine to collect data on 750 adolescents (ages 12-17 inclusive) with ASD, a primary anxiety or depressive disorder, or without any developmental/psychiatric condition. At a single assessment, all youth will participate in an extensive clinical phenotyping battery consisting of validated clinical interviews and child-/parent-report scales assessing converging and diverging mental health constructs, and three tasks eliciting positive/negative emotion, social stress, and mild frustration. A subsample of 150 adolescents will be reassessed 6-10 weeks later to allow retest/stability analyses. A novel camera apparatus will capture naturalistic synchronized verbal and nonverbal signals from dyads. Our analytic approach combines state-of-the-art machine learning, computational linguistics, and computer vision – including facial emotion recognition methods that rival several commonly used alternatives. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop valid and objective measures of the Social and Negative Valence Systems using novel biobehavioral markers in a large transdiagnostic sample of youth. Secondary goals are to develop easy-to-follow methods to widely disseminate our tools and procedures, and to characterize individual variability in these key RDoC metrics by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and diagnosis. The achievement of these goals will provide researchers with sorely needed measures of social and emotional behavior, and provide clinicians with a new set of tools for identifying and tracking youth in need of mental health treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with negative emotion and social behavior are present across many behavioral health conditions, but are poorly measured with existing tools. This application addresses this problem by developing and validating novel facial expression and linguistic measures that can be easily and widely disseminated across research and clinical settings.",Optimized Affective Computing Measures of Social Processes and Negative Valence in Youth Psychopathology,10183399,R01MH125958,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Factor Analysis', 'Frustration', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smiling', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Processes', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trier Social Stress Test', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'affective computing', 'aged', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral health', 'biobehavior', 'clinical phenotype', 'college', 'cost', 'digital', 'emotional behavior', 'emotional functioning', 'experimental study', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'natural language', 'novel', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social deficits', 'social metrics', 'social stress', 'tool']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,861615
"ARGUS-MDS: automated, quantitative and scalable system for social processes in behavioral health Argus Cognitive STTR Grant Application Abstract Standardized behavioral observation methods are integral to developmental, educational, and behavioral science research. However, existing observational strategies are too laborious to use in large-scale, intervention and dissemination trials needed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In addition, current observational strategies do not yield sufficiently quantitative, comparable and granular assessment that could drive the comparison of therapies in clinical trials or the optimization and personalization of intervention. We are developing a minimally intrusive medical device technology (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously monitor multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Our team represents an essential collaboration between computer and clinical scientists with expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), NDDs, diagnostics, multi-modal interventions, and psychometrics. We seek support in the form of a Fast Track STTR grant to validate the psychometric properties of ARGUS-MDS and its ability to provide data on change in target behaviors in early childhood and school-aged children. This would then support the development of a scalable, digital treatment progress indicator for behaviors reflecting social, repetitive behavior, and associated symptom profiles in ASD. In Phase I, video and audio data will be collected during gold-standard diagnostic evaluations individuals with ASD (n=15). Aim 1.1 will establish quality and clinical validity of ARGUS-MDS algorithms for key social communication behaviors, while Aim 1.2 will evaluate test-retest reliability of biometric output. Phase I will show that ARGUS-MDS meets quality metrics for biometric output, validates the clinician- technician feedback system, and establishes intraclass correlation coefficients for automated social communication (AutoSC) output. In Phase II our focus shifts to establishing psychometric properties of derived scores for AutoSC analysis, evaluating convergence with established clinical and functional measures, and preparing for regulatory filing in Phase III. Aim 2.1. will develop scores from biometric data through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of social communication behaviors. Aim 2.2 evaluates correspondence of AutoSC scores to scores on standardized clinical assessments. Aim 2.3 develops a comprehensive Validation Strategy and executes Analytical Validation, per medical device design control regulation and FDA guidance. Phase II will develop scores from AutoSC output, evaluate measurement characteristics of AutoSC scores, reliability & validity of Autos SC scores, and executes all Analytical Validations per the strategy document and FDA guidance. Phase I and II milestones will set us up for commercialization in Phase III, including filing for regulatory approval and product launch. Successful completion of this project will provide a novel, scalable medical device technology to support objective, automated clinical evaluations of social impairments in ASD and other NDDs. Argus Cognitive STTR Grant Application NARRATIVE We seek to contribute to the digital health movement through validation of a minimally intrusive monitoring system (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously track multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). This new technology will make diagnosis and monitoring of these disorders quantitative, scalable, and affordable, removing a serious bottleneck in the current patient journey, related to 1) the limited availability of highly trained human experts and 2) the qualitative and subjective nature of the results attained with current observational strategies. Using advanced video and audio analytics and machine learning, ARGUS-MDS achieves an automated, quantitative, and comprehensive assessment of each patient, across settings (clinical trials, academic research, specialty clinics, pediatric offices and homes), without requiring the presence of a human expert during the monitored diagnostic, monitoring or therapy sessions.","ARGUS-MDS: automated, quantitative and scalable system for social processes in behavioral health",10019734,R44MH121965,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Factor Analysis', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Trial', 'Language', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Problem behavior', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Processes', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'analog', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'behavior observation', 'behavioral health', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'communication behavior', 'digital health', 'digital treatment', 'disability', 'dissemination trial', 'early childhood', 'experimental study', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'motor control', 'multi-component intervention', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'social reciprocity']",NIMH,"ARGUS COGNITIVE, INC.",R44,2021,485065
"Developing deep learning algorithms for studying infant brain and behavior relationships Project Summary Infants communicate to their caregivers that they need food by crying. This represents our very first social interaction that lays the foundation for a healthy life by acquiring nutrition for growth and establishing a strong social bond with caregivers. Infants that cannot regulate their nutrition are at risk for malnourishment or obesity, whose deleterious effects will negatively impact the wellness of these individuals for their lifetime. Abnormalities in social recognition and communication, like those found in autism spectrum disorders, also become apparent during infancy. Despite the critical importance of infants communicating nutritional need to caregivers, the neuronal basis remains unknown. To address this deficit, I propose to study social tadpoles that beg their parents for food by dancing. Tadpoles use this begging display to encode nutritional state, enabling us to quantify hunger- based communication. These tadpoles are translucent, allowing us to visualize the development and activity of neurons in the brain. I am combining this novel model system and behavioral paradigm with advanced neurogenetic tools to interrogate the neuronal substrates of hunger-based communication. I will examine whether nutritional quality influences the development of neurons that regulating feeding and communication with in vivo brain imaging. I will also test for a functional role of these neuronal cell-types in begging behavior using a high throughput behavior assay, whole brain clearing and immunohistochemistry, and cell-specific manipulations of neuronal activity. As social recognition is important for establishing parent-offspring bonds, I will then use in vivo neural activity imaging to determine how tadpoles recognize their parents using multi-modal sensory integration. Completion of these experiments will transform our understanding of a social behavior critical for infant survival and life-long wellbeing. There is a pressing need for this research because there are currently no established models for studying the neural mechanisms of infant communication of hunger. This work is important to public health because some of the most prevalent disorders afflicting children in the United States are eating related disorders and conditions involving abnormalities in social recognition and communication, such as autism spectrum disorders. More research on infant feeding and communication is needed to better understand these pathologies in the youngest members of our society. Narrative Communication of nutritional need during infancy is our very first social interaction, laying the foundation for a healthy life by acquiring nutrition for growth and establishing strong social bonds with caregivers. The proposed work uses a unique biological model – social tadpoles that communicate nutritional need to their caregivers – to uncover how infants evaluate their nutritional state, recognize their caregivers, and communicate that they need food. These studies have implications for informing preventative strategies and treatments for childhood obesity and autism spectrum disorders, two of the most prevalent diseases afflicting the youngest members of our society.",Developing deep learning algorithms for studying infant brain and behavior relationships,10263607,DP2HD102042,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Communication', 'Critical Thinking', 'Crying', 'Dancing', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Eating', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hunger', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Behavior', 'Life', 'Methodology', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Study models', 'Tadpoles', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cell type', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'member', 'multimodality', 'neurogenetics', 'neuromechanism', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity in children', 'offspring', 'parent grant', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'skills', 'social', 'social attachment', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP2,2021,86547
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,10162316,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'shared database', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,581743
"An Electronic Health Record-Based Tool to Identify Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients at Risk of Low Social Support ABSTRACT Social support, a social determinant of health (SDoH), is a definitive predictor of breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes. Because of the recognition that social support is critical to BC patient outcomes, clinicians within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) have documented information on social support in the electronic health record (EHR) since the advent of Epic in 2005. However, no EHR-based social support measure currently exists to help clinicians identify patients at high risk of low social support. Such a measure has high relevance for addressing racial/ethnic disparities in BC treatment and outcomes. Therefore, we propose to develop an Electronic Health Record Social Support Patient Risk Tool (EHR-SUPPORT) that could be used to identify women with BC at risk of low social support for referral to social support resources. We propose to: 1) Identify terms in the EHR, based on theory and prior literature, and informed by KPNC stakeholders in BC care, that reflect structural and/or functional social support, and have been associated with BC treatment and outcomes; 2) Develop EHR-SUPPORT, using structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (to include natural language processing of text) that identifies patients at risk of low social support, overall and by race/ethnicity, and validate the measure against published social support measures; and 3) Evaluate associations of EHR-SUPPORT and its component variables with BC treatment (surgery and chemotherapy delays, nonadherence to hormonal therapy) and BC-specific and total mortality, overall and by race/ethnicity in 44,348 women diagnosed with stage I-IV BC within Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2006- 2023 including 3,450 Black, 4,441 Hispanic, 6,571 Asian women, and 28,589 non-Latina white women. In an exploratory aim, we will develop, with KP clinician stakeholders, steps to the implementation of EHR- SUPPORT. We will review 100 medical records (25 in each race/ethnic group) within two months of diagnosis, informed by investigator expertise and clinician stakeholders, to develop terms used to describe patient support. In addition to developing structured data, we will use natural language processing of text fields to further develop social support indicators (Aim 1). EHR-SUPPORT will be computed from social support indicators; we will use linear and logistic regression to validate the developed measure against established social support measures in Pathways, a well-established cohort of 4,505 women with BC and use factor analytic and confirmatory factor analytic methods as well as ROC curves to further evaluate the score (Aim 2). We will use linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate associations in Aim 3. The unique convergence of EHR and cohort data provides the first opportunity to develop and validate an EHR- based social support measure in in diverse women with BC, adjusted for an extensive set of covariates. This work is central to identifying patients at elevated risk of low social support and to enhancing social support- cancer research needed to improve clinical care and reduce BC disparities.

"Social-Affective Vulnerability to Suicidality among LGBTQ Young Adults: Proximal and Distal Factors Project Summary/Abstract Rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) among young adults have reached a crisis level, especially for those in the LGBTQ (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, questioning and/or transgender) population, who face social stigma in addition to the typical developmental challenges. Although we know the general risk factors for suicide, those have limited utility in predicting how, when, and in whom suicide occurs. It is critically important to consider the role of social context because STB often occurs in response to a recent social threat event such as rejection and could be more likely in those who have altered sensitivity of neural social circuitry. The proposed R01 study in response to RFA MH-20-327 builds on social models such as Minority Stress Theory and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and examines social risk factors of STB from distal to proximal levels. The overarching goal is to predict change in STB, including cumulative intensity of STB and transition from suicidal thoughts to behaviors, on a time scale from hours to days to months. We propose that in LGBTQ young adults, STB occurs through social processing and regulation of socially generated negative affect (e.g., shame). Specifically, we examine the distal vulnerability factors of sensitivity in social brain circuitry and negative urgency, or the tendency toward impulsive behavior in the face of painful negative affect, and the proximal, time-varying factors of sleep dysregulation and social experiences (e.g., rejection). The study will test the association of these distal and proximal factors with STB; differences in these factors between LGBTQ young adults with vs. without STB; the interplay of distal and proximal factors; and the role of LGBTQ-related characteristics (e.g., victimization, outness) in STB. The study will include 130 participants age 18-30, all of whom identify as LGBTQ and 2/3 of whom have recurrent suicidal ideation and lifetime history of suicidal behavior. Participants will complete a detailed interview of STB, an fMRI scan using social threat paradigms, a 3-month protocol of actigraphy and smartphone-based assessment, and a follow-up interview at 6 months. Smartphone data will include ecological momentary assessment of social threat experiences and STB, as well as passively collected sensor data (e.g., social media app use, texting activity). Traditional and machine learning quantitative techniques will be applied to determine contributions of distal and proximal factors to STB (e.g., occurrence of suicidal behavior), individual differences in risk factors, and contributions of neural, sleep, social, clinical, and demographic factors to STB. The study will elucidate the role of modifiable risk factors in STB and have relevance to clinical neuroscience, suicidology, and prevention efforts. Project Narrative Suicide in LGBTQ young adults has reached a crisis level, but our ability to predict and prevent suicide has not improved in 50 years. We will use brain imaging, actigraphy, and smartphone technology to measure critical social precipitants of suicidality and their interaction with general risk factors. With machine learning, a technique based on artificial intelligence, we will combine these sources of data to determine the way suicidal thoughts and behaviors develop over hours, days, and months.",Social-Affective Vulnerability to Suicidality among LGBTQ Young Adults: Proximal and Distal Factors,10106761,R01MH124900,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emergency Situation', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Face', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hotlines', 'Hour', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Same-sex', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Shame', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Victimization', 'Visit', 'actigraphy', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain circuitry', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'family support', 'follow-up', 'functional MRI scan', 'health disparity', 'longitudinal design', 'modifiable risk', 'negative affect', 'neuromechanism', 'queer', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'sleep quality', 'smartphone based assessment', 'social', 'social media', 'social model', 'social stigma', 'suicidal behavior', 'theories', 'trait', 'transgender', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,754061
"Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance Project Summary Social deficits are common in psychiatric disorders and available treatments are limited. Our lack of basic knowledge on how the brain controls social behaviors makes it challenging to develop therapeutics for social deficits. For numerous animal species, social rank dictates many aspects of behavior, such as access to resources and resilience to stress. Individuals with higher social rank typically win more often during social conflicts (e.g. food competition) and show more agonistic behaviors; collectivity referred to as dominance behaviors. Cross-species evidence suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an important role in social dominance. However, exactly how the mPFC encodes social rank and which mPFC inputs and outputs contribute to dominance behaviors is unknown. Multiple studies show that the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is necessary for social memory, and more recently, a study showed that this role involves vHPC input to the mPFC. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that the projection from the mPFC to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) modulates social dominance behavior. These findings in combination with the literature suggest a model in which the mPFC receives social memory information from the vHPC and guides social behaviors via modulation of LH GABAergic and glutamatergic subpopulations. Progress in uncovering neural correlates of social behavior has been limited by the tools used to characterize murine social behavior, since existing social assays lack trial- structure needed for statistical power and common measurements of social behavior are simplistic (e.g. sniffing). Overcoming this challenge required developing a trial-based social competition assay in which mice compete against cagemates for a reward signaled by a tone. Due to its trial structure, this assay facilitates the quantification of social behaviors and subsequently the identification of neural correlates for social dominance. In this assay, dominant mice win most of the rewards across trials, occupy the reward port and displace mice from the reward port more often than subordinates. Machine learning approaches will be used to profile the behavioral differences seen across social rank during the competition assay. Utilizing this ethologically relevant social competition assay, circuit manipulations, in vivo neural recording methods and machine learning allows testing the hypothesis that the tripartite vHPC-mPFC-LH circuit encodes social dominance. Altogether, this research will provide a new approach to study social dominance and will further our understanding of how the distributed circuits of the mPFC modulate social behavior. Furthermore, pinpointing the neural circuits underlying social behaviors will facilitate identification of potential therapeutics for social deficits in psychiatric disorders. Finally, completion of this research will provide training opportunities in statistical approaches for behavioral analysis and new circuit dissection tools, which are essential for the candidate to become an expert in social neuroscience and to start a successful independent research program. Project Narrative Social behavior deficits are key features of many psychiatric disorders, yet little is known about how the brain controls normal social behaviors. I propose to dissect the role of the medial prefrontal cortex circuits in social dominance by combining wireless electrophysiology, calcium imaging, optogenetics and machine learning. This study will broaden our understanding of how neural circuits control normal social behaviors and will contribute to the identification of novel interventions for social deficits.",Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance,10167793,K99MH124435,"['Affect', 'Agonistic Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Assay', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'cell cortex', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'mind control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'recruit', 'redshift', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'social competition', 'social deficits', 'social interventions', 'social neuroscience', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2021,123390
"Neural, computational and behavioral characterization of dynamic social behavior in borderline and avoidant personality disorder Project Summary Severe impairments in interpersonal functioning are hallmarks of personality disorders. Borderline personality disorder (BPD), for example, is characterized by inability to maintain relationships, inflexibility in dealing with changes in relationships, and heightened needs to control and manipulate others. Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), in contrast, is primarily marked by social withdrawal and avoidance, as well as reduced sense of control in social relationships. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models, particularly as applied to personality disorders. The overarching aim of this project is to utilize novel computational models and paradigms, combined with 7-Tesla imaging and brain connectivity measures, to capture the neural computations underlying proactive and dynamic social behaviors in BPD, AvPD, and healthy controls (HC; n=60 per group). Specifically, we will focus on two novel and complex social behaviors that mimic real-life social interaction: 1) social controllability, the ability to exert control over one’s social environment and, 2) social navigation, the process of navigating dynamically changing social relationships. In Aim 1, we will examine the computational and neural mechanisms of social controllability in BPD and AvPD using a social exchange paradigm in which participants either could or could not influence their partners’ monetary offers in a novel computational framework. We will capture key parameters such as estimated controllability (), sensitivity to norm violation (), and beliefs about control. In Aim 2, we will identify neurocomputational indices of dynamic social relationships in BPD and AvPD, using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters. We will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use state-of-the-art machine learning approaches and the neurocomputational parameters derived from Aims 1 & 2 to predict each participant’s diagnosis/group label (BPD, AvPD, or HC) and patients’ symptom severity. Upon successful completion of these aims, this project will provide important neurocomputational characterization for proactive social behaviors and how they might break down in BPD and AvPD, potentially breaking new grounds and filling critical knowledge gaps for social neuroscience and computational psychiatry research. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of personality and other psychiatric disorders. Thus, the proposed neurocomputational framework could parameterize social interactions, providing novel quantitative measures of social pathology, treatment change, and the nature of patient- psychotherapist interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both borderline and avoidant personality disorders are marked by profound impairments in interpersonal functioning. However, the brain mechanisms underlying these social deficits are not well understood. The goal of this project is to better elucidate how the brain is involved in complex social interactions and the clinical relevance of these processes for personality disorders.","Neural, computational and behavioral characterization of dynamic social behavior in borderline and avoidant personality disorder",10234509,R01MH123069,"['Assertiveness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Disorders', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Change', 'Social Controls', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer framework', 'geometric structure', 'indexing', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social relationships', 'social space', 'supervised learning', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,648979
"Modeling a Neural Circuit for Flexible Control of Innate Behaviors The adaptive control of social behaviors, such as aggression and reproduction, is a critical function of the nervous system. In the past decade, new methods for genetically targeted functional manipulation and imaging of neural activity have proven phenomenally fruitful in identifying neural subpopulations that play a role in expression of social behaviors. But our understanding of how these neural populations work together in a behaving animal remains highly fractured. In the proposed work, we develop a computational approach to integrate neural imaging data from multiple genetically targeted neural populations and construct a circuit model of social behavior control. A significant challenge in studying social behavior is its high variability and complexity, features that defy traditional trial-averaging-based analyses of neural activity. To address this challenge, we will leverage our recently developed automated tracking system to build a quantitative and detailed model of social behaviors and sensory processing in pairs of freely interacting mice. This behavior model will provide the basis for a thorough statistical analysis of neural dynamics within and between a collection of four subcortical nuclei, which together span three putative layers of processing, the first just past the sensory periphery and the last just upstream of premotor populations in the periaqueductal gray. This analysis will include 1) predicting animals' future behavior from joint neural and behavioral models, 2) characterizing behavior tuning of individual neurons in each nucleus with a linear-nonlinear model, and 3) fitting a network model to imaging data from multiple nuclei, and testing predicted connectivity from this model with a novel optogenetic perturbation system. Finally, we will build on these analyses to address the flexibility of behavior control by network models of subcortical nuclei. In the K99 phase, this research plan will allow me to develop advanced skills in the use of deep learning and recurrent neural networks for data analysis: skills that will be increasingly important as more labs start to study complex behaviors and meso-scale neural circuits. The strong computational environment at Caltech, including the labs of Pietro Perona, Markus Meister, and Doris Tsao, makes it an ideal place to develop my technical training, while the strength of the Anderson lab's experimental program provides a unique chance to collaborate closely with experimentalists in testing and refining models. Additional training in data presentation, teaching, grant-writing, and student mentorship will allow me to transition to an independent position. In the independent R00 phase, I will use these skills and the objectives of my remaining Aims to build a laboratory focused on the study of flexibility and behavioral adaptability in meso-scale neural circuits. Project Narrative This project investigates the network of densely interconnected brain areas that regulate complex social behavior in mammals. A tremendous number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, autism, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, impair or alter patients' social interactions and motivations. In this proposal, I use theory and modeling to bridge the gap from micro-level understanding of local brain activity to a meso-scale model of how brain areas act in concert to shape behavior, providing a tool to better understand mechanisms that disrupt their collective function.",Modeling a Neural Circuit for Flexible Control of Innate Behaviors,10269964,R00MH117264,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Housing', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dimensions', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Fracture', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Hunger', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instinct', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Medial', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurons', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preoptic Areas', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Controls', 'Social Interaction', 'Social status', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'generalized anxiety', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'multimodality', 'neglect', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R00,2021,244320
"Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory Project Summary / Abstract Ascertaining the neural basis of behavior has been a cornerstone goal since the conception of neurobiology. While activity recording and loss-of-function studies have shed light on brain regions involved and necessary for the expression of certain behaviors, they are unable to determine the information each circuit is responsible for encoding. Therefore, when different nodes in the circuit are removed, the behavioral phenotype is often identical. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change functional strength depending on experience, is considered the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Linking changes in the functional strength of synapses following behavior has begun to indicate what information circuits are responsible for encoding. To provide direct evidence, a tool that is able to modulate synaptic plasticity in specific circuit nodes during behavior is needed. The goal of this proposal is to create a photo-activatable inhibitor of presynaptic plasticity that will be input- and region- specific for use in behaving animals. The first aim of the proposal will create and screen constructs of photo-activatable PKI (paPKI) in their efficacy for the inhibition of protein kinase A, a kinase necessary for the induction of presynaptic plasticity. Light-dependency will be ensured and the construct will be evaluated based on its sensitivity and selectivity using advanced imaging techniques (2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging) and biochemical assays. The second aim of the proposal will use paPKI to determine the role of specific circuit nodes in social memory. Input-specific modulation of plasticity will be paired with in depth behavioral analyses using computer vision to parse out subtle differences in social interaction. These aims directly address the BRAIN Initiative 2025 high priority goal #4: the modulation of neural activity with readouts of behavior using advanced computer vision techniques. The proposed fellowship project provides excellent training potential as it expands from the applicant’s current training in systems/circuit neuroscience to molecular and biophysical neuroscience. The project is an intersection between the mentor’s, Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, expertise in molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and the development and advanced imaging of biomodulators and sensors, and the applicant’s expertise in circuitry underlying social memory, electrophysiology and behavioral analyses using computer vision. The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is an intensely collaborative environment filled with leaders in the field and exceptional resources, resulting in an institute that is highly productive and influential. This fellowship proposal presents excellent training potential and aims to produce tools that will advance the field. Project Narrative While the ability to discern an appropriate behavioral response during social encounters is of quintessential importance in communally living animals, the neural circuitry storing social memories that guide this behavioral choice are poorly understood. Here, we will harness and develop novel molecular tools to manipulate synaptic plasticity in an input-specific manner to discern the specific role of each node in a social memory circuit. Additionally, the tools developed in this proposal will be applicable to studies discerning the neural circuitry underlying other forms of learning and memory facilitating greater understanding of neural computations underlying behavior and how these may be altered in neuropsychiatric diseases.",Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory,10163915,F32MH120872,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Assessment tool', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain region', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conceptions', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Hela Cells', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Protein Kinase A Inhibitor', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral response', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'commune', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'link protein', 'loss of function', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'optical fiber', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'social learning', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MAX PLANCK FLORIDA CORPORATION,F32,2021,73562
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group. This has clear implications for identifying those at risk for autism and for ongoing clinical care.",Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development,10188635,R01MH114999,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Client', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical care', 'common treatment', 'communication behavior', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'efficacious treatment', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovative technologies', 'joint attention', 'language outcome', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,333604
"Mechanisms for internally and externally guided sensorimotor learning PROJECT SUMMARY Expressive social behaviors, including speech and music, are culturally transmitted from a tutor to a pupil. Such learning depends on a pupil’s ability to integrate social and sensory cues provided by a tutor performing the relevant behavior. Once learned, the underlying motor program must be coordinated with a range of innate motor programs to generate holistic behaviors necessary to effective social signaling. The central hypothesis that this proposal seeks to test is that the same brain circuitry that enables the pupil to integrate social and sensory cues from an adult tutor also function in the adult to enable integration of the learned and innate programs necessary to effective social signaling. In the past cycle, we discovered where neural signals encoding social and sensory cues provided by a tutor are integrated in the pupil’s brain. Specifically, we showed that neurons in a midbrain dopamine cell group (A11) in a juvenile songbird are selectively excited during interactions with a singing adult male tutor, and that pairing song playback with the optogenetically- triggered release of dopamine from A11 terminals in a sensorimotor cortical analogue (HVC) is sufficient to drive song copying. Despite these important insights, exactly when and how tutor experience transforms auditory and motor coding in HVC to facilitate vocal learning remains unknown. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will use multiphoton (2p) longitudinal imaging, fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that tutor experience rapidly strengthens the auditory and motor network in the pupil’s HVC. We will also use novel machine learning tools for vocal analysis and optogenetic methods to test the idea that these sensorimotor changes enable HVC to enhance the acoustic complexity of the pupil’s song, a first step in vocal copying. Our prior studies support the idea that social and auditory cues provided by the tutor drive coincident DA release and auditory synaptic activity in the pupil’s HVC, rapidly potentiating sensorimotor synapses in this region. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will use ex vivo channelrhodopsin circuit-mapping to test the hypothesis that coincident DA release and auditory synaptic actvity rapidly potentiates auditory synapses onto HVC interneurons, and that these effects are strongest during juvenile sensitive periods for learning. Notably, the courtship display of the adult songbird includes a learned song that is seamlessly coordinated with a variety of innate behaviors, including female- directed calling, orientation, and pursuit. In Preliminary Studies, we found that lesions of A11’s axon terminals in HVC of the adult male finch abolish female-directed singing without affecting his innate courtship behaviors. In contrast, selectively ablating A11 cell bodies abolished all of the male’s courtship behaviors. In Aim 3, we will map, monitor and manipulate A11’s projections to HVC and other motor centers to test the idea that A11 acts as a central hub to enable the seamless and rapid coordination of learned and innate motor programs in response to social cues provided by a nearby female. PROJECT NARRATIVE Social learning is the foundation for speech, music and athletics but full mastery of these complex behaviors requires the fluent coordination of learned and innate motor programs. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that a neural circuit comprising a midbrain dopamine cell group and its cortical and subcortical projections is crucial to social learning and the coordination of learned and innate motor programs.",Mechanisms for internally and externally guided sensorimotor learning,10305438,R01NS099288,"['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Auditory', 'Bathing', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Courtship', 'Cues', 'Dopamine', 'Emotional', 'Facial Expression', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Finches', 'Foundations', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Influentials', 'Instinct', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Music', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Photometry', 'Preparation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosencephalon', 'Pupil', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'analog', 'brain circuitry', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'insight', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'molecular phenotype', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'social', 'social learning', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tutoring', 'vocal learning', 'zebra finch']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,354988
"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,10153459,R01HD092331,"['Academia', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Crime', 'Criminology', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Family', 'Firearms', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Security', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'behavioral outcome', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'convict', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'developmental psychology', 'efficacious treatment', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'repeat offender', 'social', 'social factors', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2021,692058
"Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis Understanding the function of the nervous system requires a sophisticated understanding of its main output, behavior. Although our ability to record from and to manipulate neurons and neural circuits has accelerated at a spectacular pace over the last decade, progress has lagged in coupling the interrogation of the nervous system to similarly high-resolution measures of behavior. As a consequence, we lack a sophisticated understanding of how the brain composes, modifies and controls action.  We have recently developed a transformative behavioral characterization technology called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), which circumvents many of the limitations imposed by typical approaches to behavioral measurement (e.g., overtraining, head-fixation, limited behavioral flexibility). This analytical system works by capturing comprehensive and continuous morphometric data about the three-dimensional (3D) posture of a mouse as it freely behaves. The 3D data are then analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify patterns of motion that correspond to stereotyped and reused modules of sub-second behavior (which by analogy to natural language we refer to as behavioral “syllables”). The output of this fitting procedure is a parts list for behavior: a limited set of syllables out of which the rodent creates all of its observable action. In addition, within any given experiment MoSeq identifies the specific transition structure (or “grammar”) that places individual syllables into sequences; these sequences encode all patterns of spontaneous behavior expressed by an animal in a given experimental context. We have recently combined this behavioral assessment technology with techniques for neural recording, allowing us to assess the relationship between neural activity in behaviorally-relevant circuits and patterns of action. This combined approach allowed us, for example, to identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics in striatum; importantly, these observed correlations validate MoSeq as a technology that enables accurate inference of internal states from external states. However, the code that underlies MoSeq is essentially bespoke, inappropriate for distribution, and difficult for all but expert users to navigate. In addition, implementing MoSeq in its current form requires extensive prior mathematical and computational experience, limiting its use to a small set of users with specialized skills. Here we propose Aims to democratize MoSeq by (1) transforming it into an end-to-end pipeline that can be easily used by graduate-student level neuroscientists with minimal expertise, and which can be modified on an ongoing basis to accommodate improvements to MoSeq and (2) to offer hands-on training in the set-up and appropriate use of MoSeq for characterizing behavior and neural-behavioral relationships. Together these aims will create a vibrant community of MoSeq users; the creation of such a group has the potential to transform the way behavior is analyzed across neuroscience, and promises to lead to broad insights into the many and varied relationships between neural circuits and behavior. A central goal of neurobiology is to reveal how the brain generates and organizes action, but we lack sophisticated tools for objectively and comprehensively characterizing behavior. We have developed a next- generation method called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) that affords unprecedented insight into how the brain organizes behavior; however, using this approach requires substantial expertise, which has slowed its adoption by the scientific community. Here we propose to streamline and package the underlying code, and to offer hands-on training, so that users without extensive computer science or math backgrounds can easily use MoSeq to characterize animal behavior as part of efforts to understand how genes, drugs or neural activity changes action.","Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis",9902565,U24NS109520,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Educational workshop', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'data format', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'graphical user interface', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'natural language', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'next generation', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'skills', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'voltage', 'web services']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U24,2021,466672

"Primed to (re)act: Can changes in procedural language prevent adverse events between police and minority male youth? PROJECT SUMMARY While researchers continue to study the effects of disproportionate minority contact with law enforcement on a range of health-related outcomes, a recent review of this work questions the methodological validity of most studies on this topic. Many of these concerns focus on (a) unrealistic assumptions about police behavior and (b) poor quality data. This project addresses both by introducing a human development based model of law enforcement officer (LEO) behavior and applying this model to study how LEOs identify with male minority youth (MMY) using a novel publicly available data source: broadcast police communications (BPC). Our long-term goals are (1) to assess the viability of BPC for understanding how LEOs perceive MMY both “in the moment” via the pre-reflective procedural language used before and during LEO-MMY encounters and “at rest” via development of a survey instrument measuring LEO identification with minority youth, and (2) to determine if BPC may be used in lieu of non-public data sources to study police behavior by developing a novel computational strategy for extracting meaningful information from BPC via, among other strategies, a first-of-its-kind automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and large scale (>100 hours) training corpus of transcribed BPC for use by computational social scientists and ASR researchers. Our previous research revealed that a complex set of psychosocial mechanisms govern the developmental trajectories of MMYs, indicating MMYs adopt reactive coping strategies to particular stressful events (e.g. encounters with police) that can be maladaptive (e.g. hypermasculinity) depending on context of interactions. Our work also suggests that all humans are subject to similar processes. Since the outcomes of LEO-MMY encounters are ultimately the responsibility of LEOs, this project seeks to improve the quality of these encounters (i.e. reduce youth trauma) by studying a little acknowledged LEO reactive coping strategy: the character of procedural language used to provide LEOs with incident-specific information via BPC. This conceptual approach derives from our theoretical framing (i.e. Spencer’s phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory, or PVEST) that highlights the development and utilization of reactive coping strategies in response—particularly—to MMY associated stress. It is our premise that BPC can prime LEOs to inaccurately interpret the behavior of MMY as threatening, increasing the potential for adverse events. Such inaccurate assessments are hard to combat since LEOs are acting on the best information available. As a result, the procedural language of BPC pose unacknowledged risks to the well- being of MMY. This study will thus perform a first-of-its-kind analysis of BPC to simultaneously assess its viability for determining racial discrimination in policing and develop a novel survey instrument measuring LEOs ability to identify with MMY for use by researchers and policing organizations across the country. Public Health Relevance / Project Narrative Across the United States, adverse events involving law enforcement officers (LEOs) and male minority youth (MMY) and the toxic stress associated with repeated negative LEO-MMY encounters raise compelling public health concerns about racial discrimination in policing. The proposed research addresses these concerns by (a) introducing a novel human development paradigm for the study of police behavior that focuses on how and to what extent LEOs identify with MMY and (b) assessing the technological viability of using broadcast police communications (BPC) for large scale analysis of police behavior, where BPC are analyzed as pre-reflective accounts of LEO thought processes, representing both reactive and stable coping mechanisms (i.e., speech acts) for ensuring the safety of LEOs and the public at large. Accordingly, we propose (1) using this novel data source to understand how LEOs and MMYs come to perceive each other, (2) test a similarly novel survey instrument for measuring LEO identification with minority youth, in the process determining how much meaningful information can be reliably extracted from audio recordings of BPC for identifying racial discrimination in policing without the need to access highly sensitive police records or video recording data.",Primed to (re)act: Can changes in procedural language prevent adverse events between police and minority male youth?,10121621,R01MD015064,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Affective', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Chicago', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Police', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Stressful Event', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trust', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'Youth', 'acronyms', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'combat', 'coping', 'coping mechanism', 'course development', 'data quality', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'lens', 'male', 'member', 'novel', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial discrimination', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'social']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,744667
