"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE: HERCULES Human health and disease is dictated by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The HERCULES Center is focused on providing a more comprehensive assessment of these environmental influences by utilizing exposome-based concepts and approaches.",HERCULES: Exposome Research Center,10144435,P30ES019776,"['Achievement', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Science Core', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Leadership', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Toxicology', 'Translations', 'Update', 'Vision', 'base', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'health science research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'operation', 'ranpirnase', 'treatment strategy']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,P30,2021,1471985
"Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic PROJECT SUMMARY Up-to-date information about non-fatal overdose emergency department (ED) encounters can provide critical information about the evolution of the opioid epidemic and response of the healthcare system and is an essential to planning of clinical trials to address the problems underlying this epidemic. Establishing a platform that delivers high positive predictive value for opioid-related overdose (OD) using a combination of coded and natural language terms in electronic health records (EHRs) is an essential step toward the large-scale surveillance necessary to evaluate the pragmatic effectiveness of numerous systemic and policy-based efforts and to create the infrastructure for large scale trials to reduce drug-related mortality and morbidity. However, to date, localized and federal efforts have been largely based on discrete ICD-10 code data or have had time lags of one-to-three years for more detailed data. Perhaps more Importantly, they have not had the capacity for planning and feasibility assessment for clinical and translational research at specific sites. We propose foundational work to create an inter-institutional research database and network focused on patients presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD. To create this network, we will extend previous work to develop: (1) an e-phenotype for case identification in the ED based on EHR data, and (2) combine this with a data dictionary and coded data extraction tools, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, to obtain additional data from EHRs; tools for primary capture of data during clinical care; and tools for integration of data on social determinants of health. This will allow for a more thorough characterization of individuals presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD including: demographics, comorbidities, OD agent and source, intentionality of the OD, ED treatment and discharge disposition. Through refinement and automation, the data extraction process will be extended to a set of pilot CTSA Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) Network sites and then potentially to other CTSA's nation-wide. This new functionality focuses on providing a platform to accelerate research. To accomplish this work, our Specific Aims are to: 1) Demonstrate the feasibility of extending the ACT Network data model and infrastructure to monitor the opioid epidemic using ED data, 2) Create a prototype opioid overdose monitoring and response network across participating institutions and a toolkit for other CTSA sites to join the network, and 3) Demonstrate potential usefulness of the network in monitoring the opioid epidemic and in planning clinical trials. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective near real time means of monitoring opioid-related OD presentation in EDs across the country to inform point-of-care service delivery, prevention and treatment intervention development and evaluation. Downstream, the application of project deliverables include dissemination of the replication toolkit to leverage the platform of the CTSAs and NIDA Clinical Trials Network to build capacity for timely surveillance of opioid-related OD to facilitate prevention and treatment research and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients presenting with opioid-related overdose to hospital emergency departments represent a high-risk group for morbidity and mortality and a potential target for interventions to combat the opioid epidemic. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective inter-institutional research database and network focused on these patients. These tools will inform point-of-care service delivery, as well as enhance nationwide prevention and treatment interventions.",Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic,10198067,U01TR002628,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'California', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fentanyl', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Resources', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heroin', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investments', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratories', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Prescription Drugs', 'Odds Ratio', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome Study', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Research', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Site', 'Source', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical infrastructure', 'combat', 'comorbidity', 'data dictionary', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data tools', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electronic data', 'fitness', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose prevention', 'point of care', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prototype', 'response', 'service delivery', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'synthetic opioid', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational study', 'treatment research']",NCATS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,U01,2021,724111
"ARAGORN: Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation Of Ranked Networks We propose an Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation of Ranked Networks (ARAGORN), which will query Knowledge Providers (KPs) and synthesize answers relevant to user-specified questions, building upon algorithms and components developed as part of the ROBOKOP [1,2] application during the feasibility phase of Translator. The ARAGORN services represent the next generation of ROBOKOP component services, iterating and innovating in response to challenges exposed in the Translator feasibility phase. Based on that work, we have identified overarching issues that must be addressed to truly unleash the power of Translator. 1. ARAs must be able to operate in a federated knowledge environment effectively and efficiently. First-generation Translator tools assembled full data sets from which to extract answers, which were subsequently ranked. Second-generation tools must be able to efficiently operate on massive, distributed data, demanding a new approach. ARAGORN will act asynchronously, interleaving KP queries with partial scoring of answers, prioritizing search directions on-the-fly, and delivering early results that are updated over time in response to newly explored paths 2. ARAs must bridge the precision mismatch between data representations and algorithms that require specificity, and users who pose questions and prefer answers at a more abstract level. Biomedical scientists do not pose questions as database queries. Furthermore, even expert users of current biomedical databases such as ROBOKOP KG or RTX require exploration and experimentation to craft queries to express their intent. ARAGORN will employ multiple strategies to remove this barrier to asking questions effectively, from basic maintenance of a question library, to node generalization, query rewriting, and machine learning techniques such as capsule graph networks. ARAGORN will further use elements of specific answers to create gestalt explanations, clustering, and combining answers with similar content, revealing the commonalities and contradictions in answers. 3. ARAs must be able to generalize answer ranking to address a broader range of question formulations and data types, and to account for counterevidence. In the Translator implementation phase, we anticipate having access to many varied KPs and ARAs that provide diverse quantitative metadata regarding the confidence in assertions or strength of associations. There will be a pressing need to synthesize such data into scores for arbitrarily-shaped answer graphs, in order to filter and prioritize answers for further analysis or user digestion. ARAGORN will address this need by providing a novel scoring algorithm capable of (a) scoring arbitrary directed multi-hypergraphs, (b) accounting for heterogeneous quantitative metadata; and (c) leveraging relationship polarity to incorporate counterevidence. ARAGORN will provide access to this functionality, and connect to KPs using community-defined APIs and data models. The ARAGORN team has contributed to these community efforts during the Translator feasibility phase, and if funded will continue to work with the Standards and Reference Implementations (SRI) group, NCATS staff, and other awardees to continue to define and refine methods and models for data sharing and collaboration. The ARAGORN services will be created with collaboration in mind, such that they can be plugged into larger pipelining and architectural efforts. Most of the risks to the ARAGORN strategy are shared by the entire program; as standardization evolves, the ARAGORN team and other members of the Translator consortium will be required to spend effort updating components. ARAGORN will require access to ontology and similarity tools that we anticipate will be provided by KPs or shared infrastructure; if these do not materialize, the ARAGORN team will create the tools that it needs to accomplish its goals. Additionally, we are assuming the existence of fully translator-compliant KPs from which to draw data; if the program collectively decides that compliance is enforced in ARAs instead, we will draw on our work in ROBOKOP to implement the necessary normalization components in ARAGORN. n/a",ARAGORN: Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation Of Ranked Networks,10332268,OT2TR003441,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Digestion', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Phase', 'Provider', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'arbitrary spin', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'capsule', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'database query', 'distributed data', 'innovation', 'member', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'tool']",NCATS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,OT2,2021,1052712
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10204729,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data repository', 'experience', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,639861
"DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets Component type: This Knowledge Provider project will continue and significantly extend work done by the Translator Consortium Blue Team, focusing on deriving knowledge from real-world data through complex analytic workflows, integrated to the Translator Knowledge Graph, and served via tools like Big GIM and the Translator Standard API. The problem: We aim to solve the “first mile” problem of translational research: how to integrate the multitude of dynamic small-to-large data sets that have been produced by the research and clinical communities, but that are in different locations, processed in different ways, and in a variety of formats that may not be mutually interoperable. Integrating these data sets requires significant manual work downloading, reformatting, parsing, indexing and analyzing each data set in turn. The technical and ethical challenges of accessing diverse collections of big data, efficiently selecting information relevant to different users’ interests, and extracting the underlying knowledge are problems that remain unsolved. Here, we propose to leverage lessons distilled from our previous and ongoing big data analysis projects to develop a highly automated tool for removing these bottlenecks, enabling researchers to analyze and integrate many valuable data sets with ease and efficiency, and making the data FAIR [1]. Plan: (AIM 1) We will analyze and extract knowledge from rich real-world biomedical data sets (listed in the Resources page) in the domains of wellness, cancer, and large-scale clinical records. (AIM 2) We will formalize methods from Aim 1 to develop DOCKET, a novel tool for onboarding and integrating data from multiple domains. (AIM 3) We will work with other teams to adapt DOCKET to additional knowledge domains. ■ The DOCKET tool will offer 3 modules: (1) DOCKET Overview: Analysis of, and knowledge extraction from, an individual data set. (2) DOCKET Compare: Comparing versions of the same data set to compute confidence values, and comparing different data sets to find commonalities. (3) DOCKET Integrate: Deriving knowledge through integrating different data sets. ■ Researchers will be able to parameterize these functions, resolve inconsistencies, and derive knowledge through the command line, Jupyter notebooks, or other interfaces as specified by Translator Standards. ■ The outcome will be a collection of nodes and edges, richly annotated with context, provenance and confidence levels, ready for incorporation into the Translator Knowledge Graph (TKG). ■ All analyses and derived knowledge will be stored in standardized formats, enabling querying through the Reasoner Std API and ingestion into downstream AI assisted machine learning. ■ Example questions this will allow us to address include: (Wellness) Which clinical analytes, metabolites, proteins, microbiome taxa, etc. are significantly correlated, and which changing analytes predict transition to which disease? [2,3] (Cancer) Which gene mutations in any of X pathways are associated with sensitivity or resistance to any of Y drugs, in cell lines from Z tumor types? (All data sets) Which data set entities are similar to this one? Are there significant clusters? What distinguishes between the clusters? What significant correlations of attributes can be observed? How can this set of entities be expanded by adding similar ones? How do these N versions of this data set differ, and how stable is each knowledge edge as the data set changes over time? Collaboration strengths: Our team has extensive experience with biomedical and domain-agnostic data analytics, integrating multiple relevant data types: omics, clinical measurements and electronic health records (EHRs). We have participated in large collaborative consortia and have subject matter experts willing to advise on proper data interpretation. Our application synergizes with those of other Translator teams (see Letters of Collaboration). Challenges: Data can come in a bewildering diversity of formats. Our solution will be modular, will address the most common formats first, and will leverage established technologies like DataFrames and importers (like pandas.io) where possible. Mapping nodes and edge types onto standard ontologies is crucial for knowledge integration; we will collaborate with the Standards component to maximize success. n/a",DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets,10330627,OT2TR003443,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'FAIR principles', 'Gene Mutation', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'experience', 'indexing', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge integration', 'large datasets', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT2,2021,332969
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,10194459,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-aphasic', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2021,39939
"ICEES+ Knowledge Provider: Leveraging Open Clinical and Environmental Data to Accelerate and Drive Innovation in Translational Research and Clinical Care. As part of the feasibility phase of the Translator program, we have developed a disease-agnostic framework and approach for openly exposing clinical data that have been integrated at the patient- and visit-level with environmental exposures data: the Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service (ICEES). We have validated ICEES and demonstrated the service’s ability to replicate and extend published findings on asthma, while also supporting open team science, accelerated translational discovery, and integration with the broader Translator ecosystem. This proposal aims to move ICEES from prototype to development via creation of an ICEES+ Knowledge Provider (KP). Specifically, we aim to address three major challenges that we have identified through research and development (R&D) of the prototype ICEES in an effort to improve the quality, value, and impact of query answers and assertions. Specific Aim 1. Advance the rigor of insights and assertions that ICEES provides. Our prototype ICEES currently provides the ability to dynamically define cohorts and conduct simple statistical associations to examine bivariate relationships between feature variables. Recently, we have identified an approach to extend the bivariate functionalities to support multivariate analysis of the data. For the proposed work, we will apply multivariate analyses, including traditional statistical methods (e.g., regression models) and machine learning methods (e.g., bayesian neural network models, variational autoencoder models), and systematically quantify the extent of data loss and analytic bounds when algorithms are imposed on the ICEES+ KP open application programming interface (API) versus the Institutional Review Board (IRB)– protected, fully identified, pre-binned, underlying integrated feature tables. The overall goal is to provide users with more rigorous insights and estimates of the robustness, validity, accuracy, and specificity of knowledge and assertions generated via the ICEES+ KP OpenAPI. Specific Aim 2. Address issues related to space–time and causality. Clinical and environmental data are inherently spatiotemporal, with observations or events that are contingent on space and time and may be causally related. For the proposed work, we will evaluate and implement technical approaches (e.g., ICEES+ design modifications), spatiotemporal statistical algorithms (e.g., conditional auto-regression), recurrent neural network models, and causal inference models. As part of this effort, we will derive insights from and contribute real-world evidence to support Causal Activity Models and Adverse Outcome Pathways. We also will explore approaches for incorporating into ICEES+ nationwide public data on school exposures—data that will allow us to begin to address patient mobility. Specific Aim 3. Evaluate the security of the ICEES+ KP to ensure that patient privacy is preserved as new capabilities are enabled. ImPACT is an NSF-funded package of tools and services that provides end-to-end infrastructure and support for privacy-assured research and computation on sensitive data. Over the award period, we will implement and evaluate ImPACT security protocols, focusing initially on application of the ImPACT secure multiparty computation (SMC) algorithm as a method to support secure multi-institutional sharing of data on rare diseases and events—a functionality that is not currently supported by ICEES. In addition, we will evaluate other ImPACT security protocols, working under the guidance of a security advisor and in the context of driving use cases and capabilities developed under Specific Aims1 and 2. Importantly, the project aims will be driven by three use cases and associated high-value queries designed to complement and extend our asthma-focused work on the prototype ICEES: (1) an asthma cohort from the Environmental Polymorphism Registry (EPR) at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS); (2) a primary ciliary disease cohort (PCD) from the UNC PCD Registry; and (3) a drug-induced liver injury (DILI) cohort from the National DILI Network. These use cases will invoke new diseases, new data types, new organ systems, new institutions, and new queries, thereby stress-testing the ICEES framework and approach and moving it from prototype to development as the ICEES+ KP. n/a",ICEES+ Knowledge Provider: Leveraging Open Clinical and Environmental Data to Accelerate and Drive Innovation in Translational Research and Clinical Care.,10333478,OT2TR003430,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Bayesian neural network', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress Tests', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'application programming interface', 'autoencoder', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'liver injury', 'machine learning method', 'patient mobility', 'patient privacy', 'preservation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NCATS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,OT2,2021,982187
"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools. The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) was first implemented to enable large scale computational modeling of brain cells and circuits used to study neural function in health and disease. This new project extends NSG's utility to support development, dissemination and use of new tools by the neuroscience community for analyzing enormous data sets produced by advanced experimental methods in neuroscience.",Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software.,10186744,U24EB029005,"['Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain cell', 'collaborative environment', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'image processing', 'interest', 'models and simulation', 'open data', 'operation', 'outreach program', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trend', 'webinar']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2021,377473
"Carolina Population Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Carolina Population Center requests infrastructure support that will advance population dynamics research at CPC by increasing research impact, innovation, and productivity, supporting the development of junior scientists, and reducing the administrative burden on scientists. Infrastructure support will advance science in three primary research areas: Sexuality, Reproduction, Fertility, and Families; Population, Health, and the Environment; and Inequality, Mobility, Disparities, and Well-Being. Much of the research at CPC draws on large publicly available longitudinal data sets that our faculty have designed and collected, including the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the China Health and Nutrition Survey, newer surveys associated with the Transfer Project, and the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, all of which will continue to be important in work related to our primary research areas over the next five years. These projects embody several themes that have guided research at CPC since the Center's inception. These themes, which will continue to shape our work, are the importance of life course processes and longitudinal data, multi-level processes and measurement of context, interventions and natural experiments as means of learning about causal processes, and the relevance of sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, race- ethnicity, and socioeconomic status for disparities in health and well-being. By embedding these themes, our projects provide data that enable us to address barriers that otherwise impede progress in the population sciences generally, and in our primary research areas in particular. We request support for three cores which in combination will provide an institutional infrastructure that will push populations dynamics research forward by empowering CPC faculty to tackle challenging questions using state of the art measurement techniques and methods. The Administrative Core plans activities that maintain a stimulating intellectual community, streamlines administrative processes so that scientists can focus on research, coordinates activities of the Cores so that services are offered efficiently, and communicates information about research and data more broadly. The Development Core supports early stage investigators and other faculty with exciting new ideas through multiple mechanisms: workshops, access to technical expertise in measurement, and seed grants. The Research Services Core enables scientists to address complex and important population research issues by providing access to state-of-the-art research tools and professional support for programming, survey development, and analysis. NARRATIVE This project will provide infrastructure support for a cutting edge program of research on population dynamics at the Carolina Population Center. Research at the Center will analyze state-of-the art data to address fundamental questions regarding fertility, adolescent health, and links between the environment and health.

"A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research Summary/Abstract This project will construct a Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (IPUMS-MLP) of unprecedented scale and scope. Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,10174657,R01AG057679,"['Adult', 'Aging', 'Big Data', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Demographic Transitions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Genealogy', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immigration', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Mission', 'Names', 'Neighborhoods', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Process', 'Public Policy', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Social Processes', 'Social Security', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Urbanization', 'War', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive capacity', 'cost effective', 'data curation', 'data integration', 'data quality', 'economic outcome', 'experience', 'health economics', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'lead exposure', 'life history', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,672964
"University of Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute Contact PD/PI: Murphy, Timothy F The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years. A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation. We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region, opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in 2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium; 2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively contribute to the national consortium.

"Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Researchers are increasingly working to “mine” health data to derive new medical knowledge. Unlike experimental data that are collected per a research protocol, the primary role of clinical data is to help clinicians care for patients, so the procedures for its collection are not often systematic. Thus, missing and/or biased data can hinder medical knowledge discovery and data mining efforts. Existing efforts for missing health data imputation often focus on only cross-sectional correlation (e.g., correlation across subjects or across variables) but neglect autocorrelation (e.g., correlation across time points). Moreover, they often focus on modeling incompleteness but neglect the biases in health data. Modeling both the incompleteness and bias may contribute to better understanding of health data and better support clinical decision making. We propose a novel framework of Bias-Aware Missing data Imputation with Cross-sectional correlation and Autocorrelation (BAMICA), and leverage clinical notes to better inform the methods that will otherwise rely on structured health data only. In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets. Aim 1 introduces the MICA framework to jointly consider cross-sectional correlation and auto-correlation. In Aim 2, we will augment MICA to be bias-aware (hence BAMICA) to account for biases stemmed from multiple roots such as healthcare process and use them as features in imputing missing health data. This augmentation is achieved by a novel recurrent neural network architecture that keeps track of both evolution of health data variables and bias factors. In Aim 3, we will supplement unstructured clinical notes to structured health data for modeling incompleteness and biases using a novel architecture of graph neural network on top of memory network. We will apply graph neural networks to process clinical notes in order to learn proper representations as input to the memory networks for imputation and downstream predictive modeling tasks. Depending on the clinical problem and data availability, not all modules may be needed. Thus our proposed BAMICA framework is designed to be flexible and consists of selectable modules to meet some or all of the above needs. In summary, our proposal bridges a key knowledge gap in jointly modeling incompleteness and biases in health data and utilizes unstructured clinical notes to supplement and augment such modeling in order to better support predictive modeling and clinical decision making. We will demonstrate generalizability by experimenting on four large clinical and cohort study datasets, and by scaling up to the eMERGE network spanning 11 institutions nationwide. We will disseminate the open-source framework. The principled and flexible framework generated by this project will bring significant methodological advancement and have a direct impact on enhancing discovery from health data. Researchers are increasingly working to “mine” health data to derive new medical knowledge. Unlike experimental data that are collected per a research protocol, the primary role of clinical data is to help clinicians care for patients, so the procedures for its collection are not often systematic. Thus, missing and/or biased data can hinder medical knowledge discovery and data mining efforts. We propose a novel framework of Bias-Aware Missing data Imputation with Cross-sectional correlation and Autocorrelation (BAMICA), and leverage clinical notes to better inform the methods that will otherwise rely on structured health data only. In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets.",Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data,10168611,R01LM013337,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'lifetime risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neglect', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized therapeutic', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'scale up', 'social health determinants', 'stem', 'structured data', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,315727
"National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Project summary/abstract NACC (as U01 AG016976, at University of Washington) has been active since 1999. The existing NACC infrastructure is described in the Facilities and Resources Section of this application. The broad goals of the past funding cycles are consistent with those of the current U24 RFA — that is, to serve as: a.) the central hub for organizing and enabling communication within and outside of the ADRC program, including annual meetings and steering committees; b.) a national data resource, collecting data from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) as well as affiliated data and sample repositories; and c.) a facilitator of current and future AD/ADRD research. NACC has considerable experience and success in reaching these goals, and is positioned for continued success in a rapidly advancing field. New data and methods are appearing in areas such as biomarkers, neuropathology, and tests for early detection. Through the strategic adoption of technological advances, we will build on these accomplishments at an accelerated pace. Building on our already significant capabilities, we will: promote and broaden communication within and outside of the ADRC program; expand informatics capabilities of NACC consistent with FAIR principles; conduct and support methodologic and applied research, leveraging deep expertise in biostatistics and data science; and support early-career research scientists by providing peer-reviewed competitive funding for several “junior investigators” each year. We aim to continue to improve our approach in each arena by combining time-tested approaches with the new tools and innovations we are developing to meet the changing scientific, technological, and communication needs of the NIA ADRC program and the field. Narrative NACC (as U01 AG016976, at University of Washington — now seeking renewal as a U24) has been active since 1999, and has established a standardized, longitudinal clinical database of over 42,000 individuals (with neuropathology data on over 6,100), as well as cross-sectional, retrospective data on roughly 66,000 individuals seen at ADRCs between 1984 and 2005. NACC has made these data freely available to researchers worldwide, resulting in hundreds of publications. We will modernize and intensify our informatics approach, making data access and use more efficient; will grow communication and coordination capabilities with the ADRCs and collaborating NIA projects; will develop and apply big-data research tools for the field; and will provide competitive, peer-reviewed research support for several new investigators each year. Together with the field’s leaders, NACC will innovate, develop, and drive solutions to meet the changing needs of the field as well as the NIA ADRC program.",National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center,10204491,U24AG072122,"['Achievement', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Peer Review', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Peer Review', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'career', 'clinical database', 'clinical examination', 'cohort', 'community center', 'data access', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'disease heterogeneity', 'e-science', 'experience', 'high standard', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'programs', 'repository', 'social media', 'success', 'tool', 'translational health science', 'trend', 'web site']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U24,2021,6979612
"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years.

"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt,10229591,P50HD103537,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Affect', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Down Syndrome', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Research', 'Prevention', 'Problem behavior', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical translation', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug-induced weight gain', 'experience', 'image processing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'translational neuroscience', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2021,1364066
"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text Project Summary / Abstract The current proposal continues the investigation on the topic of temporal relation extraction from the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative funded by the NLM since 2010 (Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events, or THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org). Through our efforts so far, we have defined the topic as an active area of research attracting attention across the world. Since its inception, the project has pushed the boundaries of this highly challenging task by investigating new computational methods within the context of the latest developments in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical informatics (BMI) resulting in 60+ publications/presentations. We have made our best performing methods available to the community open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES; ctakes.apache.org). In 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we organized an international shared task (Clinical TempEval) on the topic under the umbrella of the highly prestigious SemEval, thus inviting the international community to work with our THYME data and improve on our results. Clinical TempEval has been highly successful with many participants each year, resulting in new discoveries and many publications. We have made all our data along with our gold standard annotations available to the community through the hNLP Center (center.healthnlp.org).  The underlying theme of this renewal is novel methods for combining explicit domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical), readily available unlabeled data (health-related social media, EMRs), and modern machine learning techniques (e.g. neural networks) for temporal relation extraction from the EMR clinical narrative. Therefore, our renewal proposes a novel and much needed exploration of this line of research:  Specific Aim 1: Develop computational models for novel rich semantic representations such as the Abstract Meaning Representations to encapsulate a single, coherent, full-document graphical representation of meaning for temporal relation extraction  Specific Aim 2: Develop computational methods to infuse domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical) into modern machine learning techniques such as NNs for temporal relation extraction – through input representations, pre-trained vectors, or architectures  Specific Aim 3: Develop novel methods for combining labeled and unlabeled data from various sources (EMR, health-related social media, newswire) for temporal relation extraction from the clinical narrative  Specific Aim 4: Apply the best performing methods for temporal relation extraction developed in SA1-3 to temporally sensitive phenotypes for direct translational sciences studies. Dissemination efforts through publications and open source releases into Apache cTAKES. Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles. The goal of our current proposal is to automatically discover temporal relations from clinical free text and structured EMR data and create an aggregated patient-level timeline.",Temporal relation discovery for clinical text,10176589,R01LM010090,"['Address', 'Apache', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Image', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thyme', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vision', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'cohesion', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning community', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social media', 'support vector machine', 'symptom treatment', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,531398
"CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare Project Summary Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis. Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud- based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1) improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical/translational research. Project Narrative In this study, we plan to develop a new clinical natural language processing (NLP) tool based on the existing widely used CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing) system, to support enterprise development and deployment of NLP solutions in healthcare. We believe that the new generation of Cloud- based, service-oriented NLP tool will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical and translational research.","CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare",10136739,R44TR003254,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Belief', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Administration', 'International', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Operations Research', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Records', 'Research', 'Services', 'System', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'language training', 'learning algorithm', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NCATS,"MELAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2021,496453
"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP Project Summary Our program vision is to unravel the information buried in health-related narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of health texts and distributing them through an advanced NLP software platform under solid governance and sustainability. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. The underlying theme of this renewal is the development of methods towards generalizable, efficient and knowledge-rich models in the context of modern machine learning techniques, particularly models implementing attention mechanisms and using large unlabeled datasets. There is growing penetration of deep learning approaches in the field of health natural language processing. Our proposal aims to address critical methodological gaps and understudied areas in the current unprecedented fast-paced environment. Therefore, our renewal lays out novel and much needed explorations of health NLP research which we will advance through our specific aims. Our datasets will continue to span the spectrum of health-related data – Electronic Medical Records clinical narrative, patient-authored on- line community posts, and health-related social media. The evaluation of the methods we will develop will be performed on the key clinical tasks of concept extraction, relation extraction, and phenotyping with comparisons to other traditional or deep learning algorithms as baselines. We will demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing. Project Narrative There is a deluge of health texts.

"Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The purpose of this proposal is to develop two strategies, natural language processing (NLP) and automated speech analysis (ASA), to enable automated identification of patients with cognitive impairment (CI), from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) in clinical settings. The number of older adults in the United States with MCI and ADRD is increasing and yet the ability of clinicians and researchers to identify them at scale has advanced little over recent decades and screening with clinical assessments is done inconsistently. Alternative strategies using available data, like analysis of diagnostic codes in the clinical record or insurance claims, have very low sensitivity. NLP and ASA used with machine learning are technologies that could greatly increase ability to detect MCI and ADRD in clinical contexts. NLP automatically converts text in the electronic health record (EHR) into structured concepts suitable for analysis. Thus, clinicians’ documentation of signs and symptoms or orders of tests and services that reflect or address cognitive limitations can be efficiently captured, possibly long before the clinician uses an ADRD-related diagnostic code. ASA directly measures cognition by recognizing different features of cognition captured in speech. Extracting features through both NLP and ASA could thus provide a unique measure of cognition and its impact on the individual and their caregivers. Early detection of MCI and ADRD can help researchers identify appropriate patients for research and help clinicians and health systems target patients for preventive care and care coordination. For these reasons, more efficient, highly scalable strategies are needed to identify people with MCI and ADRD. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to (1) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from the EHR with NLP to identify patients with CI, (2) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from ASA of audio recordings of patient-provider encounters during routine primary care visits to identify patients with CI, (3) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using both NLP and ASA extracted features to create an integrated CI diagnostic algorithm. We will develop machine learning algorithms using NLP and ASA extracted features trained against neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validate them in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. In secondary analyses we will train ML algorithms to identify MCI and its subtypes. This project will be the most rigorous development of NLP, ASA, and ML algorithms for CI yet performed, the first to test ASA in primary care settings, and the first to test NLP and ASA feature extraction strategies in combination. The multi-disciplinary team of clinicians, health services researchers, and neurocognitive and data scientists will apply machine learning to develop these highly scalable, automated technologies for identification of MCI and ADRD. 1 Project Narrative The ability of clinicians, health systems and researchers to identify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) is limited. This project will apply machine learning to natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health record data and automated speech analysis (ASA) of patient-doctor conversations during primary care visits to identify patients with MCI and ADRD using automated and scalable procedures. The analytic algorithms will be developed with neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validated in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. 1",Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment,10144364,R01AG066471,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'New York City', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'adverse event risk', 'aging population', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'care coordination', 'clinical encounter', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'falls', 'feature extraction', 'financial incentive', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'screening', 'secondary analysis', 'structured data', 'success', 'testing services', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'unstructured data']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,805312
"Studying pseudogout using natural language processing and novel imaging approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (FROM FUNDED PARENT K23 APPLICATION) Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE (FROM FUNDED PARENT K23 APPLICATION) The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using natural language processing and novel imaging approaches,10292824,K23AR075070,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunology', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Serum', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'crystallinity', 'experience', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'stem']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2021,54000
"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews Summary ​Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) aims to inform patient care using all available evidence. Realizing this aim in practice would require access to concise, comprehensive, and up-to-date structured summaries of the evidence relevant to a particular clinical question. Systematic reviews of biomedical literature aim to provide such summaries, and are a critical component of the EBM arsenal and modern medicine more generally. However, such reviews are extremely laborious to conduct. Furthermore, owing to the rapid expansion of the biomedical literature base, they tend to go out of date quickly as new evidence emerges. These factors hinder the practice of evidence-based care. In this renewal proposal, we seek to continue our ground-breaking efforts on developing, evaluating, and deploying novel machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) methods to automate or semi-automate the evidence synthesis process. This will extend our innovative and successful efforts developing RobotReviewer and related technologies under the current grant. Concretely, for this renewal we propose to move from extraction of clinically salient data elements from individual trials to synthesis of these elements across trials. Our first aim is to extend our ML and NLP models to produce (as one deliverable) a publicly available, continuously and automatically updated semi-structured evidence database, comprising extracted data for all evidence, both published and unpublished. Unpublished trials will be identified via trial registries. Taking this up-to-date evidence repository as a starting point, we then propose cutting-edge ML and NLP models that will generate first drafts of evidence syntheses, automatically. More specifically we propose novel neural cross-document summarization models that will capitalize on the semi-structured information automatically extracted by our existing models, in addition to article texts. These models will be deployed in a new version of RobotReviewer, called RobotReviewerLive, intended to be a prototype for “living” systematic reviews. To rigorously evaluate the practical utility of the proposed methodological innovations, we will pilot their use to support real, ongoing, exemplar living reviews. Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Narrative We propose novel machine learning and natural language processing methods that will aid biomedical literature summarization and synthesis, and thereby support the conduct of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The proposed models and technologies will motivate core methodological innovations and support real-time, up-to-date, semi-automated biomedical evidence syntheses (“systematic reviews”). Such approaches are necessary if we are to have any hope of practicing evidence-based care in our era of information overload.",Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews,10199049,R01LM012086,"['American', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Population Intervention', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'database structure', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'search engine', 'structured data', 'study characteristics', 'study population', 'success', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'usability', 'working group']",NLM,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,292031
"Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis Project Abstract (30 lines of text)  1 Systematic review and evidence mapping, both forms of research synthesis, are formal, sequential processes  2 for identifying, assessing, and integrating the primary scientific literature. These approaches, already  3 cornerstones of evidence-based medicine, have recently gained significant popularity in several other  4 disciplines including environmental, agricultural, and public health research and are increasingly utilized for  5 informed decision making by governmental organizations. It has been estimated that more than 25,000  6 systematic reviews are conducted and published annually and selecting studies for inclusion is one of the most  7 resource intensive steps for any systematic review or evidence map. In Phase I of our research plan, we have  8 developed a web-based, collaborative systematic review web application called SWIFT-Active Screener, an  9 innovative document screening tool that allows users to identify the majority of relevant articles after screening 10 only a fraction of the total number of abstracts. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional 11 research and development required to make SWIFT-Active Screener a commercial success, while also 12 building on and leveraging methods and software we have previously built to address other stages in the 13 systematic review pipeline. Therefore, one of the primary aims of our ongoing research and development is to 14 address this need by expanding the Active Screener application into an integrated platform for research 15 synthesis by uniting it with several of our other related software products. The resulting platform, which we call 16 “swift.ai,” is described in detail in “Aim 1 – Software engineering to create a unified platform for research 17 synthesis.” In “Aim 2 – Improved statistical methods for Active Screener 2.0”, we expand on the methodological 18 research completed during Phase I of this SBIR, to further develop and refine our methods. Specifically, we 19 investigate new ways to integrate state-of-the art methods in deep learning and new ways to better utilize the 20 large amounts of screening data collected from our users in order to improve our models. Finally, in “Aim 3 – 21 Living evidence maps powered by Active Screener 2.0,” we explore new approaches for using machine 22 learning to facilitate evidence mapping. Project narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a unified, web-based, collaborative, systematic review software application that integrates the latest developments in deep-learning, machine learning, natural language processing and artificial intelligence, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis,10259172,R44ES029001,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Agriculture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Elements', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Influentials', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Formulations', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'active method', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'public health research', 'research and development', 'response', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'systematic review', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R44,2021,820314
"Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks ABSTRACT Relations linking various biomedical entities constitute a crucial resource that enables biomedical data science applications and knowledge discovery. Relational information spans the translational science spectrum going from biology (e.g., protein–protein interactions) to translational bioinformatics (e.g., gene–disease associations), and eventually to clinical care (e.g., drug–drug interactions). Scientists report newly discovered relations in nat- ural language through peer-reviewed literature and physicians may communicate them in clinical notes. More recently, patients are also reporting side-effects and adverse events on social media. With exponential growth in textual data, advances in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) methods are gaining prominence for biomedical relation extraction (BRE) from text. Most current efforts in BRE follow a pipeline approach containing named entity recognition (NER), entity normalization (EN), and relation classiﬁcation (RC) as subtasks. They typically suffer from error snowballing — errors in a component of the pipeline leading to more downstream errors — resulting in lower performance of the overall BRE system. This situation has lead to evaluation of different BRE substaks conducted in isolation. In this proposal we make a strong case for strictly end-to-end evaluations where relations are to be produced from raw text. We propose novel deep neural network architectures that model BRE in an end-to-end fashion and directly identify relations and corresponding entity spans in a single pass. We also extend our architectures to n-ary and cross-sentence settings where more than two entities may need to be linked even as the relation is expressed across multiple sentences. We also propose to create two new gold standard BRE datasets, one for drug–disease treatment relations and another ﬁrst of a kind dataset for combination drug therapies. Our main hypothesis is that our end-to-end extraction models will yield supe- rior performance when compared with traditional pipelines. We test this through (1). intrinsic evaluations based on standard performance measures with several gold standard datasets and (2). extrinsic application oriented assessments of relations extracted with use-cases in information retrieval, question answering, and knowledge base completion. All software and data developed as part of this project will be made available for public use and we hope this will foster rigorous end-to-end benchmarking of BRE systems. NARRATIVE Relations connecting biomedical entities are at the heart of biomedical research given they encapsulate mech- anisms of disease etiology, progression, and treatment. As most such relations are ﬁrst disclosed in textual narratives (scientiﬁc literature or clinical notes), methods to extract and represent them in a structured format are essential to facilitate applications such as hypotheses generation, question answering, and information retrieval. The high level objective of this project is to develop and evaluate novel end-to-end supervised machine learning methods for biomedical relation extraction using latest advances in deep neural networks.",Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks,10200889,R01LM013240,"['Adverse event', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drug Interactions', 'Encapsulated', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Heart', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Sciences', 'Intramural Research', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trees', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'clinical care', 'deep neural network', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'protein protein interaction', 'relating to nervous system', 'side effect', 'social media', 'supervised learning', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2021,332681
"Facilitate Observational Studies of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias Using Ontology and Natural Language Processing Project Summary As the 6th leading cause of death in the US, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5.7 million Americans. However, up until now, our understanding of risk factors of AD/ADRD is still limited and our efforts on developing effective treatments for AD/ADRD have been greatly disappointing. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new methods to conduct AD/ADRD research more efficiently. One of the potential approaches is to leverage large, longitudinal, observational clinical data accumulated in electronic health records (EHRs). Nevertheless, current uses of EHRs for AD/ADRD research is very limited, often requiring manual data extraction and normalization (i.e., manual chart review), which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, in this study, we plan to develop novel ontology and natural language processing (NLP) based informatics methods and tools to automatically extract and normalize AD/ADRD-related clinical data in EHRs, thus facilitating efficient AD/ADRD observational studies using EHRs. We propose the following three specific aims to achieve this goal: 1) Build an information model for EHR-based AD/ADRD research using a formal ontology representation approach; and 2) Extract and normalize AD/ADRD information in clinical documents using NLP technologies; and 3) Evaluate developed informatics methods and tools through demonstration studies and disseminate them to support observational AD/ADRD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we propose to develop novel informatics approaches to automatically extract detailed clinical information about Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) patients (e.g., disease diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and response) from heterogeneous electronic health records databases.

"COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data Project Summary/Abstract  The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway. However, there is still a major gap in that much data is still not openly shareable, which we propose to address. In addition, current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions) as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. substantial computational re- sources and time is needed to pool data from large studies with local study data). This needs to change, so that the scientific community can create a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see overview on this from our group7). The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while (if required) leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator or the data host; this motivates a dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. During the previous funding period, we developed a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). Our system provides an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data is avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. During this new phase we respond to the need for advanced algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, by proposing to develop decentralized models for these approaches and also implement a fully scalable cloud-based framework with enhanced security features. To achieve this, in Aim 1, we will incorporate the necessary functionality to scale up analyses via the ability to work with either local or commercial private cloud environments, together with advanced visualization, quality control, and privacy and security features. This suite of new functions will open the floodgates for the use of COINSTAC by the larger neuroscience community to enable new discovery and analysis of unprecedented amounts of brain imaging data located throughout the world. We will also improve usability, training materials, engage the community in contributing to the open source code base, and ultimately facilitate the use of COINSTAC's tools for additional science and discovery in a broad range of applications. In Aim 2 we will extend the framework to handle powerful algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, and to perform meta-learning for leveraging and updating fit models. And finally, in Aim 3, we will test this new functionality through a partnership with the worldwide ENIGMA addiction group, which is currently not able to perform advanced machine learning analyses on data that cannot be centrally located. We will evaluate the impact of 6 main classes of substances of abuse (e.g. methamphetamines, cocaine, cannabis, nicotine, opiates, alcohol and their combinations) using the new developed functionality. 3 Project Narrative  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on collecting human neuroimaging data for clinical and re- search studies, many of which do not come with subject consent for sharing or contain sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a viable solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we propose enables us to capture this `missing data' and achieve the same performance as pooling of both open and `closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of advanced and cutting edge algorithms (including linear mixed effects models and deep learning) and incorpo- rating within an easy-to-use and scalable platform which enables distributed computation. 2","COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",10269008,R01DA040487,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cannabis', 'Clinical Data', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methamphetamine', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Security', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Substance of Abuse', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'cloud based', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data harmonization', 'data repository', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'distributed data', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'life-long learning', 'negative affect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open data', 'open source', 'peer', 'privacy preservation', 'repository', 'scale up', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,617911
"Identification of Trauma-related Features in EHR Data for Patients with Psychosis and Mood Disorders Project Summary Psychotic and mood disorders represent a major driver of disability as well as health care cost. There is considerable clinical heterogeneity among patients. Developing clinically implementable machine learning (ML) tools to enable accurate patient stratification is critically important in order to augment effective personalized treatment plans. Among the factors contributing to heterogeneity, childhood trauma is an under-recognized source. The prevalence of childhood trauma is significant in adults with psychiatric disorders. Robust evidence shows that: i) individuals exposed to childhood abuse are 2-3 times more likely to develop a psychiatric disorder later in life, particularly psychosis; ii) childhood traumas impact critical windows of brain development and can trigger the onset of psychosis; and iii) among patients with psychotic and mood disorders, childhood trauma influences psychopathology, leading to more severe symptoms, poorer long-term outcomes (longer and higher rate of relapses or rehospitalization), associated with substance abuse, and are often treatment resistant and function poorly in society. Although evidence clearly indicates that childhood trauma contributes to psychiatric risk and poor treatment outcomes, large-scale computational approaches to stratify subpopulations, extract trauma features (e.g., frequency, type), and examine the links or the impact of trauma features on psychopathology and treatment outcome have yet to be developed. We propose to create gold standard annotations from Electronic health records (EHRs) and to leverage natural language processing (NLP) and ML methods to develop a standardized re-useable data model for automatically extracting trauma-related features, complex concepts, and symptom dimensions from EHRs. We will train and evaluate a semi-supervised NLP model, which is built as a joint sequence model that can both identify named entities as well as extract the relations between them. We will apply multiple strategies to validate the robustness of our model. Our proposed NLP model is essentially a “computational version of a chart review” tool, designed to mimic human chart review but performed automatically with the ability to scale. We will use this model to stratify psychosis subgroups (with or without childhood trauma history) and to correlate among the extracted features with important clinical outcome variables. Importantly, the annotation guidelines, corpus, and the data model developed by us will be valuable resources to researchers in the field. The study builds on existing collaborations between a team experienced in psychiatric phenotyping and application of EHRs, and a team active in developing and applying emerging methods in ML to natural language data. The model architecture developed in this application will lay the groundwork for a future clinical trial application. Project Narrative There is considerable clinical heterogeneity among patients with psychotic and mood disorders. This project will use electronic health record databases and machine learning approaches to automatically stratify subpopulations, to examine the impact of childhood trauma on psychopathology, and to establish a gold standard annotation guideline and a standardized re-useable data model for use by the psychiatric community. Development of a “computational version of chart review” tool will be cost-effective and allow for future large- scale clinical investigations.",Identification of Trauma-related Features in EHR Data for Patients with Psychosis and Mood Disorders,10296954,R21MH125076,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Sexual Abuse', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Mediation', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Psychotic Mood Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically significant', 'computing resources', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data reuse', 'data standards', 'design', 'disability', 'emotional abuse', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'natural language', 'new therapeutic target', 'patient health information', 'patient stratification', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized medicine', 'physical abuse', 'repository', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'structured data', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'unstructured data']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R21,2021,220614
"National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives Project Summary and Abstract Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Natural language processing (NLP) technologies can extract this information and convert it in to a structured format that is more readily accessible by computerized systems. However, the development of NLP systems is contingent on access to relevant data and EHRs are notoriously difficult to obtain because of privacy reasons. Despite the recent efforts to de-identify and release narrative EHRs for research, these data are still very rare. As a result, clinical NLP, as a field has lagged behind. To address this problem, since 2006, we organized thirteen shared tasks, accompanied with workshops and journal publications. Twelve of these shared tasks have focused on the development of clinical NLP systems and the remaining one on the usability of these systems. We have covered both depth and breadth in terms of shared tasks, preparing tasks that study cutting-edge NLP problems on a variety of EHR data from multiple institutions. Our shared tasks are the longest running series of clinical NLP shared tasks, with ever growing EHR data sets, tasks, and participation. Our most popular three data sets have been cited 495 (2010 data), 284 (2006 de-id data), and 274 (2009 data) times, respectively, representing hundreds of articles that have come out of these three data sets alone. Our goal in this proposal is to continue the efforts we started in 2006 under i2b2 shared task challenges (i2b2, NIH NLM U54LM008748, PI: Kohane and R13 LM011411, PI: Uzuner) to de-identify EHRs, annotate them with gold- standard annotations for clinical NLP tasks, and release them to the research community for the development and head-to-head comparison of clinical NLP systems, for the advancement of the state of the art. Continuing our efforts under National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) based at the Health Data Science program of the newly established Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, we aim to form partnerships with the community to grow the shared task efforts in several ways: (1) grow the available de-identified EHR data sets through partnerships that can contribute to the volume and variety of the data, and (2) grow the available gold-standard annotations in terms of depth and breadth of NLP tasks. Given these aims and partnerships, we plan to hold a series of shared tasks. We will complement these shared tasks with workshops that meet in conjunction with the Fall Symposium of the American Medical Informatics Association and with journal special issues so that advancement of the state of the art can be sped up and future generations can build on the past. Project Narrative We propose to organize a series of shared tasks, workshops, and journal publications for fostering the continuous development of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies that can extract information from narratives of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Our aim is to grow the annotated gold standard EHR data sets that are available to the research community through partnerships and to bring together clinical NLP researchers with informatics researchers for building collaborations. We will engage the community in shared tasks and disseminate the knowledge generated by these shared tasks through workshops and journal special issues for the advancement of the state of the art.",National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives,10139100,R13LM013127,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'American', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Future Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Israel', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Privacy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical development', 'computerized', 'falls', 'head-to-head comparison', 'health data', 'indexing', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'practical application', 'programs', 'symposium', 'usability', 'working group']",NLM,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R13,2021,20000
"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,10085652,R01GM124443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomechanical model', 'community building', 'complex biological systems', 'data access', 'data cleaning', 'data ecosystem', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'member', 'metadata standards', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'role model', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,489919
"Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) Cigarette smoking accounts for 480,000 premature deaths and one third of all cancer deaths annually in the US. There is enormous need for high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking cessation. For the past 15 years, mobile phone-delivered text messaging interventions such as the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT have been a prominent technology addressing this need. However, very much like all widely available technologies for smoking cessation (e.g., websites), text messaging interventions have modest quit rates, driven largely by low engagement. Fortunately, a new technology provides a therapeutic conversation to address the problem of engagement that impacts text messaging and other current digital technologies for smoking cessation. Advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are now making it possible to create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through conversations. CAs are supportive, empathic, reflectively listen, provide personalized responses, and offer goal setting and advice appropriately timed to the needs of the user. Regarding CAs for smoking cessation, the major knowledge gaps are: (1) their efficacy, (2) theoretical mechanisms, and (3) the cost-effectiveness. Also unexplored are the potential baseline moderators of CAs for smoking cessation. We recently developed a CA for smoking cessation, called “QuitBot,” evaluated it in a diary study, and then tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 306), comparing it with the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT. The pilot RCT design was very feasible with 93% three-month follow-up. QuitBot had: (a) high participant engagement and (b) high quit rates at the three-month follow-up—very promising in comparison with SmokefreeTXT. Addressing these knowledge gaps and building on the promising results of our QuitBot research, the project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of QuitBot (n = 760) versus SmokefreeTXT (n = 760) with 12-month follow-up in order to determine whether QuitBot: (1) provides higher quit rates than SmokefreeTXT, (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by therapeutic alliance processes and engagement, and (3) is cost-effective vs. SmokefreeTXT. In addition, this study will explore whether these baseline factors moderate the effectiveness of QuitBot: trust, social support, and demographics (e.g., sex). This innovative project will advance the fields of research on CAs both for smoking cessation in particular and for health behavior change in general— regardless of whether the results are positive or null. Positive results could have high population-level impact and stimulate new lines of research into CA dissemination and implementation, and the adaptation of CAs for multiple subpopulations of smokers, languages, and community and medical settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The overall aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness of a conversational agent for smoking cessation. If successful, this intervention can be cost-effectively scaled on a population level, thereby making a high public health impact.",Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation,10120658,R01CA247156,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antismoking', 'Car Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Cost Measures', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empathy', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Health behavior change', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social support', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic', 'Trust', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'patient engagement', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized effectiveness trial', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'sex', 'smartphone Application', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'text messaging intervention', 'web site']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,730398
"Optimizing BCI-FIT: Brain Computer Interface - Functional Implementation Toolkit SUMMARY  Many of the estimated four million adults in the U.S. with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases cannot rely on current assistive technologies (AT) for communication. During a single day, or as their disease progresses, they may transition from one access technology to another due to fatigue, medications, changing physical status, or progressive motor dysfunction. There are currently no clinical or AT solutions that adapt to the multiple, dynamic access needs of these individuals, leaving many people poorly served. This competitive renewal, called BCI-FIT (Brain Computer Interface-Functional Implementation Toolkit) adds to our innovative multidisciplinary translational research conducted over the past 11 years for the advancement of science related to non-invasive BCIs for communication for these clinical populations. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multiple modality signals in real-time. The BCI-FIT acronym has many implications: our BCI fits to each user's brain signals; to the environment, offering relevant personal language; to the user's internal states, adjusting signals based on drowsiness, medications, physical and cognitive abilities; and to users' learning patterns from BCI introduction to expert use.  Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop and evaluate methods for optimizing system and user performance with on-line, robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models. (2) Develop and evaluate methods for efficient user intent inference through active querying. (3) Integrate language interaction and letter/word supplementation as input modalities in real-time BCI use. Four single case experimental research designs will evaluate both user performance and technology performance for functional communication with 35 participants with SSPI in the community, and 30 healthy controls for preliminary testing. The same dependent variables will be tested in all experiments: typing accuracy (correct character selections divided by total character selections), information transfer rate (ITR), typing speed (correct characters/minute), and user experience (UX) questionnaire responses about comfort, workload, and satisfaction. Our goal is to establish individualized recommendations for each user based on a combination of clinical and machine expertise. The clinical expertise plus user feedback added to active sensor fusion and reinforcement learning for intent inference will produce optimized multi-modal BCIs for each end-user that can adjust to short- and long-term fluctuating function. Our research is conducted by four sub-teams who have collaborated successfully to implement translational science: Electrical/computer engineering; Neurophysiology and systems science; Natural language processing; and Clinical rehabilitation. The project is grounded in solid machine learning approaches with models of participatory action research and AAC participation. This project will improve technologies and BCI technical capabilities, demonstrate BCI implementation paradigms and clinical guidelines for people with severe disabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies, as proposed in BCI-FIT.

"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,10162578,R44DA050155,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Epidemic', 'Government', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New England', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Program Description', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'addiction', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'literature citation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid therapy', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'synthetic opioid', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2021,753275
"Audio Generation and Optimization from Existing Resources for Patient Education Project Summary/Abstract Health literacy is vital to achieving and maintaining good health. Several national programs have emphasized this goal and its importance. Text is generally much more efficient and cost-effective for presenting healthcare information on a large scale than interactive tools and videos. Over the past decade, therefore, most medical information has been provided as text, e.g., via printed pamphlets or on websites. We are entering a new era where a new similarly effective mode of information dissemination is becoming increasingly available: audio accessed with mobile devices. Millions of households have and use smart speakers and virtual assistants and they are increasingly used by patients and consumers to gather information. Hospitals also plan to gradually integrate them among their tools. However, there exist few if any guidelines on optimal generation and use of audio. The overall goal of this project is to discover how to support the creation of optimal audio from existing text sources for consumer and patient education. To accomplish this, four aims are proposed. The first aim is to identify audio features that affect information comprehension and retention. Here, features in audio content and style (e.g., word frequency or grammatical complexity) of the underlying information will be tested for impact. In addition, two groups of features specific to the audio medium will be tested: the delivery features (e.g., speed and pauses) as well as meta-features (e.g., speaker characteristics such as gender or accent and bias in listeners). This first aim will rely on large-scale datasets, semi-automatically generated and augmented with user scores for comprehension gathered using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Statistical and machine learning approaches will be used to tease out the best features and combinations. The second aim focuses on discovering how to augment text for audio and finding the optimal combination of text and audio for information comprehension and retention. Different combinations will be tested online with MTurk participants using controlled user studies. The third aim is to update, test and provide the existing online free text editor to generate optimized audio. We will also start dissemination of the tool to potential users including API access to components. The project will conclude with a summative evaluation with representative consumers recruited at a local community health center and further dissemination of preferences, practical obstacles, and best practices for the medical community to help increase health literacy through this new, popular audio medium. If successful, this project will generate best practices for the medical community in using audio as an additional method for bringing healthcare information to the general public; it will provide an online, free tool to generate audio leveraging these best practices and will include API access so that other researchers can easily integrate tool components into their research and tools; and it will provide immediate practical lessons from working with consumers relevant for clinical practice. Project Narrative Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary for achieving and maintaining health. The increased adoption of smart speakers and virtual assistants by consumers and in medical settings has created novel opportunities to educate the population by delivering health information through audio or audio combined with text. Because few (if any) tools exist to improve content and generate optimal audio, we aim to discover supportive and adverse features of audio/text information provision and create a free, online software tool for optimizing health-related text with demonstrated impact on information comprehension and retention.",Audio Generation and Optimization from Existing Resources for Patient Education,10295641,R01LM011975,"['Accent', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Arizona', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Information Dissemination', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Participant', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Update', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Work Simplification', 'Writing', 'application programming interface', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'intelligent personal assistant', 'interactive tool', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'open source', 'preference', 'programs', 'real world application', 'recruit', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,257905
"Unified Computation Tools for Natural Products Research Summary The overarching goal for this proposed renewal application will be to further advance tools that are in development and to effectively integrate several types of analytical data with biological assay data and genomic information. This will create a powerful set of tools for faster and even more accurate identification of new molecules, dereplication of known ones, and to directly infer biological activities from spectroscopic information. In the current period of support, we have made substantial progress in developing highly useful tools for automatic annotations and identifications of organic molecules, specifically focused on natural products. The Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Networking analysis and knowledge dissemination ecosystem has processed almost 160,000 jobs in nearly 160 countries worldwide, has 4-6,000 new job submissions per month and is accessed over 200,000 times a month (majority accessions are for reference library access, inspection of public data and previous jobs that the community shares as hyperlinks in papers), and has become a mainstream tool for the annotation of organic molecules deriving from diverse sources, especially in metabolomics workflows. The public website for Small Molecule Accurate Recognition Technology (SMART), a deep learning model for providing candidate structures based on 1H-13C HSQC NMR data, went live in December 2019 and already has over 3000 jobs in 50 countries. All tools developed in this proposal will become part of this analysis ecosystem. The four laboratories contributing to this proposed research activity have created an open and integrated team that is continuing to creatively innovate new informatic tools to enhance small molecule structure annotations and inference of their chemical and biological properties. We have four specific aims: 1) To complete the development and evaluation of a set of new and innovative tools for natural products analysis, and deploy these as freely available resources for the worldwide community. 2) To refine the structural characterization of molecules through leveraging repository scale mass spectral information along with NMR data and genomic inputs. 3) To create a new SMART-based tool that integrates mass spectrometry and HSQC NMR data as the input for a new deep learning system with the goal of achieving more accurate predictions of structure. 4) To use deep learning to enhance SMART with bioactivity data so as to enable SMART to predict activities of molecules based on spectroscopic features. The data will also augment the GNPS database with biological assay binding data. An additional consequence of these goals will be the further digitization of natural products analytical data so that they can be used in the computational tools planned herein, as well as other tools in the future. Completion of these four specific aims will create new integrated tools for the precise identification of new natural product structures, and enable inference of their structural relatedness to other classes of organic molecules and their biological properties. Thus, these new informatic tools will have the potential to greatly enhance the small molecule drug discovery process.         Unified Computational Tools for Natural Products Research Approximately 50% of all FDA approved drugs trace their origins to natural products, either directly or through indirect routes of development.

"Large scale clinical and economic impact analysis of potentially malignant incidental findings in radiology reports Abstract Unexpected findings, or incidentalomas, are increasing dramatically with the growth in the use of imaging technology within healthcare organizations. Incidentalomas may indicate significant health problems, such as malignancy in the medium or long term. However, they also may lead to overinvestigation, unnecessary radiation exposure, overtreatment, substantial downstream expenditures, and patient anxiety. Several systematic reviews have explored the prevalence and outcomes of incidentalomas. These studies used inconsistent and often inappropriate synthesis methods, commonly only focusing on one imaging scan or organ in a very limited number of patients. As a result, there is need for large-scale study of incidentalomas that can inform their follow up and guide efforts to optimize health outcomes. To address this need, we propose to build natural language processing (NLP) approaches to identify cancer-related incidentalomas reported in radiology reports (Aim 1) and to create the first large-scale incidentaloma database covering over half-a-million patients (Aim 2). Our research dataset will contain radiology reports, clinical notes containing imaging orders, as well as structured data such as demographic information (e.g., age) and diagnoses codes of patients who received radiologic imaging tests in University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC), Harborview Medical Center (HMC), Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA), and Northwest Hospital and Medical Center (NWMC) between 2007-2019. Our patient population will be linked to Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research (HICOR) data repository for detailed cancer outcomes and claims data. The created database will be used for clinical and economic analysis of incidentalomas (Aim 3). We will (1) evaluate the concordance between radiologists' documentation of incidentaloma follow-up and established clinical guidelines for thyroid, lung, adrenal, kidney, liver, and pancreas incidentalomas, (2) determine risk of subsequent cancer diagnosis and median survival for each category of incidentaloma, and (3) determine the incremental cost associated with follow-up imaging in patients with incidentalomas. All models and their implementations produced during the execution of this project will be shared with the community as open source. Additionally, the de-identified incidentaloma database will be made available to the research community under a data use agreement. By identifying risk factors for cancer diagnosis and death for common incidental findings, we will be able to provide critical information for future clinical practice guideline development and appropriate use criteria. We assembled a highly interdisciplinary team of experts in NLP, medical informatics, radiology, oncology, health outcomes, and health economics to ensure the successful completion of the proposed project. Project Narrative Incidentalomas may indicate significant health problems, such as malignancy to the patient in the short or medium term, but also may lead to overtreatment, which comes with substantial downstream expenditures as well as patient anxiety. In this project, we will build natural language processing approaches to extract cancer related incidentalomas reported in radiology reports (Aim 1) and create the first large scale incidentaloma database for half-a-million patients who received radiologic imaging tests in University of Washington Medical Center, Harborview Medical Center, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, and Northwest Hospital and Medical Center between 2007 and 2019 (Aim 2). This database will be used for clinical and economic analysis of incidentalomas (Aim 3).",Large scale clinical and economic impact analysis of potentially malignant incidental findings in radiology reports,10116614,R01CA248422,"['Abdomen', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Angiography', 'Anxiety', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidental Findings', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Cyst', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Thyroid Nodule', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'clinical database', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data repository', 'economic evaluation', 'economic impact', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'health care service organization', 'health economics', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'overtreatment', 'patient population', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'repository', 'structured data', 'surveillance imaging', 'systematic review', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,674025
"Data Science to Power Implementation with Social Determinants of Health - from Data to Action Specific aims Our overall goal is to build multidisciplinary networks around data and implementation science to drive science and translation, and advance improvements in the development, implementation and dissemination of medical evidence, with an examination of social determinants of health and disparities through the lens of Artificial Intelligence (AI). We will focus on generating evidence on substance use, to enhance early detection, prevention efforts and accelerate initiation of and adherence to treatment. The focus will be on exploring uses of AI in big data and in identifying novel sources of data.

"Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY This application is for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington and affiliated institutions. This Center has over the past 25 years provided key resources in support of investigators who study the biology of aging. This application continues a theme that emphasizes outreach and service to the broadest community of investigators in the gerosciences. Of proximal relevance is the characterization of aging-related phenotypes of longevity and healthspan. As our Center services must be easily accessible to outside users, our Longevity and Healthspan Core (Core E) focuses on invertebrate assays, many of them novel. Two other Resources Cores focus on the high dimensional assessments that are closely related to aging phenotypes: Protein Phenotypes of Aging (Core C) and Metabolite Phenotypes of Aging (Core D). Sophisticated computational and bioinformatic tools for data analysis and optimal insight are provided by the Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Core F. Each of these four Resource Cores is led by highly respected experts in that field, including Michael MacCoss and Judit Villen (Core C), Daniel Promislow (Core D), Matt Kaeberlein and Maitreya Dunham (Core E) and Su-In Lee (Core F). Each will push the envelope of appropriate technologies, developing new state-of-the art approaches for assessments that are the most applicable to gerontology and making them accessible to the national aging community. The Research Development Core (Core B) will continue to support pilot and junior faculty studies, with a firm focus on outreach of service to the national geroscience constituency. The Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, courses, and data sharing and dissemination. Core A’s program of seminars and symposia will continue a focus on sponsorship and organization of national courses, meetings and pre-meetings, as well as workshops in the fields allied to our Resource Core Services. In coordination with other Nathan Shock Centers, we will support a new Geropathology Research initiative. UW NATHAN SHOCK CENTER OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We apply for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington, which has for 25 years provided key resources supporting investigators who study the biology of aging. The overarching goal of this Center is to have a positive impact on the field by accelerating research discovery and providing research support for investigators nationally and internationally, particularly junior investigators in the process of building their own research programs. We will accomplish this goal through six cores that function synergistically together: four Resource Cores with particular expertise in protein (Core C) and metabolite (Core D) phenotypes of aging, invertebrate longevity and healthspan phenotypes (Core E) and artificial intelligence and bioinformatics (Core F), along with a Research Development Core (Core B) that supports external pilot projects and junior faculty studies, and an Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) that supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, sponsorship and organization of national meetings and pre-meetings, courses, workshops and seminars, and, in coordination with other Nathan Shock Centers, a Geropathology Research initiative.",Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging,10260476,P30AG013280,"['Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology of Aging', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Faculty', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Gerontology', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Office of Administrative Management', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Philosophy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'bioinformatics tool', 'career development', 'cell age', 'computerized tools', 'data dissemination', 'data sharing', 'healthspan', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'outreach', 'outreach services', 'programs', 'protein metabolite', 'research and development', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P30,2021,962037
"Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders The Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders supports a full day of presentations by leading scientists in areas that are having transformational effects in the communication sciences and disorders (CSD) discipline. The Research Symposium is held at the annual Convention of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and is open to all of the approximately 15,000 Convention attendees, which includes students, practitioners, and researchers. Following Convention, the Symposium content is widely disseminated through audio recordings of the presentations, which are synced with the slides and transcribed, and by making them freely accessible on the ASHA website. Additionally, each presenter submits an article based on their presentation to the Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research to be published in the annual Research Symposium Forum. An innovation that will be implemented in this current funding cycle is that ASHA will make these articles freely accessible upon publication on the ASHA Journals website and will deposit them in PubMed Central without embargo. The first aim of the Research Symposium grant is to advance scientific discourse and dissemination of scientific discovery and innovation on five topics that are having transformational effects across several subareas in CSD. This will be accomplished, in part, by making the Research Symposium Forum open access and by widely promoting both the recorded and the written content across ASHA’s many communication channels. Over the next 5-year funding cycle, the Symposium will address five topics that cut across the areas of hearing, speech, language, and other aspects of cognition, including (1) Health and Healthcare Equity of People With Communication Disabilities, (2) Bilingualism, (3) Artificial Intelligence in CSD, (4) Genetics in CSD, and (5) Intervention and Implementation Clinical Trials in CSD. The second aim of the Research Symposium grant is to advance the research career development of early- career scientists focused on research in CSD. Between 2021 and 2025, the Research Mentoring- Pair Travel Award and ASHA’s in-kind contribution will provide funding to attend the Symposium and mentoring support to 130 early-career scientists in CSD. The Travel Award recipients will attend the Symposium along with a mentor and engage in mentored research activities before, during, and after each Symposium. These activities are designed to help integrate the protégés into their scientific community and encourage them to pursue a research career and become productive scholars. The scientific base of the CSD discipline will be strengthened by these scientific dissemination, research education, and mentoring activities. The Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders aims to strengthen the scientific base and increase the research capacity of the discipline, which will lead to improvements in the communication health of millions people with communication or related disorders. The Symposium presentations will advance the scientific dialogue and be broadly disseminated through freely available peer-reviewed publications and transcribed recordings. The associated Travel Award will provide funds to support 130 promising early-career scientists in attending the Research Symposium and engaging in mentored research activities before, during, after the Symposium to increase their recruitment and retention in a research career.",Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders,10070224,R13DC003383,"['Address', 'American Speech-Language-Hearing Association', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Communication Disability', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Degree program', 'Deposition', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hour', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Outcome Measure', 'Peer Review', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Slide', 'Speech', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Work', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical trial implementation', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'doctoral student', 'education research', 'experience', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'online community', 'recruit', 'social media', 'stem', 'symposium', 'web site']",NIDCD,AMERICAN SPEECH-LANGUAGE-HEARING ASSN,R13,2021,39900
"UT Southwestern Center for Translational Medicine Contact PD/PI: Toto, Robert D OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Center for Translational Medicine (CTM) at UT Southwestern is a collaboration among 7 academic institutions, 5 health care systems, 6 teaching hospitals and the North Texas community. Our mission is to improve health in local and global communities through innovation and education. Over the past two funding cycles, our CTSA catalyzed innovation and transformed the culture and landscape of our program Hub. We have trained >1,000 members of the translational workforce, co-led the formation of the Accrual to Clinical Trials CTSA network and established new translational technologies, methods, and processes critical to the translational process at every level. We engaged our local communities early on in the design and conduct of clinical research. We also formed new collaborative research services and education and training programs designed to address the top health challenges of our community and the nation. Through these efforts, the CTM has generated considerable momentum toward advancing translational science propelled by a highly collaborative environment that is hard-wired for Team Science and Community Engagement.  Over the next 5 years, we will optimize the organization of our CTSA Hub for more efficient translation of biomedical discoveries into interventions that will ultimately result in the improved health of both our local populations and, in collaboration with the CTSA Network, the broader U.S. population. We will discover, develop, demonstrate, and disseminate new informatics and artificial intelligence solutions to challenging problems in translation at all levels. In collaboration with Hub partners and relevant national CTSA networks, we propose to develop new methods and processes to further the integration of research into practice at the point of care. Building on our success, we are now poised to achieve the five key objectives of the CTSA Program and the Center for Translational Medicine with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Produce a well-trained, highly skilled, diverse Translational Workforce. Aim 2. Inculcate Community Engagement and Team Science. Aim 3. Integrate diverse populations across the lifespan into clinical and translational research. Aim 4. Promote innovation and new scientific Methods and Processes. Aim 5. Develop innovative Informatics solutions to overcome translational roadblocks. Aim 6. Increase Workforce Heterogeneity. Impact: With our highly-integrated dynamic research and training environment in place, our Hub will have a powerful and sustained impact on the field of translational science. We will make a major leap forward in the scope, efficiency, and quality of clinical and translational research for the benefit of our Hub and the national consortium.

"Breakthrough Molecular Dynamics Research via an Anton2 Supercomputer Project Summary In 2010, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) and D.E. Shaw Research (DESRES) partnered to make the Anton special-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) supercomputer available to the national biomedical research community for the first time. Anton enabled researchers to simulate biomolecular systems two orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer, allowing researchers access to critical multi- microsecond and longer timescales on which most biologically-significant molecular processes take place. In 2016, with operational support from NIH, DESRES made available a next generation Anton 2 system at PSC at no cost. This multimillion-dollar gift from DESRES, with NIH support, provided a unique opportunity for researchers to tackle even more groundbreaking biological questions by simulating systems as large as 700,000 atoms at a rate of multiple microseconds per day. The goal of this renewal project is to provide the national biomedical research community with continued access to this unique and powerful Anton 2 resource and to maximize the benefit of this resource to the community. Since 2010, PSC has supported 589 research projects conducted by 202 unique PIs on the Anton systems hosted at PSC. So far, these projects have resulted in 292 publications, many of which have had significant impact on their fields of research. These fields cover the entire spectrum of biomolecular processes that form the fundamental underpinnings of biology, including protein folding, ion channel selectivity and gating, membrane dynamics and organization, protein- ligand binding, and many others. Demand for Anton 2 is quite high, with 2-3x higher demand than can be met each year. Given this, our goals are focused not only on providing continued access but also on maximizing the value of this limited resource to the community—recognizing that the creativity of the broad, diverse Anton 2 research community is one of our most powerful resources for innovation. Anton 2 will be integrated as an XSEDE service provider, and the accessibility and impact of Anton 2 will significantly increase by engaging in their extensive broadening participation, outreach, and training programs. Through these outreach efforts, researchers at many more institutions will have the opportunity to use Anton 2, especially researchers from traditionally underrepresented groups in biomedical research. The hundreds of long-timescale MD trajectories researchers generate on Anton 2 constitute a unique and valuable dataset that can be used to gain additional biomedical knowledge and advance the application of machine learning protocols to augment molecular dynamics simulations. This important dataset will be available to researchers and educators worldwide through a web portal and co-located on the PSC's Bridges-2 system for classroom instruction and research, including reanalysis, machine learning, and data mining. Project Narrative The Anton 2 supercomputer made available at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center through this award will enable researchers to simulate biomolecular systems orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer. This powerful resource will enable biomedical researchers to better understand the fundamental biomolecular processes of biology, leading to better ways to treat disease and improve quality of life.",Breakthrough Molecular Dynamics Research via an Anton2 Supercomputer,10211715,R01GM116961,"['Academy', 'Area', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health Education', 'Creativeness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Evaluation Reports', 'FAIR principles', 'Funding', 'Gifts', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Ion Channel', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Molecular', 'National Research Council', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'anxious', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'broadening participation research', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'price lists', 'protein folding', 'service providers', 'supercomputer', 'uptake', 'web portal']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,408856
"Developing novel technologies that ensure privacy and security in biomedical data science research Data science holds the promise of enabling new pathways to discovery and can improve the understanding, prevention and treatment of complex disorders such as cancer, diabetes, substance abuse, etc., which are significantly on the rise. The promise of data science can be fully realized only when collected data can be collaboratively shared and analyzed. However, the widespread increases in healthcare data breaches due to inappropriate access as well as the increasing number of novel privacy attacks restrict institutions from sharing data. Indeed, in some cases, the results of the analysis can themselves lead to significant privacy harm. The success of the data commons depends on ensuring the maximal access to data, subject to all of the patient privacy requirements including those mandated by legislation, and all of the constraints of the organization collecting the data itself. While there are existing solutions that can solve parts of the problem, there are significant challenges in truly incorporating these into comprehensive working solutions that are usable by the biomedical research community, and new challenges brought on by modern techniques such as deep learning. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that can holistically enable data sharing while respecting privacy and security considerations and to ensure that they are implemented in existing platforms that have widespread acceptance in the research community. Towards this, the objective of this project is to develop complementary solutions for risk inference, distributed learning, and access control that can enable different modalities of data sharing. The problems studied are general in nature and will evolve depending on research successes and new impediments that arise. The proposed program of research is significant since lack of access to biomedical data can lead to fragmentation of care, resulting in higher economic and social costs, and is a significant impediment to biomedical research. The project will result in open-source, freely available software tools that will be integrated into widely used data collection, cohort identification, and distributed analytics platforms. There are several ongoing collaborations that will serve as initial pilot customers to provide use cases, identify the requirements, evaluate results, and in general validate the developed solutions. Project Narrative Statement of Relevance to Public Health Being able to ensure privacy and security while enabling data sharing and analysis is critical to pave the way forward for public health research and improve our understanding of diseases. The proposed work will address the challenges that impede the use of data across all of the different modalities of data sharing. The integration into existing platforms will ensure that the developed models, tools, and solutions directly impact the research community and improve public health interventions.",Developing novel technologies that ensure privacy and security in biomedical data science research,10077318,R35GM134927,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Science', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Security', 'Software Tools', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'biomedical data science', 'care fragmentation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health research', 'social', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ NEWARK,R35,2021,383279
