"Unraveling subcellular heterogeneity of molecular coordination by machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in fluorescence microscopy allow researchers to acquire an unprecedented amount of live cell image data at high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, these images pose a significant challenge for data analyses due to massive subcellular heterogeneity. Although conventional computer vision algorithms have facilitated automatic image analysis, traditional ensemble-averaging of subcellular heterogeneity could lead to the loss of critical mechanistic details. Given the current rapid growth of cell biological data from new technological development, it is nearly impossible to keep up with the data generation if we solely rely on human intelligence for algorithm development and data analysis. Recently, machine learning (ML) is making tremendous progress and has shown that computers can outperform humans in the analysis of complex high dimensional datasets. Conventional ML application in cell biology, however, is usually limited to fixed cells or low spatial resolution setting (single cell resolution), which is limited in analyzing dynamic subcellular information. To fill this voids, we have been developing an ML framework for fluorescence live cell image analyses at the subcellular level. In our previous study, we established the method to deconvolve the subcellular heterogeneity of lamellipodial protrusion from live cell imaging, which identified distinct subcellular protrusion phenotypes with differential drug susceptibility. Thus, our goal is to advance this ML framework and address technical and cell biological challenges in the live cell analysis. The overall goal of our research is two- fold: i) advancing a new ML framework for cell biological research (technological development) and ii) applying our ML framework to integrate mechanobiology and metabolism in cell protrusion (targeted cell biological study). First, we will advance our ML framework for the deconvolution of subcellular heterogeneity of protrusion and molecular coordination in live cells. This method will integrate time-series modeling and ML to deconvolve subcellular molecular coordination. Second, we will develop deep learning based high-throughput fluorescence live cell imaging. This will include microscope automation, resolution enhancement, and data synthesis, which will build up the massive dataset for ML. Third, we will apply our ML framework to study the mechanosensitivity of subcellular bioenergetic status in cell protrusion. We will evaluate how AMPK reacts to mechanical forces and controls the subcellular organization of actin assembly and mitochondria to promote energy-demanding protrusion phenotypes. Our ML framework will bring unprecedented analytical power to cell biology by analyzing a large numbers of individual cells at the high spatial resolution and automatically extracting a multitude of subcellular phenotypes. This framework can be applied to various areas of cell biology such as cytoskeleton, membrane remodeling, and membrane-bound organelles. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a novel machine learning framework for automated, large-scale analyses of single cells at the subcellular level. By integrating time-series modeling and machine learning, this new system will enable us to identify hidden phenotypes and molecular coordination from live cell movies. We will apply the developed technology to study the interplay between mechanical forces and metabolism in cell protrusion.",Unraveling subcellular heterogeneity of molecular coordination by machine learning,9797909,R35GM133725,"['Actins', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Organelles', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'base', 'biological research', 'cell growth', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'live cell imaging', 'mechanical force', 'movie', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'single cell analysis', 'temporal measurement']",NIGMS,WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R35,2019,232688,0.11388701273613692
"Mechanisms and functional consequences of receptor organization at membranes Project Summary/Abstract The overall goal of this project is to understand the cell biophysical mechanisms regulating transmembrane signal transduction, i.e. signal transfer from ligand to receptor to downstream effector. Using vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) as a model system, it is focused on the following major questions: (1) What mechanisms regulate the cell surface spatiotemporal organization and signaling of VEGFR2? The goal here is to determine the membrane and cytosolic factors that regulate VEGFR2 spatiotemporal organization on the cell surface (i.e. its dynamics, oligomerization state and spatial distribution), and to test the hypothesis that these factors provide a mechanism for the cell to modulate VEGFR2's response to VEGF. (2) How do inter-receptor interactions regulate VEGFR2 signaling in response to its ligand VEGF? The goal here is to quantitatively characterize VEGFR2 interactions with other receptors, starting with the antagonistic anti-angiogenic receptor CD36, and to test the hypothesis that these interactions contribute to the integration of pro- and anti-angiogenic signals. (3) What are the spatiotemporal characteristics of signal transfer from VEGFR2 to downstream effectors? The goal here is to determine the nanoscale spatial relationship and kinetics of signal transfer from VEGFR2 to its downstream effectors, starting with phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K). This will allow us to quantitatively link the spatiotemporal organization of VEGFR2 to its functional consequences.  The proposed diversity supplement will support a new graduate student, Jesus Vega-Lugo, in the laboratory of the PI (Dr. Khuloud Jaqaman). Mr. Vega-Lugo brings critical mathematical and computational skills that will greatly advance the analytical tools needed to conduct these studies. Specifically, he will develop colocalization analysis tools to study various VEGFR2 interactions in the context of questions 1 and 2, and a signal processing and machine learning based framework to link VEGFR2 behavior in the membrane to PI3K activation in the context of question 3. To facilitate Mr. Vega-Lugo's intellectual growth and scientific education, his training plan includes (i) immersion in fundamental coursework and in the literature, (ii) training in cutting- edge computer vision, machine learning and signal processing techniques, (iii) strong exposure to the experimental approaches that yield the data he would be analyzing, and (iv) mentored experience in writing manuscripts and grants and in oral presentations. Dr. Gaudenz Danuser, a full Professor with a long training record, will act as a co-mentor. The Jaqaman and Danuser labs will offer Mr. Vega-Lugo extensive expertise in quantitative light microscopy, a large software repository to jump-start his work, and a highly interdisciplinary environment to enrich his research training. In addition, UT Southwestern has a world-class high performance computing cluster that will facilitate his research. Project Narrative Specialized proteins on the cell surface – called receptors – receive external signals and transmit them to the cell’s interior, thus allowing the cell to respond to its environment. The goal of this project is to understand the link between the organization, dynamics and interactions of cell surface receptors and their ability to initiate intracellular signals in response to external stimuli. The project will particularly focus on receptors that regulate blood vessel formation, a process that goes astray in many diseases, from cancer to ischemia. The knowledge gained from these studies might aid in the design of drugs that target cell surface receptors in order to manipulate cell signaling.",Mechanisms and functional consequences of receptor organization at membranes,9899674,R35GM119619,"['Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'CD36 gene', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'High Performance Computing', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Ischemia', 'KDR gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuscripts', 'Mathematics', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Oral', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'blood vessel development', 'cluster computing', 'collaborative environment', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'light microscopy', 'nanoscale', 'receptor', 'response', 'senior faculty', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'software repository', 'spatial relationship', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIGMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R35,2019,76943,0.06586878691396957
"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease networks are complex interactions between multiple proteins. Precise understanding of the multifactorial perturbations imposed on multi-component networks is a crucial step in the development of a rational approach to drug discovery and personalization of therapy. The LINCS Center we propose will develop innovative computational and experimental methods for understanding cellular perturbagen-response networks and will make the resulting data and new knowledge accessible to the diverse community of molecular and computational biologists, medicinal chemists and clinical investigators through outreach.",Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism,9754857,U54HL127365,"['Antibodies', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Interactions', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'cytokine', 'data visualization', 'drug discovery', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'genome browser', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning strategy', 'live cell imaging', 'member', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'outreach', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'response', 'senescence', 'single cell analysis', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'tumor', 'usability', 'web services', 'web site']",NHLBI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U54,2019,2145158,0.07302996054313574
"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis. In addition to developing physics-based models for diverse biological phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical important tools and algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) a new linear-algebra based algorithm for assessing the fidelity of directed differentiation and cellular reprogramming protocols and visualizing reprogramming/differentiation dynamics and (2) improved algorithms for inferring microbial interactions in the human microbiome from high-throughput sequence data. These computational tools will allow scientists to realize the immense therapeutic potential of cellular reprogramming and microbial ecology-based techniques for studying and treating human disease.

"Ultra-Fast Combinatorial Analysis for Biomarker Discovery Project Summary/Abstract Significance: One of healthcare’s largest challenges is that many patients do not respond to treatment. By recent estimates, around 90% of drugs are effective for less than 50% of patients. This causes enormous physical, social, and economic suffering. The annual cost of ineffective treatment is estimated at $350 billion per year in the US alone. Moreover, variable treatment response contributes to the rising cost of drug development, currently around $2.6 billion per drug. The fundamental reasons that treatment responses vary is that there are many different cell types in people, and cell types vary person-to-person. In the computational world this problem of complexity is called “dimensionality curse”. To avoid the enormous computational burden of high dimensionality, researchers developed deep learning and dimensionality reduction tools like T-SNE, PCA. However in the process of solving computational challenges, crucial biological interpretability is lost leading to a bigger issue: reliability of these methods. Hypothesis : We hypothesized that faster combinatorics algorithms combined with massive parallel computing techniques would make computation solutions for single cell high dimensional data tractable. Preliminary Data: We have demonstrated our approach/algorithm on a publicly available AIDS dataset. Our method produced biologically interpretable, accurate results at an ultra-fast speed (1000x faster vs. current methods) making the approach tractable. The approach was further validated for biological significance and accuracy through collaboration with an NYU Medical Center researcher, who has now joined the team as Chief Scientific Advisor. Specific Aims: This project entails Aim 1 - Building a production grade, computationally efficient and scalable system for creation and storage of all combinatorial phenotypic signatures, including frequency of each cell type, by patient, with associated metadata. Aim 2 - Integrating an automated system for comparing phenotypic frequencies across patient groups, incorporating standard biostatistical analyses and machine learning-based modeling. Aim 3 - Applying our new tool to multiple existing, high-parameter cancer and infectious disease datasets to demonstrate the value of combinatorics over dimension reduction for accurately predicting clinical outcomes at ultra-fast speed. Together, these studies will demonstrate a new computational approach to high dimensional single cell data without losing biological information or interpretability at an ultra-fast speed, revolutionizing precision medicine. Project Narrative Modern technology to measure cells has improved significantly, enabling clinicians and researchers to precisely identify cell types (biomarker) that predict successful treatment. However, data analysis tools have lagged behind, making it harder to use modern technology for precision medicine. A novel computational approach to analyze large volumes of data -- quickly and in a fully interpretable way to predict treatment outcomes - is a critical need that can unleash the benefits of modern instruments and technologies.",Ultra-Fast Combinatorial Analysis for Biomarker Discovery,9846283,R43GM134851,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Commerce', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Costs', 'Economics', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Immunity', 'Immunotherapy', 'Industry', 'International', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Security', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'comparison group', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'ineffective therapies', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'multidimensional data', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'parallel computer', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'single cell analysis', 'social', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,"ROCKETML, INC.",R43,2019,225000,0.05372060409860992
"A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy The purpose of this research is to provide a flexible prenatal genetic testing product that can be expanded to detect any inheritable trait as early as 5, and up to 20, weeks of gestation, from a safe, noninvasive Pap smear. Published studies, as well as our own experience, show that perinatal Pap collections using a cervical cytobrush pose no risk to mother or fetus, and captures trophoblast cells that migrate from the placenta into the reproductive tract. Trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC) efficiently isolates hundreds of trophoblast cells without limitations due to early gestational age, maternal obesity, or uteroplacental insufficiency disorders. In our report published in Science Translational Medicine, we isolated sufficient genomic DNA from intact fetal trophoblast cells obtained by TRIC at 5-19 weeks of gestation (n=20) to definitively distinguish maternal and fetal DNA by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short terminal repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to massively parallel sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal serum, which has a fetal fraction of only 4-10% at week 10 of gestation, the complete genome obtained by TRIC has a fetal fraction of 85-100%, and provides nucleotide-specific haplotyping. In our Phase I award, we developed this technology for prenatal genotyping of single gene disorders located on the hemoglobin B (HBB) gene, using custom multiplex PCR amplification of SNPs, STRs and loci across HBB for NGS. We successfully haplotyped the locus for the sickle cell disease (SCD) point mutation and genotyped the remainder of the HBB exome, which includes alternate SCD loci, beta thalassemias and anemias. In Phase II, we will expand the test to include HBA1 and HBA1 genes (alpha thalassemias) to provide a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy screen. Phase I studies revealed that genotyping was consistently accurate, unless cervical specimen collection was suboptimal and <40 trophoblast cells were isolated. Commercialization will require operators to obtain adequate specimens. We will accomplish six milestones towards commercialization of this test: 1. Incorporate the HBA1 and HBA2 loci into a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy test. 2. Optimize success rates through operator training and innovations in collection device designs to increase cervical cell recoveries. 3. Innovate a novel alternative method to cytobrush-based cervical collection. 4. Automate the TRIC processing pipeline for high throughput cell isolation, DNA purification and NGS. 5. Establish sample quality assessment tools powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. 6. Perform a clinical validation trial to assess test performance. With an estimated annual market potential over $284 million for prenatal hemoglobinopathies testing, the envisioned technology will fill an existing gap in clinical diagnostics and outcompete existing invasive prenatal testing. Our initial commercial product will to enable management of high-risk pregnancies and provide valuable information to physicians and patients in the process of establishing families. Specifically, this initial product will benefit pregnancies at risk of having a child with SCA or other hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and anemia. This research provides major public health benefits by leveraging a safe, noninvasive method to capture fetal cells that migrate into the reproductive tract from a Pap smear for development of genetic tests to identify women carrying a fetus with an inherited disorder. We will build a DNA sequencing kit that can be commercialized to determine the genotype of fetuses at risk for sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies as early as 5 weeks of pregnancy. Advances emerging from the proposed research will generate new clinical tools for managing pregnancy complications to benefit the well-being of mothers and their babies.","A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy",9776011,R44HD092205,"['African American', 'Amniocentesis', 'Anemia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Child', 'Chorion', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conceptions', 'Conceptus', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA purification', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genotype', 'Germ Cells', 'Gestational Age', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Pap smear', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speculums', 'Technology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vagina', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'alpha-Thalassemia', 'base', 'beta Thalassemia', 'cell free fetal DNA', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'exome', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'fetus at risk', 'fetus cell', 'flexibility', 'hemoglobin B', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal obesity', 'maternal serum', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'operation', 'performance tests', 'perinatal health', 'phase 1 study', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'reproductive', 'reproductive tract', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'testing services', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational medicine', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,"CRADLE GENOMICS, INC.",R44,2019,1098375,0.014360581952739539
"Deciphering the building blocks of hippocampal circuits   Abstract   Since  Ramon  y  Cajal,  neuroscientists  have  speculated  that  even  the  most  complex  brain  functions  might  eventually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. Unfortunately, our under‐ standing of the brain's extensive diversity of cell types and elaborate circuitry remains far from complete. For  example, despite the hippocampus being essential for learning and memory and its dysfunction underlying a  wide variety of devastating neuropsychiatric disorders, we still lack fundamental knowledge about its constit‐ uent cell types and their molecular profiles and connectivity, slowing progress towards a mechanistic circuit‐ level understanding of memory formation. We propose to identify all of the interneuron cell types in area CA1  of the hippocampus and decipher their canonical connectivity. We have assembled a strong interdisciplinary  team  capable  of  combining  cutting‐edge  technologies  including  high‐throughput  multi‐cell  patch  recordings,  morphological reconstructions, single‐cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to achieve two main goals:  1) dissect CA1 microcircuit organization by generating a morphological and electrophysiological taxonomy of  all interneuron cell types in mouse CA1 and map their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of  morphologically defined CA1 interneurons using our newly developed Patch‐seq method. Our team recently  implemented  this  interdisciplinary  experimental  strategy  to  successfully  identify  cell  types  in  the  neocortex  and dissect their microcircuitry. Using multi‐cell patch clamp recording, we will characterize the electrophysi‐ ological properties, morphology, laminar location and connectivity of thousands of neurons from mouse CA1  hippocampus. We will also utilize a new, highly sensitive, cost effective technique for single‐cell RNA sequenc‐ ing (Smart‐seq2) to map their transcriptomes and machine learning techniques to classify cells into molecular  types.  Importantly,  our  high‐throughput  method  will  allow  us  to  obtain  morphological,  electrophysiological  and  complete  transcriptome  information  for  single  neurons,  which  cannot  be  achieved  using  other  methods  such as dissociating tissue for single‐cell sequencing. In‐house customization and automation has reduced our  sequencing costs, enabling us to sequence thousands of cells within a reasonable budget. Cell type identifica‐ tion will be validated using morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular tests. Identifying all of the in‐ terneuron  cell  types  that  comprise  CA1  and  determining  how  they  connect  to  each  other  will  have  a  broad,  paradigm‐shifting impact. For instance, it will contribute to a circuit‐level understanding of the computations  that take place in CA1, such as memory formation. From a clinical perspective, single‐cell transcriptome data  will yield a powerful atlas to investigate relationships between cell types and genes related to neuropsychiatric  diseases and facilitate cell‐type engineering.       Narrative  The  hippocampus  is  a  complex  brain  structure  that  mediates  remarkable  mental  functions  like  learning  and  memory, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's  disease, schizophrenia, depression, and temporal lobe epilepsy. For more than a century, neuroscientists have  marveled  at  the  extensive  diversity  of  neuronal  cell  types  that  comprise  the  hippocampus  and  other  brain  structures,  yet  we  still  know  very  little  about  their  identity  and  how  they  are  wired  together  to  mediate  information processing in the brain. We propose a novel research approach that will enable us to identify the  different  interneuron  cell  types  in  the  CA1  region  of  the  hippocampus  and  determine  their  connectivity  diagram,  which  will  lead  to  a  better  circuit‐level  understanding  of  hippocampal  function  and  more  effective

"EFFICIENT METHODS FOR CALIBRATION, CLUSTERING, VISUALIZATION AND IMPUTATION OF LARGE scRNA-seq DATA Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiling provides an unprecedented opportunity to conduct detailed cellular analysis of cell subpopulations. Fulfilling the promise of scRNA-seq for biomedical studies and biomarker discovery requires robust computational approaches to support detection of rare phenotypes and unanticipated cellular responses. Current approaches for imputation, calibration, clustering and visualizing of scRNA-seq data suffer from challenges such as erroneous imputing of non-expressed genes, limitation of linear assumptions in removal of multivariate batch effects, and inefficiencies of clustering and dimensional reduction methods of very large datasets. We have developed spectral, neural network, and Fast Multipole Methods (FMM) prototypes suitable for addressing these issues in the context of scRNA-seq and other high throughput data contexts and propose to further develop and adapt these methods to scRNA-seq data analysis. Our team of experts on data analytics and computational biology is currently funded through the NIH BD2K initiative to develop novel big data tools and methods that have broad applicability to biomedical science. This effort proved the feasibility of extremely efficient scalable prototypes of neural network, spectral, and harmonic analysis techniques suitable for calibrating, reducing the dimensionality and visualizing high dimensional data, finding intrinsic state-probability densities, and co-organizing cells, markers and samples. We propose substantial advances over existing analytical procedures used in single cell RNA-seq studies including matrix recovery approaches for the sparse and noisy scRNA-seq data by combining matrix completion and statistical techniques (Aim 1A), and calibration based on our unsupervised MMD-ResNet neural network prototype and optimal transport theory (Aim 1B). We will develop a variant of the FMM approach to speed up the calculation of the repulsion term of the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique, which will improve our current fastest t-SNE FFT-based FIt-SNE prototype, and develop new reliable approximate nearest neighbors approaches to speed up the computation of the attraction term of t-SNE and other clustering algorithms (Aim 2A). Our additional variants of t-SNE will be further developed to allow better separation between clusters of cell subpopulations (late exaggeration) and better visualization using 1D t-SNE for heatmap gene-cell representation (Aim 2A). We will adapt SpectralNet, our efficient neural network approach, for computing graph Laplacian eigenvectors for large datasets. This will enable computation of spectral clustering, diffusion maps and manifold learning that are utilized in many scRNA studies but are currently limited to a moderate number of single cells (Aim 2B). Finally, we will develop a kernel based differential abundance algorithm to characterize differences between biological conditions (Aim 2C). We will adopt appropriate sampling approaches to significantly improve current methods. This research plan aims at developing scalable spectral computational and neural network tools suitable for analyzing very large single cell RNA sequencing datasets. Specifically, our team which is led by a computational biologist, two prominent applied mathematicians and two prominent biologists will develop and validate scalable and novel techniques for: (i) completing missing values prevalent in these measurements, (ii) removing batch effect, (iii) reducing dimensionality and visualizing very large single cell RNA sequencing datasets and enabling detection of rare cell populations as well as detecting minute changes of cell populations between biological conditions.

"High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure Project Summary The overall objective of this research project is to develop a novel approach for high throughput screening of individual cells based on holographic imaging. To achieve this goal, we propose to implement a new quantitative phase imaging modality, holographic cytomtery, which incorporates several novel technical advances to enable high throughput imaging. Holographic cytometry (HC) will bring the high sensitivity of quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) to imaging of cells flowing through microfluidic devices. While QPM has been used for cell analysis previously, typically only a handful of cells have been imaged. To enable significant application of QPM for fundamental cell biology and clinical studies, it is necessary to move to a high throughput implementation. Technical advances needed to realize the high resolution HC system include use of high speed line scan cameras, microfluidic chips with multiple parallel channels, and light from a pulsed laser source to enable stroboscopic illumination. In order to efficiently analyze and process this data set, rapid analysis software will be developed that leverages the highly parallel processing capabilities of graphics processing units and machine learning algorithms to enable automated classification. The proposed HC method can be applied to imaging a wide range of flowing cells. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we will initially target the measurement of cancerous progression due to environmental toxicant exposure. We have conducted a preliminary study that shows QPM can detect early changes in the biomechanical properties of cells due to arsenic exposure. In the proposed project, we seek to develop QPM based biomarkers of pre-cancerous change that will enable rapid assessesment. QPM has not been implemented in such a format to date and thus is not yet a feasible approach for clinical or research studies. To meet the goal of high throughput imaging with QPM, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1. Develop new instrumentation for high speed imaging using off axis digital holography. 2. Implement high throughput analysis methods based on machine learning 3. Test and validate high throughput system with pilot studies of heavy metal exposed epithelial cells to show the approach can detect early pre-cancerous changes due to environmental toxicant exposure. Upon completion of this project, we will have realized a high throughput imaging cytometry system for research and clinical applications. Project Narrative  The proposed research will develop a new high throughput cellular screening technology based on quantitative phase image of cells flowing in a microfluidic chip. This technology will allow researchers and doctors to obtain holographic images of every single cell in a sample in a short amount of time which can then be analyzed by a computer. This would offer the opportunity to evaluate the characteristics of populations of cells for understanding changes in public health due to environmental factors.",High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure,9732537,R21ES029791,"['Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cancerous', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cytology', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Image Cytometry', 'Individual', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Metal exposure', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population Characteristics', 'Premalignant', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'carcinogenesis', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'detector', 'digital', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'mechanical properties', 'microscopic imaging', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'parallel processing', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'screening', 'shear stress', 'systems research', 'tool', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,194177,0.03453924192697017
"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE Mapping effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing of different types of individual cells, understanding the func- tion and relationships between those cell types, and modeling their individual and collective function. In order to exploit human and machine intelligence, different visual interfaces will be implemented that use the CCF in support of data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, mathematical biology, and biomedical data standards to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimen- sional spatial basemap of the human body and associated data overlays that can be interactively explored online as an atlas of tissue maps. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across the human body along multiple functional contexts (e.g., systems physiology, vascular, or endocrine systems), and connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources as driven by the context or “position” on the map. The CCF and the interactive data visualizations will be multi-level and multi-scale sup- porting the exploration and communication of tissue and publication data--from single cell to whole body. In the first year, the proposed Mapping Component will run user needs analyses, compile an initial CCF using pre-existing classifications and ontologies; implement two interactive data visualizations; and evaluate the usa- bility and effectiveness of the CCF and associated visualizations in formal user studies. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an ex- tensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spa- tial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical. This project will work in close coordination with the HuBMAP consortium to help drive an ecosystem of useful resources for understanding and leveraging high- resolution human image data and to compile a human body atlas.","The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets",9988039,OT2OD026671,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biometry', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Endocrine system', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Vascular System', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'hackathon', 'human imaging', 'interoperability', 'member', 'systematic review', 'usability', 'vector']",OD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,OT2,2019,49496,0.01604107072624738
"High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is one of the most important tools for high-throughput single cell analysis. Fluorescent labeling acts as the primary approach for cellular analysis in flow cytometry. Nevertheless, fluorescent tags are not applicable to all cases especially small molecules (e.g. metabolites) for which labeling may significantly perturb their properties. Raman spectroscopic signals arising from inherent molecular vibrations provide a key approach to detect specific molecules inside cells and to differentiate cellular state. Raman-based microfluidic devices have been reported. However, the very small cross section of spontaneous Raman scattering results in low Raman signal level and consequently long data acquisition time, which is not compatible with the high- speed flow condition. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to establish a high-throughput high-content single cell analysis platform using molecular fingerprint vibrations as contrast. The specific objective of current application is to develop a vibrational spectroscopic cytometer based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process. Several recent advances in the Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) lab, including the highly sensitive femtosecond SRS imaging, lock-in free SRS signal detection and a tuned amplifier array for multiplex SRS imaging, pave the foundation for the planned instrumentation. The PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team for the proposed study. Dr. J. Paul Robinson (co-PI) is a leader in development and applications of fluorescence-based flow cytometer and he will bring expertise to the design of fluidics and multichannel detection systems. Dr. Bartek Rajwa (co-PI) will provide expertise for spectroscopic cytometry data analysis and machine learning. The team will design and construct a SRS flow cytometer by multichannel detection of dispersed SRS signal (Aim 1), construct a tandem system able to collect SRS and fluorescence data (Aim 2), develop spectral un-mixing and machine-learning analysis tools able to combine the information obtained from SRS spectra and labeled biomarkers for functional classification of cells (Aim 3), and validate the capability of SRS flow cytometer for label-free detection of single-cell metabolism (Aim 4). With a speed of analyzing thousands of cells per second, SRS flow cytometer will enable high-throughput analysis of single-cell chemical content which is beyond the reach by fluorescence-based flow cytometer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build a high-throughput single cell analysis platform through multiplex stimulated Raman scattering detection of single flowing cells at microsecond time scale. Having fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering detection in tandem, our platform is capable of discovering new metabolic signatures of cell subpopulations (e.g. cancer stem cells sorted through fluorescent markers). Such discovery could potentially lead to new development of disease-specific treatment strategies.",High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry,9692022,R01GM118471,"['Amplifiers', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Energy Transfer', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nanostructures', 'Optics', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quartz', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tube', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'cancer stem cell', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'design and construction', 'detector', 'electric impedance', 'high throughput analysis', 'instrumentation', 'light scattering', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'photomultiplier', 'public health relevance', 'single cell analysis', 'small molecule', 'spectroscopic data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'vibration']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,388535,0.06763618688140195
"Mechanisms of mechanosensing through integrins Project Summary  Cells sense extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and physical forces applied through the ECM through integrin-mediated adhesions. These mechanotransduction processes play critical roles in embryonic development, normal physiology and multiple diseases, including cancer, hypertension, atherosclerosis and fibrosis among others. However, mechanical responses differ between cell types, between the same cell type in different states, and even in different regions of single cells. While much has been learned about mechanotransduction through integrins, a major area of ignorance is how different types and components of matrix adhesions modulate cell responses to force. The aim of this project is therefore to characterize the mechanosensing properties of distinct types and compositions of integrin mediated adhesions and elucidate the molecular basis for these differences.  A major limitation in our current understanding of mechanosensing by different types of adhesions is that current, morphology-based classifications into nascent, focal or fibrillary adhesions or focal complexes are imprecise, with little information about composition or structure. Additionally, adhesions in cells continuously evolve, so that actual adhesions are often mixtures of different types. Recent work has now defined specific molecular complexes that serve as modules for construction of different adhesion classes. Indeed, the data argue that adhesions have a modular structure with these protein complexes serving as the core modules that are combined and modified to generate diversity. Based on this hypothesis, we will: 1.Combine biochemical approaches with novel imaging and machine learning methods to elucidate the composition and behaviors of the distinct adhesion modules. 2.Utilize these biochemical and imaging methods in conjunction with assays of cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics and tension to characterize the cytoskeletal organization and dynamics for the distinct adhesion complexes. 3.Combine novel imaging and engineering approaches to characterize the distinct signaling properties of the different adhesion states and their responses to substrate stiffness and applied strain. Project Narrative Integrin mediated adhesions sense the mechanical properties of and forces applied through the extracellular matrix. A major area of ignorance in this field is how different types of adhesions differentially respond to mechanical information. One reason for this problem is our limited current understanding of the composition and structure of different types of adhesions. This multi-PO project will combine highly novel biochemical, imaging and image analysis, force measurement, mechanotransduction and signaling methods to develop a deeper understanding of the composition and structure of different adhesion types, and apply this information to understanding their cytoskeletal dynamics and mechanotransduction properties.",Mechanisms of mechanosensing through integrins,9690061,R01GM047214,"['Actomyosin', 'Adhesions', 'Admixture', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibrosis', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Integrins', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Talin', 'Vinculin', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mechanical properties', 'mechanotransduction', 'molecular imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'protein complex', 'response', 'sensor', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,412050,0.043383139925514715
"Novel approaches to study the intersection of cellular heterogeneity and tissue microanatomy Project Summary/Abstract “Novel approaches to study the intersection of cellular heterogeneity and tissue microanatomy” Positioning of cells in tissues is intimately linked to major cellular- and organ-level processes. Appropriate localization promotes exposure of cells to specific microenvironments and stimuli that define their differentiation states and functions. Cellular positioning also determines local tissue microanatomy, as well as the global macro-architecture, allowing for proper organ function and physiology. Thus, understanding the links among cellular positioning, heterogeneity and global tissue architecture are critical for biomedical research. However, current tools for understanding such relationships are limiting. Here, we will develop novel approaches to study cells using currently existing high-content tools, but importantly while also retaining information on the precise positioning of cells within tissues (Aim 1). This will allow us to interrogate how cellular heterogeneity and function is influenced by the exposure to distinct tissue microenvironments and localized stimuli. Further, we will generate novel computational approaches to understand how cellular positioning defines global tissue architecture (Aim 2). For this, we will develop a robust analytical methodology based on machine learning algorithms to study how complex patterns of cellular spatial positioning influences tissue organization and structure. These approaches will be broadly applicable across diverse disciplines of biology for both murine and human (or other species) studies, and will be highly pertinent in clinical settings, such as for cancer diagnostics. In summary, the proposed studies are significant, as they will provide a new toolbox for studying cellular and organ physiology based on cellular tissue positioning, as well as will lead to the development of new diagnostic tools for clinical medicine. Project narrative / Relevance statement The positioning of cells in tissues is critical for shaping both the cellular identity and function, as well as the structure and physiology of the entire organ. The proposed research will generate a novel, comprehensive toolbox for interrogating the relationships among cellular spatial positioning, cell heterogeneity, as well as tissue architecture. These tools will be relevant to public health because they will promote a better fundamental understanding of cellular and organ physiology, and because the developed tools will be directly applicable to the clinic, such as for pathology and diagnostic medicine.",Novel approaches to study the intersection of cellular heterogeneity and tissue microanatomy,9647827,R21AI142667,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Label', 'Link', 'Location', 'Lymphoid', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microanatomy', 'Molecular', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Neighborhoods', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'fluorophore', 'genetic manipulation', 'high dimensionality', 'human tissue', 'imaging approach', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'organizational structure', 'patient stratification', 'protein expression', 'spatial relationship', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2019,264500,0.036520339346668686
Transfer learning approaches for integration of single cell RNA sequencing data from multiple sources Project Summary Neurobiology and Neurooncology are challenging fields of study due to the complexity of the brain as an organ as well as the difficulty in attaining human samples of brain tissue. These challenges have increasingly been addressed by the use of mouse models and molecular profiling that have uncovered complex sets of cell types. Fundamentally all cell types contain the same DNA but can be stratified by their RNA profile. This approach has taken advantage of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) which allows for single cells to be measured individually and for many cell types to be uncovered. In the past 5 years these experiments have become ever more prolific with large numbers of labeled datasets of single cells. These datasets can be used to explore a variety of questions involving the stratification of cell types to the distribution of these cell types in tissue. One of the most promising areas is the use of these cell types to better understand tumor heterogeneity and response to treatment. A promising avenue to leverage these diverse datasets for the study of heterogeneity is Transfer Learning. Transfer Learning is the subfield of Machine Learning that applies information learned from source data to target data to generate more generalizable or accurate models. We will develop methods to combine datasets into more robust models of tissue heterogeneity using transfer learning in both normal and Glioblastoma brain. These models can be used to predict clinical outcomes and study unique cellular relationships between datasets. Project Narrative The brain is a very complex organ with a wide variety of cell types -- the more granular of which have just recently been uncovered. We develop transfer-learning methods to integrate multiple datasets across species and disease states to glean information that will improve our understanding of the brain at the cellular level. We reframe Glioblastoma's genetic associations to survival as mixtures of quantifiable cell types effectively eliminating the “curse of dimensionality” via semi-supervised transfer-learning.,Transfer learning approaches for integration of single cell RNA sequencing data from multiple sources,9683171,F31LM013056,"['Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain Glioblastoma', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Glean', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurobiology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Psychological Transfer', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Supervision', 'Systematic Bias', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'clinically actionable', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'genetic association', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'neural network', 'neuro-oncology', 'predict clinical outcome', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NLM,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,33283,0.10846296462447444
"Single Neuron Analyzer for Multi-modal, Cross-dataset (Epi)genomic Cell Type Datasets Project Summary/Abstract Our project will create a computational resource, the Single Neuron Analyzer, to support the neuroscience community’s efforts to build a reproducible, comprehensive, data-driven atlas of brain cell types. Laboratories in the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network and others are generating large-scale molecular datasets from multiple regions of the mouse and human brain using single cell sequencing technology. These datasets include single cell and single nucleus transcriptomes (RNA-Seq), as well as single nucleus DNA methylomes (mC-Seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq). Each data type provides complementary information about the molecular identity of brain cells: transcriptomes directly measure gene expression, while epigenomic data indicates both gene expression levels and the activity of intergenic regulatory regions such as enhancers. However, there is no computational resource for integrating these data from these multiple modalities and for statistically validating the reliability and reproducibility of the cell types defined based on each dataset. The Single Neuron Analyzer will work within the framework of the Single Cell Portal, which provides horizontally-scalable, highly performant solutions that allow researchers to efficiently scale with the growing size of datasets as the technology for single cell sequencing advances. In Aim 1, we will use machine learning and cross-validation to study the reproducibility of cell types defined by researchers based on one or more datasets. The Single Neuron Analyzer will allow users to compute a quantitative score, corresponding to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), which quantifies the degree to which cell type labels can be predicted based on independent data such as experimental replicates or complementary molecular assays. Aim 2 will build a data integration system that can jointly analyze single cells profiled by different technologies and modalities, including transcriptomic and epigenomic data. We will take advantage of the reliable correlation of gene expression with low gene body DNA methylation and high chromatin accessibility, to link cells measured in one modality with their closest matching neighbors in the other two modalities. The resulting neighbor graphs will be used to impute the missing data, followed by joint cluster analysis and low-dimensional projection of the integrated dataset. Following joint analysis, the system will provide a variety of visualizations and downloadable reports about key markers for each cell type. By combining transcriptomic and epigenomic information, the system will predict cell type specific genes as well as putative enhancers. Single Neuron Analyzer will offer researchers across the neuroscience community a resource for rigorous multi-modal molecular analysis of neuronal cell types, helping to advance the goal of comprehensively understanding the brain’s cellular parts list. Project Narrative Neuroscientists are currently creating large databases of information about the molecular characteristics of brain cell types, such as their patterns of gene expression and epigenetic regulation, in order to better understand the cellular components that make up brain circuits. Our project will create a computational tool, the Single Neuron Analyzer, to integrate different datasets and validate their conclusions. The result will be a system that can reliable and reproducible characterizations of the brain’s cell types and their molecular and genetic regulation.","Single Neuron Analyzer for Multi-modal, Cross-dataset (Epi)genomic Cell Type Datasets",9795063,RF1MH120015,"['ATAC-seq', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Enhancers', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Privatization', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Technology', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'human reference genome', 'methylome', 'molecular scale', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'single cell sequencing', 'single cell technology', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web-accessible']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",RF1,2019,1227489,0.07989660892155616
"Calcium oscillations and cell motility with corneal injury According to the World Health Organization, corneal blindness from disease and injury is one of the top causes of blindness. Diabetes increases the risk of improper wound repair after minor scratches, corneal transplantation, and removal of epithelium during vitrectomy or refractive surgery. Altered focal adhesion, hemidesmosome, and cell-cell junction dynamics are common hallmarks of poor wound healing. Our group has demonstrated increased expression of the ATP-binding purinoreceptor, P2X7 in human diabetic corneas and in a murine model of Type II diabetes (DIO) accompanied by impaired wound healing. Furthermore, changes in P2X7 alters focal adhesion turnover and actin bundling in vitro that may lead to impaired wound healing. We have preliminary data from both wounded corneal epithelial cultures and explants demonstrating that sustained calcium oscillations occur after stimulation and travel between cells for hours. We found that when calcium mobilizations were absent between cells at the leading edge, that lamellipodial protrusions were absent. It is not known which receptor is required for this activity; however, we predict that the oscillations are a result of a highly-orchestrated activation of purinoreceptors. Previously we demonstrated that knockdown of specific purinoreceptors altered downstream signaling pathways that involve cell motility and adhesion proteins.  Our goal in this innovative proposal is to use image processing and machine learning to understand the events that occur in cell-cell communication that induce cell migration in corneal epithelia and to examine how these events are mediated in corneas from a diabetic induced obesity murine model. The proposal challenges the accepted paradigm that the cell-cell communication wave in the wounded cornea is a short-lived on-and-off signal, but that it is a prolonged oscillating signal needed for healthy epithelial cell migration to effectively heal the wounded cornea. As the calcium and motility assays yield large data sets and complex patterns, we are collaborating with a neuroscientist and a computer scientist to utilize machine learning to determine when cells will interact if specific receptors or complexes of receptors are activated. To address these questions, we will simultaneously perform live cell imaging of calcium mobilization, actin and ATP release in epithelium of wounded corneas under normal and diabetic conditions. The aims are: 1. To determine if there are specific response signatures elicited by the sustained calcium mobilizations and signaling generated with injury in control corneas and corneas from diet induced obesity mice; and 2. To determine if the intercellular calcium mobilizations required for the initiation of lamellipodial ruffling are necessary for proper migration? Narrative Injury to the cornea can be both painful and compromise vision. We and others have shown that repair and innervation of the diabetic cornea is compromised. Our goal is to use a combination of live cell imaging, computational modeling and molecular tools to determine the changes in signals that tell corneal epithelial cells to heal under control conditions compared to those under pathologic conditions such as diabetes.",Calcium oscillations and cell motility with corneal injury,9668324,R21EY029097,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Actins', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Bundling', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Oscillations', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Injury', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Fingerprint', 'Focal Adhesions', 'Goals', 'Hemidesmosomes', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impaired wound healing', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Intercellular Junctions', 'Keratoplasty', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Molecular', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Vitrectomy', 'World Health Organization', 'Wound Healing', 'cell motility', 'computer science', 'corneal epithelium', 'diabetic', 'healing', 'image processing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'live cell imaging', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'nerve supply', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'receptor', 'release of sequestered calcium ion into cytoplasm', 'repaired', 'response', 'response to injury', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'wound', 'wound closure']",NEI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2019,247500,0.10682298965521166
"3D temperature control to study biological processes Project Summary Temperature control technology is necessary for a broad range of biologically relevant processes including organ-on-chip operation, biomolecular kinetics, cell growth, studying gene function with temperature-sensitive mutations, cancer cell resistance to hyperthermia treatments, protein crystallization, and DNA analysis. Most biosensing devices lack the needed temperature measurement accuracy and precise temperature control to understand the thermal mechanisms of these processes. For example, temperature variations of 0.2°C can activate heat shock proteins, increasing the resistance of cancer cells to thermal ablation treatment, but reported temperature accuracies are often near ±1°C. This proposal aims to revolutionize the biomedical temperature measurement and control ecosystem by developing technology, models, and validated devices capable of microscopic, spatially resolved temperature sensing and control at ±0.1°C accuracy (10x better than what is used in most biosensing systems). Microfluidics is a promising technology for an extremely broad range of biomedical applications that notably lacks the necessary temperature accuracies and spatial temperature control to effectively study biothermal mechanisms. This proposal intends to impact human health by developing disruptive temperature control tools to accelerate biomedical innovation in thermally sensitive processes. Our group recently demonstrated the capacity to measure temperature at a single point with fluorescent dyes, achieving a ±0.05°C noise floor by using machine learning techniques. We have also 3D printed a cell-based genotype and phenotype assay device with cell growth chambers, monoliths for mRNA capture & fluorescence measurement, and integrated pumps and valves in a volume of only 2.2 mm × 2.2 mm × 1 mm. Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal will build on these successes by developing 3D printing technologies that easily incorporate complex temperature sensing, heating, and cooling channels, coupled with multi-physics/CAD models to rapidly iterate through the prototype development cycle. These advances will be used in Aim 3 to construct a microscopically temperature-controlled chip to measure DNA melt curves to determine the zygosity of a Factor 5 Leiden. This will show that the technology can detect the subtle difference in melting temperature that is undetectable by most PCR machines, as a proof-of-concept before the technology can be applied to other biological process. The overall objective of these studies is to develop a suite of affordable technologies researchers can use to understand biothermal mechanisms to lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Project Narrative The instruments we use to study the effects of temperature on biological processes are less accurate than humans’ own ability to perceive temperature changes. The proposed research will develop improved microscopic temperature sensing & control technologies and demonstrate them by performing DNA analysis in a 3D printed device. Because the technology is cheap and accurate, it will be widely accessible to any lab, increasing our ability to understand the fundamental role biothermal processes have in disease occurrence, diagnosis, and treatment.",3D temperature control to study biological processes,9732034,R15GM132868,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Automation', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA analysis', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor V', 'Floor', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genotype', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Heat shock proteins', 'Heating', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperthermia', 'Institution', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Plant Resins', 'Prevention', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantum Dots', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Temperature Sense', 'Testing', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Thermometry', 'Thermoreceptors', 'Thromboembolism', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Venous', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'cell growth', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'gene function', 'graduate student', 'hyperthermia treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'melting', 'new technology', 'operation', 'organ on a chip', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'success', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,439058,0.019034074396632034
"Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on “manual gating” of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 – Implement a novel computational infrastructure – FlowGate – for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 – Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 – Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 – Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community. Project Narrative Flow cytometry analysis is widely used for single cell phenotyping in the translational research lab to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes and in the clinical diagnostic lab for the identification and classification of blood-borne malignancies. However, the current practice for cytometry data analysis using “manual gating” based on two-dimensional data plots is subjective, labor-intensive and unreliable, especially when using more complex high content staining panels.

"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular signatures of human neurons we identify can be used to provide insights into the molecular factors that distinguish central neurons from healthy people from those of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, SMA, PD and HD. These insights will provide molecular targets that can be used to develop new drugs to block the progression of these diseases which are presently untreatable.            ",Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells,9790982,U54NS091046,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Network-based', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Online Systems', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Scourge', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'disease-causing mutation', 'epigenomics', 'genome sequencing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach program', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'statistics', 'stem cell technology', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,U54,2019,334000,0.08821222879734916
"Molecular and biophysical mechanism of plasma membrane internalization during nonclathrin endocytosis During endocytosis, the cell's plasma membrane is deformed and internalized to bring in extracellular cargo and transmembrane receptors. Nonclathrin/noncaveolar (CLIC/GEEC) endocytosis internalizes glycosylated receptors and extracellular fluid, and is connected to cell polarity development, blebbing, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during cancer metastasis. A molecular and mechanical understanding of CLIC is necessary to understand how CLIC coordinates membrane curvature and actin polymerization to internalize the plasma membrane against membrane tension.  The primary limitation in studying CLIC has been the lack of unambiguous markers for the process. A machine learning approach used in Dr. Akamatsu's postdoctoral lab to classify bona fide endocytic events will be adapted to disambiguate markers for CLIC endocytosis relative to other types of endocytosis. This will define the first unique markers for CLIC and will reveal the order of protein assembly during CLIC membrane internalization, which is essential for understanding the function of each protein. To test the hypothesis that membrane tension controls CLIC progression, Dr. Akamatsu will combine lattice light-sheet microscopy with a calibration method he developed during his postdoctoral research to convert fluorescence intensity to numbers of molecules in live cells. With this new method, molecule-counting lattice light-sheet microscopy, he will measure the numbers of molecules of CLIC endocytic proteins at both the apical and basolateral surfaces of polarized iPS cells, which differ in their membrane tension. He will image the cells under osmotic stress to increase cellular membrane tension. Finally, to understand the feedback relationship between membrane curvature-sensing BAR proteins and actin polymerization during CLIC membrane internalization, he will incorporate membrane tubulation by BAR proteins and their reciprocal interactions with actin filament nucleation proteins into a multi-scale mathematical model developed during his postdoctoral work. Simulations of this model will predict the critical feedback relationships between plasma membrane curvature, tension and actin polymerization necessary for the timely completion of CLIC endocytosis. Predictions from the model will be tested in his own lab by imaging cells endogenously expressing protein domain truncations in the presence of inhibitors of actin nucleation and polymerization.  Dr. Akamatsu has a longstanding interest in combining physical modeling with live-cell quantitative experiments. One to two years of additional postdoctoral training will allow him to fully develop both skills in order to effectively implement a highly synergistic feedback loop in his own lab. Co-advising in experimental approaches by David Drubin and in computational modeling by Padmini Rangamani at UCSD have given him the foundation for this integrated approach. Additional training in theory from Padmini Rangamani and Hernan Garcia, and in quantitative experimental methods from Eric Betzig, Matt Welch, and Dan Fletcher will fully prepare him to lead an integrated modeling and experimental lab of his own. Cells respond to and control the tension of their plasma membrane by internalizing parts of their membrane through endocytosis, which regulates the number of receptors on the membrane. When this process is dysregulated, cells tend to lose the molecular identity of their membranes and become metastatic cancer cells, but the physical basis for this transition is not well-understood. This proposed project will combine live cell three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy with mathematical modeling to understand, on a molecular and mechanical level, how which cells regulate their membrane tension by bending and internalizing their plasma membranes during endocytosis.",Molecular and biophysical mechanism of plasma membrane internalization during nonclathrin endocytosis,9721597,K99GM132551,"['Actins', 'Address', 'Apical', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Calibration', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Characteristics', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clathrin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Development Polarity', 'Dimensions', 'Diploidy', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Extracellular Fluid', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Foundations', 'Gatekeeping', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microfilaments', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Physiological', 'Plasma Cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Role', 'Site', 'Stem cells', 'Stress', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell motility', 'cellular imaging', 'epithelial to mesenchymal transition', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'fluorescence imaging', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'live cell imaging', 'mathematical model', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'polarized cell', 'polymerization', 'post-doctoral training', 'predictive modeling', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein function', 'receptor', 'receptor internalization', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2019,96768,0.02410652203943505
"Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit Abstract Since Ramon y Cajal, neuroscientists have speculated that even the most complex brain functions might even- tually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. More recently, while we have be- gun to understand the wiring principles of cortical microcircuit in rodents at the level of cell types, we are still in infancy in understanding the circuit organization of the primate neocortex at the level of cell types and their connections, slowing the progress toward a mechanistic understanding of complex cognitive capabilities char- acteristic of primates. For instance, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of the primate brain is the most evolutionarily developed brain region that supports complex cognitive processes characteristic of primates, such as reasoning, planning, and abstract thinking. However, we know little about the constituent cell types comprising DLPFC circuit, how each cell type connects each other to form a functional circuit, and what circuit components specific to this circuit endow it with superb computational capabilities for complex cognitive pro- cesses. To fill in this knowledge gap, we scale up a cost-effective, interdisciplinary approach to macaque DLPFC, aiming at identifying all its consitiuent cell types and decipher their connectivity rules, with emphasis on highly diverse GABAergic interneurons. We propose to use multi-cell patch recordings, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), novel and rapid viral GABAergic labeling, and machine learning to achieve two main goals: 1) dissect macaque DLPFC microcircuit by generating a morphological taxonomy of cell types in DLPFC and mapping their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of morphologically defined DLPFC neurons using Patch-seq method, a novel scRNA-seq protocol. We have demonstrated the feasibility and suc- cess of this approach in mouse neocortex, and our preliminary data indicate no technical issue in applying this approach to primates. Using multi-cell patch recordings, we will characterize electrophysiology and morphology of thousands of neurons and map connections between tens of thousands of cell pairs from DLPFC. Using Patch-seq method, we will combine patch recording with a novel/sensitive scRNA-seq method (Smart-seq2) to simultaneously obtain electrophysiology, morphology and transcriptome from single neurons, which can further substantiate cell type classification and identify novel molecular markers for each cell type. We will prioritize our effort on superficial layers of DLPFC, but eventually scale up our efforts to all layers if time permits. At the end, the project will uncover a high-resolution microcircuit blueprint of macaque DLPFC with each circuit com- ponent identified by specific genetic markers. Such a comprehensive dataset will provide the essential ground- work to design molecular tools for further functional dissection of the complex cognitive processes subserved by PFC. From a clinical perspective, having reference transcriptomes and connectivity patterns for different cell types in primate DLPFC will facilitate our understanding of the relationship between disease-associated genes, cell types, and circuit deficits in neuropsychiatric diseases, schizophrenia in particular. Narrative The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the primate is the most evolutionarily developed brain structure mediating complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates, such as reasoning and planning, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer disease. Despite its vital importance, we currently know very little about the constituent cell types populating the primate PFC and how they are wired together to mediate complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates. We propose to use a cost-efficient, multidisciplinary approach to decipher the cell type-specific wiring principles of the monkey PFC circuit at an unprecedented scale and level of detail, which could lead to a better circuit-level mechanistic understanding of complex functions subserved by primate PFC and more effective strategies for the treatment of devastating disorders, such as schizophrenia.",Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit,9802062,R01MH120404,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Goals', 'Guns', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injections', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physical shape', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'cell type', 'cognitive capacity', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'cortex mapping', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'neocortical', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'preservation', 'scale up', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'ward']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,399688,0.04034494532702682
"Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker Discovery in Translational Research with Cloud Data Integration Project Summary/Abstract Cytobank is the leading cloud-based platform for analysis and storage of single cell flow and mass cytometry data, technologies that are essential for investigating the interplay between the immune system and disease conditions including cancer. There are numerous data analysis steps between raw data and insight especially for many single-cell technologies, where the data analysis is complex, highly expert-driven and/or reliant on novel computational methodologies. Cytobank already makes major contributions (1) centralizing single-cell cytometry data, (2) providing data analysis traceability that removes knowledge sharing complexities, and (3) establishing a platform that increases access to cutting edge algorithms and makes complex machine learning methods easy for biologists to use. However, as the amount, complexity, and different types of single cell data and other associated data increases and the number of workflows and single-cell algorithms to analyze the data also increases, the need for open and easy access to existing and new tools and secure, complete storage of the workflows and the resulting data has increased to the point of being critical for supporting basic and translational research collaborations and enabling them to efficiently achieve their objectives including biomarker discovery and development. The proposed project significantly extends the capabilities of the Cytobank platform. This will benefit the community by (1) enabling scalable and secure access to a number of new single-cell data analysis tools that will result in new automated workflows, and (2) enable more efficient cross platform knowledge generation with increased meta-analysis capabilities across experiments and data types. The potential of this project is that thousands of scientists around the world will be able to more easily leverage additional single-cell cytometry, transcript, and other data in their translational research data analysis including automating analysis that has primarily been dominated by expert-driven annotation, thus providing a central repository and knowledge management framework that will accelerate biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Project Narrative Single-cell biology and Immunotherapy are exploding and generating larger and more complex datasets in combination clinical trials. To take full advantage of these revolutions, the iteration and dissemination of advanced single-cell data analysis algorithms (many of whose development was funded by the NIH) needs to scale at the same rate as single-cell data generation technologies are scaling, and multi-omics data analysis and visualization must be integrated and automated. This project will greatly accelerate scientific research, transparency, and reproducibility by significantly lowering the barrier to perform complex data analysis of multiple types of high-dimensional data, providing the biomedical research community with access to powerful tools needed in immuno-oncology, autoimmunity and other high-impact disease areas.",Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker Discovery in Translational Research with Cloud Data Integration,9672504,R44GM117914,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunology', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'clinically actionable', 'cloud based', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'relapse prediction', 'repository', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NIGMS,"CYTOBANK, INC.",R44,2019,652516,0.06496835499776242
"Multi-Omic Single-Cell System for Improved Combination Cancer Immunotherapy Monitoring and Implementation IsoPlexis proposes to deliver a novel multi-omic method for targeted profiling of both the TCR sequence and proteome from an array of 1000+ single cells. Specifically, we will deliver a single-cell, TCR sequencing and protein capture assay for identifying responsive antigen specific TCRs, and concurrently evaluate these T-cells for functional response to that antigen. The challenge remains to link the activation of quiescent T-cell embedded in tumors by combination immunotherapies to patient outcome. Determining the combination of therapies to which each individual patient best responds indicates the best course of treatment. The quality of single-cell polyfunctional response of these immune cells correlates to positive outcomes far better than traditional bulk analysis. For example, PD-1 is upregulated upon T-cell activation while PD-L1 is expressed by a range of cell types. Since PD-1/PD-L1 interactions negatively regulate T cell immune function, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade can rescue effector T cell function. Critical to analyzing TILs is to assess (1) these T-cells’ function in the tumor environment in order to enable trial leaders to predict responders vs non-responders, a critical problem in immuno-oncology, and (2) to understand the TCR Sequence of the highest functioning cells. IsoPlexis single- cell secretion analysis exceeds its competition in the generation and quantitation of highly-multiplexed, single- cell data. Additional single-cell data from the TCR sequence would help to link antigen specificity to polyfunctional T cells involved in patient response, for improved biomarkers and targeted T-cell therapy development. We propose the following specific aims: (1) develop SCBC flow cell for the dual capture of multiplexed proteins and transcriptome on-device. (2a) produce a miniaturized and benchtop automated instrument of the existing instrument for multi-omic applications. 2b) develop a software suite for automated data processing and intuitive integrated informatics of polyfunctional and transcriptome data. 3) Establish patient learning of phenotype & genotype information in multiple trials, applied with machine learning of large patient genotype/phenotype data. At the end of our Phase II grant, we will demonstrate a dual TCR/proteomic assay on a fully-automated miniaturized SCBC instrument, the IsoMini, and software suite that will be successfully used across three combination therapy trials at Yale, Stanford and Fred Hutch. As successes in personalized medicine have continued to move the field forward, there is a growing need to predict responder differences in combination cancer therapies. The challenge remains to link the activation of quiescent T-cell embedded in tumors (TILs) by combination immunotherapies to patient outcome. IsoPlexis automated high-throughput platform using highly-multiplexed, single-cell measurements allows the simultaneous identification of both antigen specificity by TCR sequencing and functional effects by polyfunctional cytokine secretion. This would allow clinicians to finally have a tool to identify the specific TCR of the highest responding TILs necessary for the effective development of combination therapies.",Multi-Omic Single-Cell System for Improved Combination Cancer Immunotherapy Monitoring and Implementation,9847252,R44CA243949,"['Algorithms', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Antigens', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Count', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell secretion', 'Cells', 'Combination immunotherapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Hour', 'Imagery', 'Immune response', 'Immunooncology', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'PDCD1LG1 gene', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Running', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T cell response', 'T cell therapy', 'T-Cell Activation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Antigens', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cell type', 'combination cancer therapy', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'effective therapy', 'effector T cell', 'genotyped patients', 'immune function', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'miniaturize', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'software development', 'standard care', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NCI,"ISOPLEXIS, INC.",R44,2019,996470,0.03972640093042365
"Systems Analysis of cell type differentiation in Xenopus development Summary The pathways involved in embryonic development have been a rich resource for understanding disease in adults, as well as being critically important in tracing the effects of genetic lesions and environmental poisons in the fetus. Frog embryos have been particularly useful due to the large size of the frog egg and embryo. New tools we developed for measuring the expression of RNA at a single-cell level, and advances in protein and phosphopeptide measurement technologies, offer hope for dramatic progress in understanding how signals involved in the maturation of the embryo direct individual cells to adopt specific fates. Our first goal is to define cell types using single-cell transcriptomics, and to define the lineages that result in specific cell types using high resolution temporal mappings. Targeted transcriptomics and proteomics of important molecules involved in specifying cell fate, such as transcription factors, will provide an index of the levels of signaling activity in each individual cell. This will result in an unprecedentedly detailed molecular picture of the factors involved in producing the phenotypes, and their interconversions from the early cleavage stage to the middle of organogenesis. The Xenopus model system allows us to dissect out portions of the early embryo that differentiate to ectoderm if not disturbed, called the animal cap. In the context of the embryo the cells in the animal cap receive a number of developmental signals, including Nodal, BMP, and Wnt. Combinations of these three signals (in different proportions) are capable of generating many of the major tissues. We will expose animal caps to a matrix of these three signals and trace the differentiation pathways that result, using single-cell RNA sequencing. This study of the molecular roots of differentiation decisions will be used to develop a mathematical approach, based on machine learning, to predicting the results of an attempted perturbation of the development of Xenopus. We will ask whether cell types are carefully specified by tightly controlled combinations of ligands or whether there are default states that are hard to escape from (""basins of attraction""), that therefore form the majority of embryonic cell types. The answer to this question is central to our understanding of how the Xenopus embryo reliably develops into a frog, and will accelerate efforts to create computational methods to predict the behavior of other biological pathways such as those involved in cancer. Narrative The complexity of biology makes it hard to predict what effect a mutation or a drug will have. We will use new tools to measure when genes are expressed at the individual cell level throughout the course of development of a vertebrate embryo. This will give us new information on the cell types involved in tissue and organ formation, and will provide an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that we will use to develop a mathematical model of how the decision to become a specific cell type is made.",Systems Analysis of cell type differentiation in Xenopus development,9701256,R01HD073104,"['Activins', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Animal Cap', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm Cell', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Nodal', 'Organ', 'Organogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylated Peptide', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plant Roots', 'Poison', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'RNA library', 'Rana', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrometry', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Xenopus', 'Xenopus laevis', 'base', 'blastomere structure', 'cell type', 'cluster computing', 'course development', 'egg', 'embryo cell', 'experimental study', 'hatching', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'notochord', 'novel', 'phosphoproteomics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'single cell proteins', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'vertebrate embryos', 'xenopus development']",NICHD,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,632237,0.12217143957684935
"Predicting Post-treatment Relapse in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia Using Single-cell Proteomics Project Summary  Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the most lethal hematologic malignancy in childhood, with a probability of 5-year survival at only 60%. Most children diagnosed with AML initially respond well to standard chemotherapy; however, nearly 40% eventually develop relapsed disease, which responds poorly to treatment and is fatal in the majority of patients. Although age at diagnosis, response to induction chemotherapy, and cytogenetic status have been identified as coarse prognostic factors in pediatric AML, it is still unclear what molecular features lead certain patients to relapse over others. Thus, developing an enhanced understanding of the mechanistic drivers underlying relapse in pediatric AML represents a significant area of clinical need.  Many reports indicate that there are rare, hematopoietic stem cell-like subpopulations in AML patients that resist chemotherapy and drive relapse. However, the exact characteristics of these relapse-associated cells—often called “leukemic stem cells” (LSCs)—are a matter of contention, with reported phenotypes spanning much of the known hematopoietic developmental continuum and differing significantly between patients and throughout the course of disease. As such, the identity and importance of these relapse-associated cells as well as their relationship to normal hematopoietic developmental processes remain mysterious.  The proposed project will examine the relationship between single-cell AML phenotypes, clinical outcomes, and normal myeloid development in 60 clinically-annotated primary samples from pediatric AML patients in order to identify relapse-associated cellular subtypes. To achieve this, we will leverage the versatility of mass cytometry, a 40-parameter single-cell proteomics platform, and machine learning in simultaneously studying the complex surface and signaling phenotypes of millions of leukemic cells from patients’ diagnostic and relapse bone marrow samples relative to healthy controls. Central hypothesis: We hypothesize that high-dimensional molecular profiling of primary AML cells will reveal consistent, functional phenotypes associated with relapse-driving subpopulations that computationally align with particular stages of healthy hematopoietic development and represent points of future therapeutic intervention. Aim 1: Develop methods to computationally align high-dimensional, single-cell AML phenotypes with their  most analogous developmental state along the healthy myeloid continuum. Aim 2: Utilize predictive modeling to determine the surface, signaling, and functional phenotype of AML  subpopulations predicting relapse and functionally validate these characteristics in vitro and in vivo. Project Narrative: For reasons that remain poorly understood, nearly 40% of the roughly 500 children diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) each year in the United States will experience relapse after initially responding to treatment. To better characterize why some AML patients relapse while others do not, the proposed project will use state-of-the-art molecular profiling approaches to characterize millions of primary AML cells and their computational “alignment” with healthy hematopoietic development. These data will be used to construct a method of predicting at diagnosis which patients have a high risk of relapse in order to identify prognostically important cell populations that represent future therapeutic targets in the management of pediatric AML.",Predicting Post-treatment Relapse in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia Using Single-cell Proteomics,9758774,F31CA239365,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cox Models', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Event', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Future', 'Graph', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Myeloid Leukemia', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'STAT3 gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'acute myeloid leukemia cell', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'chemotherapy', 'design', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cell', 'molecular subtypes', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'stem-like cell', 'therapeutic target']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,38650,0.06953494116634622
"A Scalable Platform for Exploring and Analyzing Whole Brain Tissue Cleared Images Abstract  The ability of accurate localize and characterize cells in light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) image is indispensable for shedding new light on the understanding of three dimensional structures of the whole brain. In our previous work, we have successfully developed a 2D nuclear segmentation method for the nuclear cleared microscopy images using deep learning techniques. Although the convolutional neural networks show promise in segmenting cells in LSFM images, our previous work is confined in 2D segmentation scenario and suffers from the limited number of annotated data. In this project, we aim to develop a high throughput 3D cell segmentation engine, with the focus on improving the segmentation accuracy and generality. First, we will develop a cloud based semi-automatic annotation platform using the strength of virtual reality (VR) and crowd sourcing. The user-friendly annotation environment and stereoscopic view in VR can significantly improve the efficiency of manual annotation. We design a semi-automatic annotation workflow to largely reduce human intervention, and thus improve both the accuracy and the replicability of annotation across different users. Enlightened by the spirit of citizen science, we will extend the annotation software into a crowd sourcing platform which allows us to obtain a massive number of manual annotations in short time. Second, we will develop a fully 3D cell segmentation engine using 3D convolutional neural networks trained with the 3D annotated samples. Since it is often difficult to acquire isotropic LSFM images, we will further develop a super resolution method to impute a high resolution image to facilitate the 3D cell segmentation. Third, we will develop a transfer learning framework to make our 3D cell segmentation engine general enough to the application of novel LSFM data which might have significant gap of image appearance due to different imaging setup or clearing/staining protocol. This general framework will allow us to rapidly develop a specific cell segmentation solution for new LSFM data with very few or even no manual annotations, by transferring the existing 3D segmentation engine that has been trained with a sufficient number of annotated samples. Fourth, we will apply our computational tools to several pilot neuroscience studies: (1) Investigating how topoisomerase I (one of the autism linked transcriptional regulators) regulates brain structure, and (2) Investigating genetic influence on cell types in the developing human brain by quantifying the number of progenitor cells in fetal cortical tissue. Successful carrying out our project will have wide-reaching impact in neuroscience community in visualizing and analyzing complete cellular resolution maps of individual cell types within healthy and disease brain. The improved cell segmentation engine in 3D allows scientists from all over the world to share and process each other’s data accurately and efficiently, thus increasing reproducibility and power. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a next generation cell segmentation engine for the whole brain tissue cleared images. Our proposed work is built upon our previous 2D nuclear segmentation project using deep learning techniques. However, we found that our current computational tool is limited in 2D segmentation scenario and insufficient of annotated training samples. To address these limitations, we will first develop a cloud-based semi-automatic annotation tool with the capacity of virtual reality. Our annotation tool is designed to be cross- platform, which allows us to partner with “SciStarter” (the largest citizen science projects in the world) and acquire large amount of cell annotations from the science enthusiastic volunteers. Meanwhile, we will develop next generation 3D cell segmentation engine using an end-to-end fully connected convolution neural network. To facilitate 3D cell segmentation, we will also develop a super resolution method to impute an isotropic high- resolution image from a low-resolution microscopy image. After the development of 3D cell segmentation engine, we will continue to improve its generality by developing a transfer learning framework which enables us to rapidly deploy our 3D cell segmentation engine to the novel microscopy images without the time-consuming manual annotation step. Finally, we will apply our segmentation tool to visualize and quantify brain structure differences within genetically characterized mouse and human brain tissue at UNC neuroscience center. In the end of this project, we will release the software (both binary program and source code) and the 3D cell annotations, in order to facilitate the similar neuroscience studies in other institutes. Considering the importance of high throughput computational tools in quantifying three dimensional brain structure, this cutting- edge technique will be very useful in neuroscience research community.",A Scalable Platform for Exploring and Analyzing Whole Brain Tissue Cleared Images,9714223,R01NS110791,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anecdotes', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Source Code', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Type I DNA Topoisomerases', 'Visual', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'computerized tools', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fetal', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'microscopic imaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'programs', 'stereoscopic', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality', 'volunteer']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,335573,0.03235769310350001
"Cell line identification with DNA replication timing fingerprints Project Summary Cultured cell lines have been widely used for basic research to study cell function, as models for disease, and for drug screening. Correct identification of the cell lines used is necessary to make the right scientific conclusions and replicate experiments. Cell lines in culture can be contaminated by foreign cells, which may rapidly displace the original cells. The routine verification of the identity of cultured cells should be performed, but a majority of laboratories do not monitor the identity of their cell lines, and many cell lines are misidentified. Analyses of cells submitted to major repositories such as the DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen) and the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) have found that 15-40% of cell lines submitted by investigators are misidentified. The costs, effort, and time required to confirm the identity of cell lines have been a barrier to adoption of cell line identification as a routine quality control measure. Current technologies for identifying cultured cells are limited, and their cost is a barrier for small scale use. In this SBIR phase I application, we aim to develop a novel tool for cell line and cell type identification using DNA replication timing (RT) fingerprints, which are RT values at specific genomic regions. In our previous studies, we have discovered that DNA RT was highly specific to different cell lines and cell types and this specificity can be exploited for the purpose of cell line/type identification (PLoS Comp Biol, 2011; Genome Research, 2010; Genome Research 2015). A patent for RT fingerprint identification and use has been issued in 2016. Recently, we have applied this technology to identify common markers between distinct progeroid diseases (PNAS, 2017). A novel segmentation method, called iSeg, for segmenting genomic and epigenomic data has also been developed in our lab (BMC Bioinformatics, In Press), which can be used to further improve the identification of RT fingerprints. We propose to collect a large number of DNA RT profiles for a diverse set of cell lines and cell types and develop RT fingerprints for their identification. A web server will be built to take users’ input of RT data and output the cell line best matched with the input data. The web server can also take data of new cell lines from users to allow continually developing our models and database. RT fingerprints can be measured cost-effectively using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiment. Since the total cost for obtaining RT fingerprint for one sample is around $100, which can be further reduced when scaled up, our method makes it possible to routinely check the identity of cultured cells. Project narrative This SBIR phase I application aims to develop a novel tool for cell line and cell type identification using DNA replication timing fingerprints, which can be measured cost- effectively using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiment.

"Turning a sequence barcode into a spectral barcode for single-cell analysis. Project Summary: The use of sequence barcodes has enabled high-throughput transcriptomic analysis of single cells. But one challenge remains – there is no method to map the physical assessments of single cells and the downstream transcriptomic data of single cells to the same cells of origin. This is because currently sequence barcodes are only read by sequencing which takes place after all single cells are lysed, reverse transcription is completed, and cDNA are amplified and pooled. In order to perform transcriptomic analysis and physical assessments on the same single cells, we will need a method that allows us to decipher the sequence barcodes while in the process of single-cell physical interrogation. Our goal in this proposed research is to develop a new method to turn sequence barcodes into spectral barcodes that can be read locally in the process. The proposed sequence- barcode-reading technique, if it can be realized, will have substantial impact to the single-cell community as it will become the only method to map the physical assessments and the downstream molecular analysis data to the same cells of origin in a high-throughput, streamlined format. Project Narrative: High-throughput single-cell analysis has advanced our knowledge in developmental biology and disease origins. But currently there is no method to map the physical and transcriptional analysis data of single cells to the same cells of origin.

"Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases of aging account for a significant proportion of healthcare spending and result in a painful and limiting existence for many tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of people around the world. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that re-purposes known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content fluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced in human cells in which diseases and treatments have been modeled. This system has been adapted to screen for drugs which may preferentially destroy senescent cells, as this may result in improved tissue function and decreases in pathology and mortality related to aging. In this SBIR fast-track proposal we will:  PHASE I Identify a morphological profile of senescence in a variety of human cell types. Progression to Phase II will depend on our ability to demonstrate the power of our morphological approach to identify senescent cells independent of any known senescent markers.  PHASE II Identify known drugs which preferentially destroy senescent cells, without affecting healthy cells, as identified by morphometric means.  Evaluate the efficacy of identified senolytic agents in a variety of tissue function and health-span models in mice. *Evaluate the effect of identified senolytic agents in a murine model of age-associated cardiovascular disease. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I/Phase II Fast-track SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds we identify as a result.

"Finding emergent structure in multi-sample biological data with the dual geometry of cells and features    A fundamental question in biomedical data analysis is how to capture biological heterogeneity and characterize the complex spectrum of health states (or disease conditions) in patient cohorts. Indeed, much effort has been invested in developing new technologies that provide groundbreaking collections of genomic information at a single cell resolution, unlocking numerous potential advances in understanding the progression and driving forces of biological states. However, these new biomedical technologies produce large volumes of data, quantified by numerous measurements, and often collected in many batches or samples (e.g., from different patients, locations, or times). Exploration and understanding of such data are challenging tasks, but the potential for new discoveries at a level previously not possible justifies the considerable effort required to overcome these difficulties.  In this project we focus on multi-sample single-cell data, e.g., from a multi-patient cohort, where data points represent cells, data features represent gene expressions or protein abundances, and samples (e.g., considered as separate batches or datasets) represent patients. We consider a duality or interaction between constructing an intrinsic geometry of cells (e.g., with manifold learning techniques) and processing data features as signals over it (e.g., with graph signal processing techniques). We propose the utilization of this duality for several data exploration tasks, including data denoising, identifying noise-invariant phenomena, cluster characterization, and aligning cellular features over multiple datasets. Furthermore, we expect the dual multiresolution organization of data points and features to allow us to compute aggregated signatures that represent patients, and then provide a novel data embedding that reveals multiscale structure from the cellular level to the patient level.  The proposed research combines recent advances in several fields at the forefront of data science, including geometric deep learning, manifold learning, and harmonic analysis. The methods developed in this project will provide novel advances in each of these fields, while also establishing new relations between them. Furthermore, the challenges addressed by these methods are a foundational prerequisite for new advances in genomic research, and more generally in empirical data analysis where data is collected in varying experimental environments. The developed algorithms and methods in this project will be validated in several biomedical settings, including characterizing Zika immunity in Dengue patients, tracking progress of Lyme disease, and predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy. In this project we will develop new algorithms for biomedical data analysis that will characterize the complex spectrum of health states across various patient populations. These algorithms will leverage the large volumes of data collected by new biomedical technologies, focusing on single-cell data. Specific analysis will be carried out for characterizing Zika immunity in Dengue patients, tracking progress of Lyme disease, and predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy.",Finding emergent structure in multi-sample biological data with the dual geometry of cells and features   ,9903563,R01GM135929,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dengue', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Immunity', 'Immunotherapy', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Lyme Disease', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Zika Virus', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'driving force', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient population', 'signal processing']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,380650,0.03654427749646858

We will utilize Microenvironment    Microarrays (MEMA) to assess the effects of the ME on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation state, cell binding, and motility in each cell line. Statistical analysis will identify 50 significnt MEs for validation each year in years 2-6 in sub aim 1.2.A (total of 250 conditions). Each of the 50 ME conditions will be re-tested with the same endpoints at a second site using MEMA technology to provide independent validation of the primary results. At the same time, the cells will be tested using the 50 ME conditions on a second set of arrays designed to model the elastic modulus of human tissues to determine the effects on phenotypes of the matrix stiffness. From the 50 conditions tested in the validation aims, 30 of the most concordant between the primary and validation sites will be selected annually for analysis by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) aim 1.2.B and RNA expression analysis (aim I.2.C.). The RPPA aim will produce data using 500 validated antibodies against proteins and phosphoproteins in key signaling pathways under each of the ME perturbations. The RNA expression analysis will examine 1000 key genes using Luminex bead technology developed by the LINCS group at the Broad Institute, who will perform the same analysis for us using RNA prepared from each of the cell lines grown under the ME conditions. In total, the RPPA and RNA expression analysis will generate data for 150 different ME conditions under 2 different elastic moduli. All data will be carefully curated, with extensive metadata collected, and provided to the LINCS community for populating the data matrix.         Public Health Relevance: The main goals of the data generation aim will be to populate the LINCS data matrix with unique information that is currently not present in the matrix, and to provide data for generation of cellular network signatures. Our proposal to use MEMA technology will identify unique combinatorial MEs that perturb various phenotypic endpoints, providing novel data to fill in the LINCS data matrix.            ",Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks,9736777,U54HG008100,"['Adhesions', 'Antibodies', 'Apoptosis', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Database Management Systems', 'Disease', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Physiological', 'Protein Array', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Tern', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'high resolution imaging', 'human tissue', 'image processing', 'novel', 'phosphoproteomics', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'senescence', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NHGRI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2019,1714600,0.04434260055073195

"Single cell activation dynamics as a predictor and regulator of aged MuSC dysfunction. Project Summary During tissue repair, many stem cell populations undergo a dynamic phenotypic change from a quiescent state to an activated state. In muscle stem cells (MuSCs), this dynamic activation process is essential for effective tissue regeneration. Despite the conserved nature of these activation processes, the dynamics of stem cell activation and their contribution to disease states remains largely unknown. We have generated single cell assays that allowed us to study state transitions of adult and aged MuSCs during activation. These results support a conceptual view of the aged stem cell phenotype as a combination of pathological steady-states and deficiencies in cell state dynamics. This provides us with the opportunity to identify factors that rejuvenate MuSC function during aging. In this project we will examine the role of physiological rejuvenation interventions on MuSC heterogeneity and activation state transitions. Understanding how rejuvenation interventions control MuSC activation response is critical for the effective treatment of the ever-expanding aged population. Project Narrative Satellite cells or Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are heterogeneous at the molecular and function level. Aging leads to a loss of MuSC function through a delay in activation at the level of molecular and behavioral kinetics. We have developed an exciting and novel project that will identify rejuvenation interventions that activation state transitions at the single cell level.",Single cell activation dynamics as a predictor and regulator of aged MuSC dysfunction.,9756173,R21AG063416,"['Adult', 'Aging', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cell Aging', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exercise', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Exposure to', 'Fasting', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heterogeneity', 'Intermittent fasting', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Muscle satellite cell', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Nature', 'Parabiosis', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'RNA', 'Rejuvenation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Stem cells', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cell age', 'cell behavior', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'muscle aging', 'novel', 'regenerative', 'response', 'satellite cell', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem cell population', 'tissue regeneration', 'tissue repair', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2019,268627,0.07451617658305834
"Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution Abstract The nematode C. elegans is unique among model organisms in having a defined lineage and known connections for all its 302 neurons. The genome sequence was completed more than 20 years ago, but knowing which genes in the genome are used in exactly which cells and what transcription factors are controlling that expression remains a major challenge. We have successfully applied single cell- (sc-)RNA-seq methods to one larval stage and three embryonic stages to measure the RNA content of individual cells across the whole animal. We also have preliminary data that indicates that we can assay chromatin accessibility at the single cell level using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). We now propose to collect both sc-RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data at multiple stages to determine the gene expression patterns of each cell in the worm and the active regulatory sequence throughout the entire life cycle of C. elegans. In turn we will use the combined data sets along with chromatin- immunoprecipitation- (ChIP-) seq data to impute what transcription factors are controlling expression of each gene in the genome in every cell and what regulatory sequences these transcription factors recognize. The results will provide a valuable resource to scientists studying the worm and addresses a major outstanding question in the molecular biology of development. In addition, these data sets, from an animal with a “ground truth” should serve as a platform for methods development in the single cell field. Narrative The nematode C. elegans is a simple animal that as an adult has just 959 somatic cells that arise from a known and constant lineage. We propose to use single cell methods to measure in every cell the expression of each gene and the active regulatory regions throughout the life cycle.

"Function and circuitry of adaptive inhibition in the retina Studies of the visual system face a number of challenges, two of which are the intricacy of the cell types and synaptic connections that comprise the nervous system, and the complexity of the computational processes that underlie vision. Although the retina is one of the most characterized and well understood neural circuits of the visual system, it nonetheless has a great diversity of cell types, connections and computations. The normal function of the retina is to convey information about natural visual scenes, which have complex spatial and temporal structure. The processing of natural scenes has the greatest relevance towards a fundamental understanding retinal function, and the greatest clinical relevance. Yet most studies of retinal visual processing and circuitry focus on responses to simple artificial stimuli rarely encountered normally, such as flashing spots, drifting stripes and flickering checkerboards. With respect to retinal cell types greatest diversity lies in a class of inhibitory interneurons known as amacrine cells. These cells make extensive lateral and feedback connections, and although they form stereotyped connections between each other, excitatory bipolar cells, and ganglion cells that transit signals in the optic nerve, the functional effects of nearly all of these cell types are poorly understood. This proposal aims towards a direct characterization of the functional effects of amacrine cells under ethologically relevant stimuli, including natural scenes. We combine approaches of perturbation and recording using electrical and optical methods as well as computational modeling to characterize the specific contributions of amacrine cells to stimuli that include the representation of moving objects. We take advantage of recently developed computational approaches that can simultaneously capture the retinal response to a broad range of stimuli including natural scenes, capture a wide range of phenomena previously characterized only with artificial stimuli, and that have internal units highly correlated with retinal interneurons. Our goals are to 1) Create a quantitative understanding of the functional contributions of a class of sustained amacrine cells in the salamander retina for specific stimuli including those that represent moving objects and natural scenes, and test hypotheses related to dynamic effects on visual sensitivity and sensory features generated by those amacrine cells 2) Use molecularly defined amacrine cells in the mouse to quantitatively characterize the functional contribution of specific amacrine cell types to specific stimuli including artificial moving objects and natural scenes. These studies create a new way to generate and test hypotheses related to the quantitative effect of any interneuron on retinal output under any visual stimulus. Understanding how retinal circuitry creates visual processing under natural scenes is critical to our understanding of retinal mechanisms and diseases involving the degeneration of the retinal circuitry. In addition, the computational descriptions of retinal responses will be directly useful in the design of electronic retinal prosthesis systems. The retina is a complex network of many cell types, including the most diverse but poorlyunderstood class of cells, amacrine cells. By understanding how inhibitory neurons change neural processing in the retina under natural visual scenes, we can begin to address how these cells and their connections degenerate during retinal diseases, an essential step in designing treatments for these diseases. Furthermore, by creating accurate computational models of the retinal response to natural scenes, this research will be immediately applicable to electronic retinal prosthesis systems that aim to restore vision in cases of photoreceptor degeneration.",Function and circuitry of adaptive inhibition in the retina,9740980,R01EY022933,"['Address', 'Amacrine Cells', 'Archives', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Injections', 'Interneurons', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Methods', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Salamander', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spottings', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'ganglion cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'novel strategies', 'photoreceptor degeneration', 'predicting response', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'retinal prosthesis', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,392194,0.015013198931340163
"Unravel the cellular biophysical dynamics of spatial constraint-induced membrane blebbing and 3D migration using a microfluidic platform and data-driven mathematical modeling PROJECT SUMMARY Plasma Membrane blebbing and the relevant three-dimensional cell migration are vital biophysical processes, which trigger some critical cellular events and are implicated in a wide range of disease. Despite the preliminary success in identifying a key gene pathway and characterizing the basic cell morphology, the underlying mechanism are still poorly understood, due to the lack of effective research platforms. It remains to be a key question how the blebbing transduce the cell environmental stimuli into the cell and drive the cell migration. We recently developed a microfluidic device for the study of blebbing and cell migration. This device recapitulates the native environment for blebbing-involved migration, while providing some unprecedented advantages for investigating the cellular biophysics. We also established a data-driven mathematical modeling framework to study the complex morphology of bleb-like protrusions. Based on our preliminary data and other previous studies, we hypothesize that it is through the polarization of sensory ion channels that the environmental stimuli induce polarized blebbing, which provides the driving force for the migration. To test the hypothesis, we propose to study the blebbing dynamics, using a novel experimental-theoretical integrated platform, which is based on the previously established microfluidic device and data-driven mathematical model. First, we will define the correlation and cause-effect relationship of blebbing dynamics and the cell motility. Then we will define the correlation of blebbing dynamics to ion channel activities and regulation of pathways. Finally, we will assess the influence of the environmental stimuli on the blebbing-related cellular behavior and molecular regulation. The outcome of this study will significantly enhance our understanding towards the role of PM blebbing in cell migration and, in the long run, promote the bleb-targeting therapy. The developed experimental-theoretical integrated platform will also serve as a valuable technology for other cellular biophysical studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Plasma Membrane blebbing, a fundamental and essential cell behavior that takes place in various cell types, can be induced by spatial constraint and drive cell motility in the three-dimensional environment. The proposed research uses a specialized engineering platform integrated with mathematical modeling to unravel the underlying physical dynamics and molecular mechanisms. The accomplishment of this project may facilitate the mechanistic study of membrane blebs and shed the lights on various bleb- implicated diseases.",Unravel the cellular biophysical dynamics of spatial constraint-induced membrane blebbing and 3D migration using a microfluidic platform and data-driven mathematical modeling,9731778,R15GM132877,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Apoptosis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Bulla', 'Cell division', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Chemical Interference', 'Chemicals', 'Chemotaxis', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Ion Channel', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Membrane', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Time', 'base', 'biophysical analysis', 'cell behavior', 'cell dimension', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'cellular transduction', 'driving force', 'drug candidate', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'malformation', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'sensor', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis', 'vesicular release']",NIGMS,UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,435000,0.07350612658140075
"Critical role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells The goal of this proposal is to study the role of transcription factor TCF-1 in determining the epigenetic identity of memory CD8+ T cells. Our adaptive immune system has evolved a unique capacity to remember a pathogen through the generation of memory T cells, which protect the host in the event of reinfection. A better understanding of memory T cell differentiation is crucial for developing strategies to limit T cell responses in organ transplantation or enhance T cell responses during chronic infections. Although it is known that the transcription factor TCF-1 is required for memory CD8+ T cell function, the mechanisms through which this protein controls memory T cell fate remain unclear. Recently, we discovered that a mechanism through which TCF-1 controls the development of T cells relates to its unprecedented ability to create the chromatin accessibility landscape of naïve T cells. We found that TCF-1 is selectively enriched at genomic regions that become accessible at the earliest stages of development and is required for the accessibility of these regulatory elements. At the single-cell level, TCF-1 can dictate a coordinate opening of chromatin in T cells. Moreover, ectopic TCF-1 can directly erase repressive chromatin marks in non-T cells, generating de novo open chromatin and inducing the expression of T cell genes. While our recent data determined the novel role of TCF-1 on the epigenome during T cell development, our findings also raised another critical question: what is the role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells? We hypothesize that TCF-1 in cooperation with transcription factor partners defines the epigenetic landscape of memory T cells. Our new preliminary data further indicate that TCF-1 expression post T cell activation in vitro can lead to gains in chromatin accessibility at pro-memory genes. However, it remains unclear if TCF-1 expression in T cells responding to an infection can create the epigenetic identity of memory T cells. The domains of TCF-1 required for targeting the chromatin and its potential cooperating factors also remain unknown. How TCF-1 dependent changes on the epigenome relate to pro-memory genes needs to be defined. To answer these questions, we will interrogate the effect of TCF-1 and its potential partners on the chromatin state and accessibility of CD8+ T cells in vitro. Using the state-of-the-art tools, we will generate the map of TCF-1 dependent 3D genome organization and define how changes on the epigenome relate to memory genes. We will further translate these findings in vivo exploiting single-cell epigenomic, transcriptomic, and flow cytometry assays. The expected outcome of this proposal is a detailed understanding of the fundamental interaction between TCF-1 and the chromatin in peripheral T cells which can be exploited to devise combination therapies including epigenetic editing to selectively alter T cell fate at will. Our adaptive immune system has evolved a unique capacity to remember a pathogen through the generation of memory T cells, which protect the host in the event of reinfection.

"In situ transcriptome profiling in single cells Summary We have recently developed intron seqFISH (sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization) to multiplex 10,421 genes directly in single cells. We showed that the 10,421 gene nascent transcriptome profile can identify cell types as well as capture the trajectory of the cells. We further demonstrated that we can perform mRNA seqFISH as well as immunostaining in the same cells following the 10,421 gene intron seqFISH measurement. We propose to develop this technology as a potential alternative approach to single cell RNAseq for the HuBMAP to characterize cell types directly in situ in tissues. In particular, we will adept in situ amplification methods such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to intron seqFISH. We had previously shown that mRNA seqFISH with HCR amplification performs exceptionally in tissues in overcoming autofluorescence background and enable robust decoding seqFISH barcodes. We will validate the integrated intron and mRNA seqFISH protocol in the mouse hippocampus in the UG3 phase of the project. Also in UG3 phase, we will develop computational tools to integrate intron seqFISH data with mRNA seqFISH as well as single cell RNAseq data. In the UH3 phase, we will translate the technology to human tissues, with a focus on human mammary tissues provided by Dr. Seewaldt at City of Hope. We will also work with the tissue mapping centers in the HuBMAP program to accelerate the translation of this technology to many tissue types. In the UH3 phase, we will generate million cell spatial atlas of human tissues containing intron profiles, mRNA profiles and protein abundances in each single cell. We will further develop computational tools to analyze for spatial enrichment of genes in the tissue and generate a pseudotime of developmental trajectories using the nascent transcriptome data. Taken together, we will develop a high throughput in situ imaging based platform to characterize cell types and future trajectories of cells using intron and mRNA seqFISH technologies. Narrative Transcriptome profiling in situ at the single cell level has transformative potential for understanding healthy versus diseased tissues in the human body. We propose an integrative approach profiling the nascent transcriptome as well as hundreds of mature transcripts in single cells in tissues.

"Nascent Adhesion-Based Mechano-transmission for Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Sensing Project Summary Tissue stiffness varies along organs and tissue types, from very soft (e.g. brain) to intermediate (e.g. digestive organs) and to very stiff (e.g. bone). Sensing this stiffness by cells determines differentiation, proliferation, migration and survival, which are all important for development. Local tissue stiffening is a hallmark of cancer, sensing of which by cancer cells causes further tumor progression and metastasis. Understanding stiffness sensing mechanism is thus essential for designing appropriate treatment strategy against developmental disorders and cancer. The prominent “sensor” for mechanical stiffness of tissue environment is a molecular complex located between the cell and the environment, referred to as a focal adhesion. The first step in stiffness sensing is thought to involve transmission of increased level of a force across molecules in the focal adhesion against higher tissue stiffness, but the underlying biomechanical/molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The challenge in investigating this mechanism is in the dynamic nature of its structure, molecular interaction and mechanical forces affecting its assembly. The goal of this work is to understand whether, how and when the focal adhesion during dynamic assembly from their birth starts to be able to transmit the differential forces against varying tissue stiffness levels. Toward this goal, we have developed a set of experimental, microscopic and computational techniques to measure a small force from the adhesions, to profile heterogeneous dynamics of entire adhesion population, and to link molecular activity to force transmission in statistically confident manner. Specifically, we focus on a tiny dot-like complex called “a nascent adhesion”, an early form of the focal adhesion, and involvement of the mechanical linker protein talin, given its ability to be stretched and expose binding sites for other molecules like a vinculin, another mechanical linker protein. The overall objective of this proposal is to use these techniques to test a novel conceptual model of stiffness sensing in which nascent adhesions are sensitive to the tissue stiffness by talin-mediated transmission of force, which promotes further maturation of them to focal adhesions. We will determine if 1) nascent adhesions can transmits differential levels of force in response to varying ECM stiffness, 2) the main source of force actin cytoskeleton- driven and myosin-independent, 3) there is concurrent recruitment of talin and vinculin as a pre-assembled complex and whether it affects force-transmission in response to the ECM stiffness, and 4) competition for talin binding of talin-binding proteins against actin-binding decreases force transmission by nascent adhesion and impair the ECM stiffness sensing. An enhanced mechanistic understanding of these processes would increase our fundamental knowledge of how cells sense and respond to tissue mechanics. Thus, the proposed studies are relevant to the NIH's mission, as they will lead to new insights in physiology and pathophysiology including tissue development, regeneration and cancer progression. Project Narrative Cells’ ability to sense tissue stiffness has a fundamental impact on tissue development and disease progression such as cancer metastasis. The sensing takes place at the interface between the cells and the extracellular matrix via integrin-based adhesions, but our understanding has been limited to sensing by big, mature adhesions. This proposal seeks to test whether tiny, newly-born adhesions can sense tissue stiffness by accurate measurement of mechanical force transmitted through them and recruitment of early adhesion proteins.",Nascent Adhesion-Based Mechano-transmission for Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Sensing,9880640,R15GM135806,"['Actins', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biomechanics', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chimera organism', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'F-Actin', 'Fluorescence', 'Focal Adhesions', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Integrin Binding', 'Integrins', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Organ', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Talin', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Traction\xa0Force Microscopy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vinculin', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer cell', 'cellular engineering', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'mechanical force', 'migration', 'novel', 'particle', 'polymerization', 'recruit', 'response', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins', 'sensor', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor progression', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,414802,-0.02504447317436128
"Role of the Snail1-Twist-p21 axis on cell cycle arrest and renal fibrosis development Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) such as kidney fibrosis are global health challenges. In the US alone CKD cost Medicare an estimated 50 billion dollars for patients with CKD age 65 and older in 2013. Recent studies revealed that after AKI renal epithelial cells undergo a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) and G2/M cell cycle arrest through a Snail1-Twist1-p21 axis; these cells secrete profibrotic factors and contribute to fibrosis progression. Therefore these three factors become promising potential drug targets for treating fibrosis, but further development requires addressing several outstanding open questions. The temporal sequence and causal relation between pEMT and cell cycle arrest is controversial, and the respective roles of Snail1, Twist1, and p21 on regulating pEMT and cell cycle arrest is unclear. Addressing these questions requires quantitative systems biology approaches beyond cell biology methods traditionally used in the field. In recent years my lab has made progression on deep learning based image automated analysis for live cell images, CRISPR-based gene editing, and mathematical modeling and other quantitative biology tools. These technological developments position us to tackle the above-mentioned challenging questions related to kidney fibrosis. Based on existing studies and our preliminary results, we hypothesize that there is a temporal order of the three factors, with p21 initializing G2/M arrest, which is reinforced by subsequent upregulation of Snail1; Snail1 also activates, and Twist1 further maintains the pEMT program; due to their temporally varying roles, effectiveness of targeting these factors depends on the timing of treatment. We will test the hypothesis with quantitative imaging studies using established cell lines and primary renal epithelial cells and mathematical analysis of competing models. In Aim 1, we will perform multi-color flow cytometry studies and time-lapse imaging studies on progression of cell cycle, EMT, and other cell fates of cells under stimulation. The two types of studies will provide complementary information on whether pEMT and cell cycle are tightly coupled, and will map out the temporal sequence of events of various cell fate change as well as correlation to expression levels of the three factors. In Aim 2, we will monitor the temporal profiles of these factors through fluorescence protein tagging in single cells, and use the data to evaluate an ensemble of models to identify one or a set of minimal network regulating EMT and G2/M arrest. We will then further examine the roles of individual factors through model analysis and a series of inhibition experiments. Success of the proposed research will provide mechanistic understanding of the regulatory network of cell cycle arrest and EMT in renal epithelial cells. The proposed research is our starting point for an emerging field of quantitative systems biology on kidney fibrosis. We expect that introducing quantitative approaches will greatly accelerate future development of treatment strategies on the increasing global health challenge imposed by progression of fibrosis, which currently lacks effective treatment. Kidney fibrosis is global health challenge with no effective treatment currently. Our proposed research will examine how two fibrosis contributing processes, cell cycle arrest and partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, are coupled. The research will lay foundation for developing novel dynamic strategies to treat kidney fibrosis through rescuing cells from cell cycle arrest.",Role of the Snail1-Twist-p21 axis on cell cycle arrest and renal fibrosis development,9638719,R01DK119232,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Color', 'Cost of Illness', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibrosis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'G2/M Arrest', 'Genes', 'Germ Cells', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Label', 'M cell', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tubular formation', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'epithelial to mesenchymal transition', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging study', 'kidney epithelial cell', 'kidney fibrosis', 'live cell imaging', 'loss of function', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,341955,0.005428391609402279
"Targeting invadopodia-related mechanisms of cancer cell invasion and metastasis Metastasis causes >90% of breast cancer-related deaths. Tumor cell structures that have been hypothesized as necessary for metastasis are invadopodia, protrusions rich in structural proteins (e.g. Tks5), adhesion proteins (e.g. integrin β1) and proteases (e.g. MT1-MMP), known to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.  A novel, real-time imaging methodology that allows investigation of the in vivo metastatic role of invadopodia found that cells which assemble invadopodia move at “Slow” speeds and are seen in perivascular niches. Outside of perivascular niches, “Fast” motile cells, which do not assemble invadopodia were observed. This method also showed that invadopodia are essential for intravasation in vivo.  Preliminary work has begun to determine which aspects of the Slow phenotype allow invadopodia assembly. Use of novel mathematical models, in vitro microscopy and novel computational image analysis demonstrates that whereas the Fast cells continuously locomote, the Slow cells are in either of two oscillating states: i. Invadopodia state, in which a cell is sessile while it degrades surrounding ECM; ii. Locomotion state, similar to a Fast cell. The oscillation dynamics appear to depend on interactions between the ECM and its receptor integrin β1. Importantly, the Invadopodia, but not Locomotion state, is limited to G1 phase of the cell cycle. Release from G1-arrest amplifies invadopodia, implying that G1-arresting therapies may promote metastasis. This project will identify the mechanisms unique to the Invadopodia state compared to cells that only proliferate or locomote, with the idea of targeting the Invadopodia state.  Overall Hypothesis: the Invadopodia state, which is essential for metastasis, requires a pause in both cell locomotion and cell cycle progression. The initiation and termination of the Invadopodia state are controlled by the interaction between the ECM, invadopodia components integrin β1 and Tks5, as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (expressed during G1). Aim 1. Determine the role of the cell cycle in regulating the Invadopodia state. Using real-time imaging of cell cycle and invadopodia markers in vitro and in vivo, this Aim tests the hypothesis that cyclin- dependent kinases and corresponding inhibitors regulate the Invadopodia state, but not the Locomotion. Aim 2. Determine the role of ECM-cancer cell interactions in regulating the oscillations between Invadopodia and Locomotion states. This Aim will provide a strategy based on in vivo modification of integrin β1 activity on how to turn Invadopodia state ”off” towards metastatic prevention. Significance. Invadopodia is suggested as a new candidate target for metastatic prevention. The use of cell cycle inhibitors in patients with invadopodia may be accelerating metastatic dissemination. The long- term goal is to predict and prevent metastasis using invadopodia. This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of invadopodia regulation by the cell cycle and oscillations between Invadopodia and Locomotion states. Outcomes will reveal new invadopodia-related targets, which can be used to prevent metastasis in breast cancer.",Targeting invadopodia-related mechanisms of cancer cell invasion and metastasis,9740417,R01CA230777,"['3-Dimensional', 'Actins', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Biological Assay', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'EMS1 gene', 'Equilibrium', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Degradation', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Frequencies', 'G1 Arrest', 'G1 Phase', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Integrins', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'MMP14 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Metalloproteases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Prevention', 'Proliferating', 'Proteins', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scaffolding Protein', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cancer cell', 'cell motility', 'chemotherapy', 'crosslink', 'cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'intravital microscopy', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'loss of function', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'protease E', 'protein structure', 'real-time images', 'receptor', 'serial imaging', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2019,406153,0.05723893971557873
"Quantitative SRS Imaging of Cancer Metabolism at Single Cell Level Project summary: Although altered cell metabolism is becoming an established hallmark of cancer, there remains a crucial need of new tools for quantitation of metabolites at single living cell level. In particular, due to lack of specific labels for metabolites, there is an unmet need for high-resolution imaging tools capable of mapping metabolites and small molecules (fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids) that play essential roles in pathogenesis of cancer. Supported by a R21 grant through the IMAT program, our team partially addressed this need via developing a multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, which enabled vibrational imaging of metabolites in live tumor cells and intact biopsies at the speed of 5 microseconds per spectrum. This R33 application aims to push the hyperspectral stimulated Raman imaging technology to the next level through (i) technical simplification and validation, (ii) developing a robust hyperspectral image segmentation framework, and (iii) integrating the SRS modality with a commercial spontaneous Raman microscope towards broad use by non-experts. We have assembled an inter-disciplinary team for the proposed development. The three specific aims are: (1) Developing an easy-to-operate, highly sensitive line-by-line hyperspectral SRS microscope and validate its capacity for cancer metabolic imaging at single cell level. (2) Establishing a feature analysis framework for segmentation of hyperspectral SRS images using the non-parametric Bayesian model. (3) Integrating and validating the stimulated Raman imaging modality on a spontaneous Raman microscope. By completing the proposed development and validation activities, we will have generated a highly novel spectroscopic imaging system broadly applicable to analysis of chemical contents of cells and tissues for discovery-driven research and marker- based precision diagnosis.

"Spatial Genomics for in situ single cell expression analysis in the brain Summary Identifying the spatial organization of tissues at cellular resolution from single cell gene expression profiles is essential to understanding neurological systems. We have developed a spatial genomics approach that allows in situ 3D multiplexed imaging of many genes in single cells called sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH). This technology can profile transcriptional states of single cells directly in their native tissue context with up to 249 genes multiplexed with single molecule sensitivity on each gene. We have demonstrated over 15,000 cells profiled in mouse brain slices. This SBIR project will be focused on the design, production and optimization of an instrument that allows hundreds of genes to be multiplexed and imaged in single cells within their native tissue context. The resulting machine will be commercially launched and targeted to imaging or sequencing cores at research institutions. We will design the hardware, code the control software, and build the prototype instrument. We will engineer the hardware component including automated fluidics and multiple camera imaging system with a parallel effort to develop software controls as well as integrated analysis tools. In phase II, we will beta-test the instrument, generate probe sets for gene panels targeting different brain samples, and receive valuable feedback from users and optimize our instrument design. Narrative A major challenge of the BRAIN initiative and international Human Cell Atlas project is to identifying distinct cell populations in the brain within their native spatial environment. Addressing this challenge is essential not only to fundamental biological questions of understanding how different cell types interact to form neural circuits, but also essential in investigating mechanisms of human diseases where small subpopulations of cells, such as microglial, play pivotal roles. We have developed an in situ 3D multiplexed imaging method called sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH), that can profile transcriptional states of single cells directly in a mouse coronal section with up to 249 genes multiplexed in the hippocampus and the cortex (Shah et al., Neuron 2016, Frieda et al., Nature 2016). Delivering this technology as a robust platform that can be used by neuroscientists would enable breakthrough discoveries and treatment options. To make this technology available for a broad range of users and customers, this phase I SBIR project will be focused on the design, production and optimization of an instrument called seqFISH100 and the parallel development of the control software to operate the seqFISH100.",Spatial Genomics for in situ single cell expression analysis in the brain,9730606,R43MH115538,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Automation', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Custom', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Development', 'Drops', 'Educational workshop', 'Effector Cell', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'data visualization', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'instrument', 'interest', 'multiplexed\xa0imaging', 'neural circuit', 'operation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'software development', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"SPATIAL GENOMICS, INC.",R43,2019,265936,0.06536797599217539

We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments.

"Targeting Senescence for Biomarkers and Therapeutics Type 1 Diabetes is an organ-specific autoimmune disease characterized by hyperglycemia due to progressive loss of pancreatic beta cells. While there has been significant progress in understanding immune-mediated beta cell destruction, the role of beta cell dysfunction in the underlying etiology of T1D is less clear. We have discovered that pancreatic beta cells acquire a proinflammatory secretome reminiscent of SASP during T1D in mice and human. SASP beta cells can remodel the islet environment in a paracrine manner by promoting bystander senescence and immune surveillance. We have developed drugs that selectively eliminated SASP beta cells without altering the abundance of the major immune cell types involved in the disease. Significantly, elimination of SASP beta cells halted progression of beta cell destruction and was sufficient to prevent diabetes. In this proposal, we focus on human beta cells and characterize the non-cell autonomous effects of SASP on islet microenvironment and develop drugs that can selectively target human SASP beta cells. We utilize the secretory properties of SASP beta cells to identify biomarkers that can report on the efficacy of drug treatment and progression of the disease. Recent work from our laboratory has shown that beta cells acquire a proinflammatory secretome reminiscent of SASP during T1D and selective clearing of these cells prevented diabetes. In this proposal, we characterize the non-cell autonomous effects of senescent human beta cells on the islet microenvironment and develop senolytic compounds that can selectively target human SASP beta cells. We propose to identify biomarkers for assessing the efficacy of senolytic treatment and progression of the disease to pioneer new therapeutic approaches for T1D.",Targeting Senescence for Biomarkers and Therapeutics,9798318,R01DK121794,"['Address', 'Apoptosis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'BCL2 gene', 'Basement membrane', 'Beta Cell', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Cellular Stress Response', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemotaxis', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Drug Design', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family', 'Ferritin', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred NOD Mice', 'Infiltration', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Invaded', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Natural History', 'Organ', 'Organ Donor', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Structure of beta Cell of islet', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Work', 'biomarker discovery', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental study', 'humanized mouse', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'islet', 'lead optimization', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'migration', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'paracrine', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'repository', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'senescence', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,550024,0.10569600066754073
"Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics ABSTRACT Neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) have been historically categorized into discrete ""types"" based on structure, physiological responses, connectivity patterns, and molecular profiles. Heterogeneity can have other consequences- e.g. recent studies have found that some neuronal types in the retina are more resilient than other types to optic nerve injury, an event that leads to irrecoverable damage in vision. My project combines cutting-edge single-cell genomic technologies, advanced computational data analysis and molecular tools to define heterogeneity of neuronal types comprehensively, to connect molecular definitions to histology, and explore the functional consequences of this heterogeneity during nerve injury. I will focus on a tractable system, the mouse retina, which communicates visual responses to the brain. It is as complex as any other region of the brain (containing ~120 neuronal types), but benefits from having a compact, accessible structure, and experimental tools make it especially suited for detailed analyses. Building on my previous postdoctoral work, this project will, 1) Complete the census of the mouse retina, which will the first for any CNS region, by inferring molecular taxonomies of two of its most heterogenous classes (amacrines and ganglion cells) from data collected using high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using the mouse census, initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, which is harder to access experimentally, but shares important features with humans that are absent in mice. 2) Conduct a systematic investigation of cell-type specific responses in the retina to optic nerve injury. This usually leads to a rapid, stereotypic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but a recent study by my colleagues reported that some RGC types are more resilient than others. Here, using 1) as a resource, I will identify factors, cell intrinsic and extrinsic, that make these RGC types resilient. 3) Selective resilience of cell types is now recognized as a feature of diseases like glaucoma and stroke. Therapies therefore need to cater to different cell types. To learn more, and derive general principles, I will examine the impact of known therapeutic interventions on the survival of different RGC types, and the underlying molecular responses, within the optic nerve injury model. Taken together, my project will derive substantial molecular information underlying neuronal heterogeneity in the mouse and macaque retina and general principles for cell-type selective resilience following CNS injury in mice. The lessons from this work will provide valuable guidance for similar studies in less accessible regions of the brain (e.g. cerebral cortex).   NARRATIVE The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of a large diversity of neuronal types, a major proportion of which remain to be identified and defined in terms of molecular markers so that their roles in function and dysfunction can be assessed. This project seeks to combine high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics, innovative computational and histological methods to comprehensively define neuronal heterogeneity in an accessible system – the mouse retina, and use this as a foundation to (1) initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, and (2) study cell-type specific responses in a tractable model of nerve injury (optic nerve crush) to map the resilience of different cell types, and identify molecular correlates underlying these differences. Our work will create transformational tools to address similar challenges in other CNS regions.","Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics",9650587,K99EY028625,"['Address', 'Amacrine Cells', 'Animal Model', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cessation of life', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Crush', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Injuries', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'central nervous system injury', 'design', 'ganglion cell', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'molecular marker', 'nerve injury', 'neuroprotection', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'retinal ganglion cell regeneration', 'retinal neuron', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stroke-like episode', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NEI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2019,107618,0.05446499553307485
"Formation and function of lamellipodial morphology in 3D microenvironments Project Summary Dendritic cells are the sentinels of the immune system. They patrol the body looking for antigens and then migrate to a lymph node to communicate what they found to T cells and other cells of the adaptive immune system. These professional migrators and searchers are a critical component of human immunity, and their migration is targeted or hijacked by multiple pathogens including some pox and herpes viruses, tuberculosis, and anthrax. Since dendritic cells can activate cytotoxic T cells to attack cancer cells, their migration also plays a role in cancer immunotherapy strategies. Many cells, including dendritic cells, migrate by extending lamellipodia. Lamellipodia are thin, planar protrusions that have been extensively studied for cells migrating on 2D surfaces, such as glass coverslips. Dendritic cells use lamellipodia to find a path through crowded 3D environments and to enter lymphatic vessels. Lamellipodia and the actin network that composes them have been studied for decades. However, most molecularly detailed models of lamellipodia regulation and function were derived from studying cells on 2D surfaces, so we still do not know how cells initiate and extend lamellipodia in 3D environments. Dr. Driscoll will investigate how actin nucleators organize to generate sheet- like lamellipodial morphologies in the absence of a surface to guide their generation, as well as how actin nucleators organize to direct the extension of lamellipodia within crowded 3D environments. As a model of dendritic cell migration through peripheral tissues, she will study their migration though 3D fibrous collagen matrices. Widely available microscopic techniques, such as confocal microscopy, cannot image cells in 3D collagen with the spatial and temporal resolution required to measure the organization of actin nucleators in lamellipodia. However, recently developed techniques, such as light-sheet microscopy, are just beginning to be able to do so. Since light-sheet microscopes can easily produce 3D movies exceeding 1TB in size, interpreting and even simply visualizing such large amounts of data requires sophisticated computing workflows. Although Dr. Driscoll has recently developed computational tools to analyze light-sheet microscopy images, to utilize these tools she needs further training in building and using light-sheet microscopes. The Danuser and Fiolka labs at UT Southwestern are ideal locations to obtain this training. Dr. Gaudenz Danuser is an expert at developing computer vision tools to address cell biology questions, whereas Dr. Reto Fiolka is specialized in light-sheet microscopy of 3D systems. The training Dr. Driscoll receives will enable her to lead an independent laboratory that focuses on how cells migrate through and interact with their 3D environment. In summary, Dr. Driscoll will integrate light-sheet microscopy, 3D image analysis, and molecular biology techniques to determine how lamellipodia form and function in 3D environments. Project Narrative Cell migration is critical to many physiological and pathological processes, including embryogenesis, wound healing, immune function, and cancer metastasis. Lamellipodia are thin, sheet-like protrusions that facilitate cell migration in diverse environments. This project combines high-resolution light-sheet microscopy, computer vision, and molecular biology techniques to study the formation and function of lamellipodia in 3D fibrous matrices.",Formation and function of lamellipodial morphology in 3D microenvironments,9673752,K99GM123221,"['3-Dimensional', 'Actins', 'Adaptive Immune System', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Anthrax disease', 'Antigens', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular biology', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Fiber', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Coupling', 'Crowding', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Diffusion', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Fibroblasts', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Glass', 'Grant', 'Herpesviridae', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphatic vessel', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Morphology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neural Crest Cell', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Poxviridae', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'Wound Healing', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'computerized tools', 'imaging modality', 'immune function', 'in vivo', 'light microscopy', 'lymph nodes', 'macrophage', 'microscopic imaging', 'migration', 'movie', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'polymerization', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIGMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2019,90000,0.0631547699283341
"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE MC-IU effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing, exploration, and download of different types of tissue and individual cell data. The CCF will use different visual interfaces in order to exploit human and machine intelligence to improve data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, biology, and biomedical data standards. The goal is to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimensional spatial basemap of the human body with associated data overlays. This basemap will be designed for online exploration as an atlas of tissue maps composed of diverse cell types, developed in close collaboration with the HIVE MC-NYGC team. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across multiple levels (whole body, organ, tissue, cells). MC-IU will work in close collaboration with the HIVE Infrastructure and Engagement Component (IEC) and tools components (TCs) to connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources driven by spatial context. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an ex- tensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spa- tial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical. This project will work in close coordination with the HuBMAP consortium to help drive an ecosystem of useful resources for understanding and leveraging high- resolution human image data and to compile a human body atlas.","The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector and Meta Datasets",9919259,OT2OD026671,"['Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecosystem', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Organ', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Tissues', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'human imaging', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'tool', 'vector']",OD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,OT2,2019,600000,0.012451770665818214
"Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease SPATIAL EPIGENOMIC PROFILING OF IMMUNE CELL SIGNATURES AT SUBCELLULAR  RESOLUTION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE More than ten percent of childhood cancers are still incurable and need novel therapies. Epigenetic treatments deserve special attention with their specificity and reduced toxicity. Here I plan to explore epigenetic profiles of immune and cancer cells in normal development and blood cancer patients under the mentorship of Garry Nolan for single cell proteomics technology development, in collaboration with Howard Chang for implementation of epigenomic methods such as chromosome accessibility assays, and with Kara Davis for epigenetics studies of treatment resistant B cell subtypes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epigenetic measurements have been limited to bulk level sequencing and ligation assays or limited number of imaging markers. To address these limitations, I will use an emerging three dimensional (3D) proteomic imaging technology in individual cells, termed as 3D Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) or 3D MIBI. Epigenetics research by 3D MIBI benefits from high degree multiplexing (up to 100 markers) and super resolution imaging capability (20 nm x-y; 5 nm z resolution), providing exciting opportunities to study genomic sites, methylated DNA, protein factors, and chromosome accessibility, all within the same experiments in single immune and aberrant (leukemic) cells. To systematically determine epigenetic states, I plan to utilize clonal B cell lines to decipher variability of epigenetic components including chromatin states, protein factors and modifiers by a fifty-marker 3D MIBI panel (Aim 1). These experiments will show distribution of epigenetic factors (linear or log-scale) in their expression levels and spatial variations (global or local) in the chromatin states. I will then perform experiments with primary B cells isolated from six different bone marrow aspirates of normal human subjects (Aim 2). I will correlate epigenetic signatures of each B cell subtype to corresponding development state (progenitor, pre, post, or mature). I will then perform an ex vivo co-culture of primary B cells on OP9 stromal cells over 1-6 weeks of culturing, which will be followed by fixation and profiling by 3D MIBI. These perturbation experiments will show how signaling events from neighboring cells drive necessary epigenetic conditions that are required for reaching a B cell subset. Finally, I will turn to primary B cells that are isolated from twenty newly diagnosed ALL patients (Aim 3). I will dissect differentiation and spatial epigenomic remodeling of responder B cell subsets and treatment resistant B cell subtypes from bone marrow aspirates using the OP9 co-culture. These will show how treatment resistance arises from a single epigenetic state or multiple distinct epigenetic signatures. I will then screen Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on the same co-culture of B cell subtypes from ALL and stromal cells. By varying concentration and duration of inhibition conditions, I will dissect the role of epigenetic drugs in spatial chromatin remodeling toward development of epigenetic therapies in ALL. Together, these experiments will shed light on the role of epigenetic programming for cancer treatment applications from immune cell signatures in normal subjects and blood cancer patients. Public Health Relevance: Epigenetic alterations in immune and cancer cells regulate normal development and aberrant formation in humans. We reveal spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes in epigenetic states of B cell subtypes from healthy and diseased subjects using a novel multiplex imaging mass cytometry. Deciphering the role of epigenetic perturbations in treatment resistant B cells will guide development of efficient and safe epigenetic therapies for pediatric blood cancers.",Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease,9725907,K25AI140783,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Aspirate substance', 'Attention', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood Hematopoietic Neoplasm', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Cytometry', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Four-dimensional', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Libraries', 'Ligation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Technology', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'chromatin remodeling', 'design', 'epigenetic drug', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging capabilities', 'lymphoblast', 'mathematical analysis', 'multiplexed\xa0imaging', 'nanometer', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pediatric patients', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'sample fixation', 'shape analysis', 'single cell analysis', 'success', 'technology development', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K25,2019,26384,-0.009073280142545975
"Multiscale Resolution and Deep Network Approaches for Deconvolving Different Cell Types in Bulk Tumor using Single-cell Sequencing Data (scDEC) Abstract: Tumors are complex ecosystems composed of heterogeneous cell populations. Understanding the clonal cellular composition of the tumor and the non-malignant cells within the tumor ecosystem provides significant insights in the tumor recurrence, treatment, initiation, progression and metastasis. Previous studies estimated immune cell type content in bulk tumor expression data using immune cell signatures generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, with the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing methods, we can now also estimate the tumor associated non-malignant and malignant cell type contents.  In this proposal, we describe a novel deep net approach for deconvolving different cell types in bulk tumor using single-cell sequencing data (scDEC). We will also infer tumor associated copy number variation (CNV) clones and their signatures from single-cell RNA sequencing data using our novel multiscale resolution signal processing based algorithm. Our approach will estimate not only the content of different immune cell types and tumor associated non-malignant cell types but also the content of different CNV clone types in bulk tumor. Moreover, we will discover new associations between cell type content and sample phenotype such as disease survival, subtype and outcome. Our proposed project will lead to major improvements in clinical care to guide the treatment and prognosis of various types of cancer. Narrative Here we describe a novel multiscale resolution and deep net based approaches for deconvolving different cell types in bulk tumor using single cell RNA sequencing data (scDEC). Using our scDEC algorithm, we will identify novel associations between different cell type contents including immune cell, non-malignant tumor associated cell and CNV clone type contents and sample phenotypes such as disease survival.

"Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data Project Summary Understanding how genes' activities are controlled is crucial for elucidating the basic operating rules of biology and molecular mechanisms of diseases. Recent innovations in single-cell genomic technologies have opened the door to analyzing a variety of functional genomic features in individual cells. These technologies enable scientists to systematically discover unknown cell subpopulations in complex tissue and disease samples, and allow them to reconstruct a sample's gene regulatory landscape at an unprecedented cellular resolution. Despite these promising developments, many challenges still exist and must be overcome before one can fully decode gene regulation at the single-cell resolution. In particular, current technologies lack the ability to accurately measure the activity of each individual cis-regulatory element (CRE) in a single cell. They also cannot measure all functional genomic data types in the same cell. Moreover, the prevalent technical biases and noises in single-cell genomic data make computational analysis non-trivial. With rapid growth of data, lack of computational tools for data analysis has become a rate-limiting factor for effective applications of single-cell genomic technologies.  The objective of this proposal is to develop computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory landscape using single-cell genomic data. Our Aim 1 addresses the challenge of accurately measuring CRE activities in single cells using single-cell regulome data. Regulome, deﬁned as the activities of all cis-regulatory elements in a genome, contains crucial information for understanding gene regulation. The state-of-the-art technologies for mapping regulome in a single cell produce sparse data that cannot accurately measure activities of individual CREs. We will develop a new computational framework to allow more accurate analysis of individual CREs' activities in single cells using sparse data. Our Aim 2 addresses the challenge of collecting multiple functional genomic data types in the same cell. We will develop a method that uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the most widely used single-cell functional genomic technology, to predict cells' regulatory landscape. Since most scRNA-seq datasets do not have accompanying single-cell data for other -omics data types, our method will also signiﬁcantly expand the utility and increase the value of scRNA- seq experiments. Our Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating different data types generated by different single-cell genomic technologies from different cells. We will develop a method to align single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell regulome data to generate an integrated map of transcriptome and regulome.  Upon completion of this proposal, we will deliver our methods through open-source software tools. These tools will be widely useful for analyzing and integrating single-cell regulome and transcriptome data. By addressing several major challenges in single-cell genomics, our new methods and tools will help unleash the full potential of single-cell genomic technologies for studying gene regulation. As such, they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases. Project Narrative Understanding how genes' activities are controlled at single-cell resolution is crucial for studying human diseases. This proposal will develop a coordinated set of computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory programs using single-cell genomic data. These methods and tools will allow scientists to more accurately and comprehensively reconstruct gene regulatory landscape of individual cells in complex tissue and disease samples, and they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases.",Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data,9649896,R01HG010889,"['Address', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stem Cell Development', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transposase', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,409375,0.09610026093705507
"Continuous Probing of Nanoconstruct-Cell Interactions at Biologically Relevant Time Scales PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal aims to develop live-cell, multi-channel imaging tools that can visualize—continuously, and in real time—nanoparticle interactions with cellular components. We will focus on several different time windows, where early time periods will monitor nanoparticle-cell membrane binding and uptake and later times will track endosomal accumulation and escape. The ability to resolve temporally and spatially how particle size/shape and ligand density affects interactions in 3D is critical for determining structure-activity-relationships and mechanism of action in live cells. To characterize interactions of functional nanoparticles with different cellular structures at physiologically relevant times, we propose to design a multi-channel optical microscope integrated with an opto- splitter and custom live-cell imaging chamber. Simultaneous images can be acquired in different channels of the fluorescence of dye-labeled organelles and dye-labeled ligands on the particles as well as differential interference contrast (DIC) signals of whole cells, cellular components, and nanoparticle cores. Correlation of structural and functional images provides a powerful window into how local nanoconstruct interactions can mediate a biological response. For model systems, we will compare gold nanoconstructs with oligonucleotide ligand shells of both targeting (DNA aptamers) or non-targeting (siRNA) properties. Nanoparticle shape enables a unique handle to probe rotation and orientation of intracellular particle interactions. This work can bridge a gap in understanding the behavior of nanoconstructs intracellularly and how the integrity and presentation of oligonucleotides in ligand shells affects targeting and other processes such as endosomal escape, which is critical to assess therapeutic efficacy. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  This proposal aims to design tools that can visualize nanoparticle interactions with cells at distinct time points with biological relevance. Our ultimate goal is to evaluate how nanoconstructs interact with cellular membranes and sub-cellular components. Such results may impact how nanoparticle shape and ligand density can inform design of particle-based drug delivery agents.",Continuous Probing of Nanoconstruct-Cell Interactions at Biologically Relevant Time Scales,9819558,R01GM131421,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Dyes', 'Endosomes', 'Environment', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorescence', 'Functional Imaging', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immune response', 'Label', 'Ligands', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Multiple Partners', 'Nomarski Interference Contrast Microscopy', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Particle Size', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'live cell imaging', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'nanoparticle', 'nanoparticle drug', 'nanoprobe', 'nanoscale', 'optical imaging', 'particle', 'plasmonics', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIGMS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,267708,0.040705104305932084
"Niche signals in HSC genesis PROJECT SUMMARY Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have well established clinical applications in the treatment of heritable and acquired blood disorders. However, their therapeutic potential could be significantly broadened by engineering novel methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells or from directly reprogrammed adult cells. Toward this goal, we have established endothelial cell (EC) niche based culture methods that provide the necessary conditions to support the specification and self-renewal of HSC from embryonic hemogenic precursors, and more recently, from adult ECs using transcription factor (TF)-mediated conversion that bypasses a pluripotent intermediate. We hypothesize that recreating the signals necessary and sufficient to develop a clinically meaningful system for HSC generation in vitro will necessitate a comprehensive, systems approach to deconstruct the niche provided signals required for HSC specification and self-renewal. Thus, the overall goal of this grant is to leverage unique expertise of the collaborating laboratories to elucidate the signaling interactions regulating HSC specification and self-renewal from embryonic hemogenic precursors or TF-reprogrammed adult EC in the context of the EC niche. Our approach consists of three overlapping aims. The first aim will identify EC niche-provided signals necessary for embryonic HSC specification and self-renewal. The second aim will identify the unique HSC programs induced by these signals that regulate the transition from embryonic hemogenic precursor to bone fide repopulating HSC. The third will identify comparable programs that regulate the transition from adult EC to HSC during TF-mediated reprogramming in the EC niche. Key to these studies will be innovative functional assays, transcriptional profiling methods, and computational approaches that will enable us to resolve cellular complexity of niche cells and their interactions with developing embryonic or reprogrammed HSC at the single cell level. The role of identified signal factors in stage-specific support of HSC specification will be validated and further refined in vitro by gain and loss of function studies in the context of niche EC. Furthermore, to extend these studies to stromal cell-free systems as a step toward clinical translation, we will also test the contribution of identified signal factors in HSC specification and self-renewal in the context of stage-specific modulation of Notch activation using engineered Notch agonists. To achieve the goals of this proposal, we have developed a multidisciplinary collaboration involving unique expertise in each of our laboratories, including basic HSC and EC niche cell biology, direct TF based cellular conversion, clinical HSC transplantation, genome wide assessment of rare stem cell populations at single cell resolution, and innovative computational approaches to deconstruct core signal pathways regulating developmental transitions. Altogether, we expect the proposed studies will ultimately guide the design of novel strategies for deriving and expanding HSC in vitro for therapeutic applications. NARRATIVE Hematopoietic stem cells are currently used in the treatment and cure of a variety of blood disorders. Methods to generate new or greater numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in the laboratory could expand the availability and therapeutic applications of these valuable cells, but currently such methods are lacking. The goal of this proposal is to use lessons from endothelial cells, which provide critical signals to support hematopoietic stem cells, to engineer novel systems for the development and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in culture. !",Niche signals in HSC genesis,9736697,RC2DK114777,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Agonist', 'Aorta', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Development', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gonadal structure', 'Grant', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Specification', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Mediating', 'Mesonephric structure', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological Processes', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Stem Cell Development', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'base', 'blastomere structure', 'bone', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome-wide', 'hematopoietic stem cell expansion', 'hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'machine learning algorithm', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'receptor', 'self-renewal', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem', 'stem cell population', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,RC2,2019,642675,0.10102801569027012
"Fluorescence tomography plugin unit for spatial monitoring of T cell migration Immunotherapy (IMT) is a cancer treatment that harnesses activated T cells to induce a targeted immune response against the cancer. Preclinical IMT research has been limited because there are no effective methods to longitudinally image T cell biodistribution in mouse models, including ovarian cancer. This is an urgent unmet need because the only viable methods to monitor activated T cells, the immune marker most associated with antitumor response and prognosis, immunohistochemistry and FACs, are both terminal and ex vivo. Fluorescence imaging (FLi) offers many advantages for monitoring T cell migration, including the relatively long photostability of fluorescent ligands, ease of use, and its low cost. However, FLi does not provide 3D spatial maps of fluorescent reporters due to diffuse light propagation in animal tissue. In addition, fluorescence intensities on the tissue surface also depend on the animal’s size, pose, and shape and, hence, limit quantification and reproducibility. Last, there is no anatomical reference that also provides a template for automated organ delineation along with T cell biodistribution analysis. Therefore, InVivo Analytics seeks funding to develop InVivoFLUOR, an automated data analysis tool for 3D fluorescence tomography (FLt) of mouse models. InVivoFLUOR is comprised of: a Body Conforming Animal Mold (BCAM) for multi-source transillumination FLt and spatial registration of the animal’s geometry and pose; an Organ Probability Map (OPM) for providing an organ template; and a cloud-based FLt algorithm. We will demonstrate its feasibility on an IMT example for determining the spatial biodistribution of fluorescence-labeled T cells and, in combination with bioluminescence imaging (BLi), will compare localization of ovarian cancer cells. In Aim 1 we will confirm the ability to quantitatively determine fluorescent targets inside a small animal. The spatial distribution of known fluorescent targets will be reconstructed and compared to ex vivo data. In Aim 2 we will confirm the ability to determine the in vivo T cell biodistribution at tumor sites. The fluorescence-labeled T cell distribution will be calculated and coregistered to the anatomy based on the OPM and to disseminated ovarian tumors. The ability to instantaneously quantify the T cell distribution in the same animal longitudinally, as opposed to sacrificing a different animal at every time point for T cell counting via FACS or histology, neither of which can identify sites where the activated T cells may be “hiding”, has an impact on the development of and outcome of new IMTs with high accuracy. InVivoFLUOR will enable cross-platform data comparison and analysis, eliminate operator-dependent variability, increase data reproducibility, and will facilitate the translation of new therapeutics. The successful completion of the proposed project will help to commercialize InVivoFLUOR and will find immediate application in the pharmaceutical industry for rapid development of novel IMTs. InVivo Analytics seeks funding for demonstrating the feasibility for mapping the 3D spatial biodistribution of fluorescent T cells in a small animal model of ovarian cancer. Analysis of T cell migration currently lacks the ability to obtain 3D spatial maps of T cells in the same animal in longitudinal studies. Therefore, InVivo Analytics will develop a 3D fluorescence tomography and data analysis tool, which can quantify T cell migration in the living animal, thereby allowing accurate monitoring of novel immunotherapies.",Fluorescence tomography plugin unit for spatial monitoring of T cell migration,9846612,R43CA243827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antitumor Response', 'Atlases', 'Attenuated', 'Biodistribution', 'Bioluminescence', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Drug Industry', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histology', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunotherapy', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Molds', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Radioisotopes', 'Radiolabeled', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transillumination', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'animal tissue', 'base', 'bioluminescence imaging', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell motility', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'digital', 'fluorescence imaging', 'fluorophore', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optical imaging', 'outcome forecast', 'ovarian neoplasm', 'pre-clinical', 'serial imaging', 'tomography', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,"IN VIVO ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2019,222435,0.05478381476693503
"The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease Most investigations of craniosynostosis focus on the dermatocranium, the second cranial skeleton to form during embryogenesis that comprises the dermal bones of the cranial vault and facial skeleton. A completely separate cranial skeleton, the chondrocranium, develops before the dermatocranium to support the embryonic brain and other sense organs. Historically, the chondrocranium has been studied across the vertebrates and is recognized as fundamental to craniofacial development, but it is not well known to craniofacial biologists and has never been studied in the laboratory mouse until now. The chondrocranium is formed of cartilage and though parts of it ossify endochondrally, other portions begin to degenerate by about embryonic day 15-16 in the mouse. By careful analysis of whole mount and histological specimens, we have documented the synchronized deterioration of select chondrocranial elements with the appearance and superimposition of particular dermal bones of the growing dermatocranium. These observations signal the existence of a mechanism for the coordinated, localized expansion (dermal bones) and resorption (cartilage) of two developmentally and evolutionarily separate skeletal systems. Our project, supported by strong preliminary data of the mouse chondrocranium, is designed to test a central hypothesis: that the chondrocranium serves as a structural and functional scaffold for the later development of dermatocranial elements including the formation of cranial vault sutures. Based on the common finding that boundaries between different cell populations often serve as tissue organizers, we recognize the establishment and maintenance of stable boundaries that restrict the mixing of different cell populations as critical to proper development, and propose a research design that interrogates the chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundary as significant to the coordinated development of the skull. We will interrogate cells at specific sites to determine the processes that function to maintain the boundaries. Then using the Fgfr2c+/C342Y mouse model for craniosynostosis, we will investigate relevant chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundaries operative in the development of two craniosynostosis phenotypes: premature closure of the coronal suture and abnormal growth of the midface. That the chondrocranium is composed of irregularly shaped cartilages, many of which are short-lived, requires that we conceive new tools for analysis. We will complete development of an innovative system to dissect and reconstruct the chondrocranium in silico from micro computed tomography images with tight temporal control, precisely delineate chondrocranial anatomy in 3D over embryonic time, and establish the role of the chondrocranium in development of the dermatocranium. Achieving our goals will enrich textbook knowledge of craniofacial development by defining the role of the chondrocranium in the production of dermatocranial phenotypes, provide information relative to the pathophysiology of countless craniofacial anomalies, and reveal potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. Craniofacial anomalies are common birth defects that require comprehensive, sometimes repetitive corrective surgeries to manage individual cases. To ameliorate the financial and emotional burden on patients and their families, efforts are aimed at the development of preventative therapies but these require a thorough understanding of craniofacial development. We offer novel information about the chondrocranium, the first embryonic cranial skeleton to develop, and focus on mechanisms operating within boundaries between it and the dermatocranium that are critical to craniofacial development, in normal individuals and in craniofacial disease.",The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease,9657003,R01DE027677,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Apert-Crouzon syndrome', 'Apoptosis', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Birth', 'Bone Resorption', 'Brain', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Chondrichthyes', 'Chondrocranium', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Embryonic Structures', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory mice', 'Live Birth', 'Maintenance', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Osteoblasts', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sense Organs', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal system', 'Skeleton', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vertebrates', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cleft lip and palate', 'coronal suture', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fibroblast growth factor receptor 2c', 'histological specimens', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'osteogenic', 'premature', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIDCR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2019,523782,0.016074240444968142
"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Human Retina PROJECT SUMMARY Vision, the most important of the human senses, occupies 25% of the brain function. It requires an orchestrated coordination between all parts of the eye. Of all the parts, the retina is the most vital for normal perception of an image. It is a precisely layered structure lining the surface of the back of the eye, comprising many millions of cells packed together in a tightly knit network. The optic nerve connects the retina with the brain. The retina not only receives light, but also processes it, and transmits downstream signals to the midbrain and the thalamus. When the retina becomes diseased, the unfortunate result is blindness, which is the most feared disability. Diseases that affect the retina are complex because of the diverse number of cell types and total number of cells involved. It remains challenging to assess if pathological phenotypes affect diverse cell populations versus highly specific cell types. While advances in retinal disease diagnostics have progressed rapidly, treatments for retinal diseases directed at primary genetic defects have progressed slowly. Despite major successes in genetics, the vision community is lagging behind the advances in precision medicine occurring in other specialties. Modest progress is due in part to an incomplete understanding of human retinal biology. Anatomical differences between humans and commonly used animal models have severely hindered the translation of results from laboratory to human health. Therefore, there is an urgent need to collect and analyze retinal cells from human eyes to advance our understanding of human retinal diseases and assess the cell type conservation between mouse and human. Recent technologic breakthroughs in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) have made it possible to measure gene expression in single cells, paving the way for exploring cellular heterogeneity. Collaborating with the Alabama Eye Bank, we will deeply sample human retinal cells, fully characterize cell diversity, and elucidate the functional roles of findings from genome- wide association studies for retinal diseases. We propose the following aims. Aim 1 will generate scRNA-seq data from eyes of 20 healthy adult human donors, and produce de-noised gene expression data for downstream analyses. Aim 2 will characterize cell diversity in human retina and supporting tissues, and validate novel cell type-specific marker genes by immunohistochemistry. Aim 3 will infer cell type compositions and allele-specific gene expression in each cell type by integrating scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data from normal human eyes. These pioneering studies leverage novel methods and interdisciplinary expertise to characterize cell type-specific gene expression in human retina and supporting tissues. By detailed characterization of the cell atlases in four geographical areas in human eye, our study will provide novel insights into cell-type specific functions that can power precision therapeutic targeting of retinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE The retina is the most vital for normal perception of an image in the eye. Diseases that affect the retina are complex, and it remains challenging to assess if pathological phenotypes originate in diverse cell populations or highly specific cell types.

"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease. Computational methods that can identify regulatory networks and their dynamics across related mammalian cell types offer a powerful approach to create better models of human disease and for regenerative medicine.",Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages,9729760,R01GM117339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Distal', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Maintenance', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signaling Protein', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Validation', 'cell fate specification', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human model', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'multi-task learning', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'promoter', 'reconstruction', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,303220,0.0557937586473777
"The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus The cochlear nucleus is the gateway for central nervous system processing of auditory information in mammals. It has been proposed that parallel processing channels are set up in the CN, and these form the basis for further computation at higher stations of the auditory system. Despite decades of study, enumeration of CN cell types is incomplete and CN circuitry is described only superficially. In neuroscience generally, classification and naming of neurons has relied primarily upon qualitative approaches based upon human observational capabilities. We have implemented and in some cases developed novel high-throughput and unbiased techniques for labeling, segmenting and classifying neurons in 3D, generated from large-scale electron microscopy image volumes. We propose to deliver a nanoscale map, or connectome, of the mouse CN with enumerated and localized cell types and their synaptic connections. This effort is unbiased because all neurons will be sampled. To achieve this goal, we bring together four parallel modes of tissue analysis for neuron classification: morphology, connectivity, molecular identity and function. We propose that connectivity analysis will define long-proposed parallel processing circuits that will be tested functionally using realistic biophysical models of identified cell types. Notably, the cochlear nucleus contains both amorphous and layered organizations of cells, which serve as templates for all other brain regions. By investigating the fundamental structure of this sensory center, we will establish principles of neural computation and methods for structural and functional phenotyping that will apply to other brain regions regardless of their particular neural architecture. Relevance to Public Health The goal of this project is to deliver to the auditory research community the connectome of the mouse cochlear nucleus. In the process we will refine and develop comprehensive and high throughput methods to catalogue cell types and their connections in any brain region, and will provide molecular phenotypes for cochlear nucleus cell types that may be useful in their targeted manipulation for research and therapeutic purposes.

"Redefining mesenchymal stem cells: using their cellular and molecular phenotypes to determine their regenerative and therapeutic properties ABSTRACT Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have broad-based potential in regenerative medicine cell therapies and can be isolated from a variety of different tissues. Though MSCs from different tissues are phenotypically similar, a barrier to their clinical use is the high variability of their trophic and regenerative properties. This variability suggests that inherent differences exist in the molecular machinery guiding MSC properties between different MSC populations, yet, to date, these differences are ill-defined. To this end, we have preliminary evidence that MSC phenotypes correlate to their regenerative outcomes. In this study, we aim to elucidate how the molecular and cellular properties of distinct MSC populations determine their regenerative properties. Our hypothesis is that MSCs from different tissues have different regenerative properties which correlate to specific molecular profiles defined by gene expression and transcriptional activity. To test this hypothesis, the project proposed has three Specific Aims (SAs). In SA1, we will determine how tissue-specificity dictates gene expression and dynamic transcription factor activity of distinct MSCs. SA2 will determine how differences in the cellular and molecular properties of MSCs correlate to MSC phenotype. Finally, in SA3, we will determine how the molecular profiles and cellular activities of MSCs dictate their regenerative properties. Findings of the proposed study will provide novel insights about how the distinct molecular profiles of MSCs dictate their biological and physiological properties. In a therapeutic context, this would enable the development of innovative screening technologies for MSC therapies to identify and enrich for the most appropriate MSC for the specific therapeutic application. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Stem cell therapies are emerging as a new treatment approach to regenerate lost tissues, treat ischemic disorders, and treat chronic inflammatory conditions. Many of these approaches use stem cells from adults which are present in various regions throughout the body. Our research team is working to better understand how and why these adult stem cells behave the way they do so that we can better determine how to use them in different therapies to treat debilitating health conditions.",Redefining mesenchymal stem cells: using their cellular and molecular phenotypes to determine their regenerative and therapeutic properties,9835275,R01DE028657,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Angiogenic Factor', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Pulp', 'Development', 'Disease', 'ENG gene', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gingiva', 'Health', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Muscle', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Osteogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tooth structure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'alveolar bone', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical translation', 'healthy volunteer', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular phenotype', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oral tissue', 'osteogenic', 'population based', 'regenerative', 'regenerative therapy', 'screening', 'self-renewal', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell population', 'stem cell therapy', 'stemness', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,398630,0.011181571382958142
"COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability of our immune system to respond effectively to pathogenic challenge or vaccination depends on a diverse repertoire of Immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors expressed by B lymphocytes. Each B cell receptor (BCR) is unique, having been assembled during lymphocyte development by recombination of germline encoded V(D)J genes. During the course of an immune response, B cells that initially bind antigen with low affinity through their BCR are modified through cycles of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity-dependent selection to produce high-affinity memory and plasma cells. This affinity maturation is a critical component of T cell dependent adaptive immune responses. It helps guard against rapidly mutating pathogens and underlies the basis for many vaccines, but dysregulation can result in autoimmunity and other diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized our ability to carry out large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) experiments. AIRR-Seq is increasingly being applied to profile BCR repertoires and gain insights into immune responses in healthy individuals and those with a range of diseases, including autoimmunity, infection, allergy, cancer and aging. As NGS technologies improve, these experiments are producing ever larger datasets, with tens- to hundreds-of-millions of BCR sequences. Although promising, repertoire-scale data present fundamental challenges for analysis requiring the development of new techniques and the rethinking of existing methods that are not scalable to the large number of sequences being generated. This proposal describes the development of a series of novel computational methods to explore the central hypothesis that: B cell clonal relationships and lineage structures can be computationally derived from repertoire sequencing data and used to define B cell migration and differentiation networks in health and disease. Specifically, computational methods will be developed to: (Aim 1) identify clonally-related sequences and improve V(D)J gene assignment through determining the Ig locus haplotype, (Aim 2) reconstruct clonal lineages, and use these to learn B cell migration and differentiation networks, and (Aim 3) analyze sequences to predict repertoire properties and sequence motifs that are associated with antigen binding or clinically-relevant outcomes. These through human a combination of simulation-based studies, as (myasthenia gravis) and murine (endogenous methods will be validated well as testing on new experimental data from both retrovirus emergence) systems. Allmethods will be integrated and made available through our widely-used, open-source Immcantation framework, which provides a start-to-finish analytical ecosystem for AIRR-Seq analysis. Together, these methods provide a window into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immunity and the dysregulation that occurs in disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop and validate computational methods to analyze large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) data sets that have become possible with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. The methods development will enable the extraction of new types of information, including immunoglobulin locus haplotypes, as well as B cell migration and differentiation networks. Through quantitative characterization of B cell immunoglobulin repertoires, these methods will provide insights into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immune responses to infection and vaccination, and the dysregulation that occurs in diseases like autoimmunity.",COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS,9670445,R01AI104739,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Cell Receptor Binding', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Clone Cells', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA receptor', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dengue', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Ecosystem', 'Endogenous Retroviruses', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Invaded', 'Laplacian', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Myasthenia Gravis', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Plasma Cells', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retroviridae', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thymectomy', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Virus', 'adaptive immune response', 'adaptive immunity', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'high throughput analysis', 'immunoglobulin receptor', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'method development', 'migration', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'relapse prediction', 'response', 'simulation']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,425122,0.040859641731166685
"Functional and transcriptional analysis of embryonic hematopoietic stem cell development at the single cell level PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The therapeutic potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) could be significantly enhanced by methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells (PSC) or reprogrammed adult cells. Thus, there has been great interest in understanding the embryologic origin of HSC and the signal pathways that guide HSC development and self-renewal, such that the process of HSC genesis can be recapitulated in vitro, a goal which has yet to be realized. Given the heterogeneity and developmental asynchrony in hemogenic precursors during their emergence in the embryo, to achieve this it will be necessary to develop better strategies to isolate and characterize the rare precursors capable of giving rise to HSC and to understand the signals that drive their development to functional, engrafting HSC. To this end, I have established that endothelial cells (EC) derived from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region (AGM), the niche in which the first HSC emerge, can promote the in vitro specification and self-renewal of engrafting HSC from hemogenic precursors, including recent studies at the single cell level. Furthermore, I have shown that the Notch pathway functions in both specification and self-renewal of HSC in the EC niche, and that use of immobilized Notch ligands to activate the Notch pathway, along with hematopoietic cytokines, is sufficient to induce expansion of embryonic HSC. Building upon this work, the goals of this proposal are to utilize this novel in vitro AGM-EC system to elucidate the phenotypic, molecular, and functional properties of HSC precursors as they transition to functional HSC capable of long-term, multilineage engraftment. This will require isolation and functional characterization of HSC precursors across different stages of their development at the single cell level (Aim 1), followed by single cell transcriptional analysis to determine the gene regulatory networks and molecular signals promoting their development to functional HSC (Aim 2A). In studies working toward the engineering of stromal cell-free systems for HSC generation, agonists of identified signaling pathways will be functionally tested for their capacity to support HSC development in conjunction with the known requirement for Notch signaling activation (Aim 2B). Altogether, these studies will provide novel insight into the unique properties of HSC precursors, as well at the signaling mechanisms governing their maturation to functional HSC, which will have important implications in advancing our ability to generate HSC from PSC. To accomplish these aims, I will leverage the wealth of resources available in the mentoring laboratory of Dr. Bernstein, as well as key resources available at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the University of Washington, and Seattle Children’s Hospital, and opportunities for co-mentorship from Dr. Shahin Rafii at the Ansary Stem Cell Institute at Weill Cornell Medical College. A key aspect of my career development plan is to also acquire new skills that will facilitate my research objectives, including techniques in single cell RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis which will be performed in collaboration with and under the co-mentorship of Dr. Cole Trapnell in Genome Sciences at the University of Washington. This type of interdisciplinary training will provide me with the tools necessary to apply innovative technologies in unravelling the complexity of niche- stem cell interactions that instruct HSC fates. My research experience studying hematopoietic stem cell development has provided me with a strong background to facilitate success in the proposed research goals. My clinical experience in caring for children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has cemented a strong passion to expand scientific knowledge of HSC and translate this knowledge to improve therapies for children with hematologic, immunologic, and oncologic diseases. Success in my research and career development goals outlined in this proposal will enable me to establish an independent academic career as a physician-scientist with the skills to lead a diverse research team and collaborate broadly to address essential questions in stem cell biology. Ultimately, my long-term goal is to develop a laboratory-based career with focus on taking fundamental principles discovered through basic research in developmental HSC biology toward clinical applications in hematopoietic stem cell therapeutics.

"Genetic Dissection of Cortical Parvalbumin Interneuron Subtypes Abstract The inhibitory control and dynamic tuning of cortical circuits is mediated by a diversity of GABAergic cell types, but the biological basis of interneuron identity and diversity is not well understood. Here, we combine developmental genetic, anatomic and transcriptomic approaches to define and discover bona fide cell types within a broad class of cortical interneurons. Parvalbumin containing, fast-spiking basket cells (PVCs) are the largest population of interneurons in the neocortex and integrate in infragranular, granular (layer IV), and supragranular circuits, each with unique input/output connectivity. Recent findings from our laboratory and others suggest heterogeneity in PVC morphology, synaptic properties, and connectivity, but it is uncertain how many of these represent distinct subtypes. Using a developmental genetic strategy, we take advantage of the inside-out laminar specification of PVCs to identify and characterize subtypes based on lineage and birth time restricted cohorts. PVCs are derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), and the transition from progenitor to differentiated neuron is marked by the upregulation of proneural transcription factors. By intersecting inducible Ascl1-CreER and Dlx1-CreER mice with PV-Flp mice and an intersectional reporter and inducing in mid-to-late embryogenesis, we have begun parsing adult laminar PVC subtypes for multifactorial single-cell analysis. We quantify the laminar position and morphology of lineage restricted and birth-dated PVC cohorts. We will also carry out single cell RNAseq to analyze their transcription profiles. The integration of morphological and anatomical characterization with single cell RNAseq will increase our understanding of cell identity in PVCs and can potentially uncover new underlying cellular properties. Because PVCs are implicated in schizophrenia, autism, and other mental disorders, their complete profiling at the single cell level could aid in understanding pathophysiology and suggest better treatment strategies. Project Narrative Public Health Relevance: About 1 in 5 Americans are afflicted with mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and autism, placing a considerable burden on individuals and health care institutions across the country. Parvalbumin interneurons are the most prevalent inhibitory cells in the neocortex and their dysfunction implicated across many disorders, though their precise circuit integration is not well understood. This research proposal will lay the foundation for a single-cell understanding of the individual cell types that underlie this powerful “brake” mechanism and identify specific molecular targets that can hopefully lead to better therapeutic strategies.",Genetic Dissection of Cortical Parvalbumin Interneuron Subtypes,9648030,F31MH114529,"['Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Date of birth', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Ganglia', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Myoepithelial cell', 'Neocortex', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Radial', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratum Granulosum', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Up-Regulation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'design', 'developmental genetics', 'differential expression', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genetic approach', 'intersectionality', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'single cell analysis', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,F31,2019,34926,0.07699650567904417
"Mechanobiology of aortic smooth muscle cells in human iPSC-based models of Marfan Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY Marfan Syndrome (MFS), one of the most common heritable connective tissue disorders, affects 1 in 5,000 individuals and has destructive manifestations in multiple organ systems; notably the cardiovascular system. MFS is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a genetic mutation in the Fibrillin-1 gene leading to aberrant TGFβ signaling, and frequently results in aortic aneurysm, dissection, and death. Interestingly, the associated degeneration within the aortic vessel wall almost always occurs in the aortic root or ascending aorta and not in the descending or abdominal aorta; while this putatively reflects regional differences in hemodynamic stress, antihypertensive treatment alone is not effective in managing aortic aneurysm in MFS. Alternatively, it is also the case that aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), which predominate the vasoactive medial layer of the vessel wall, have heterogeneous subtypes stemming from distinct developmental germ-layers based on their anatomical location; Neuroectoderm (NE) origin gives rise to ascending ASMCs and Paraxial mesoderm (PM) origin gives rise to descending ASMCs. This project will use origin-specific ASMCs differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MFS and healthy controls to test a novel hypothesis that developmental origin causes location-specific abnormalities in ASMCs associated with medial degeneration in MFS. Additionally, it will explore for biomarkers of presymptomatic congenital defects in Marfan Syndrome to identify novel targets for prophylactic therapeutic intervention. These studies will characterize phenotypic differences in human ASMC subtypes at the cellular and tissue level with stem-cell culturing and vascular tissue engineering techniques. Using state-of-the-art core facilities we will also conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analysis on these cellular and tissue models to cultivate a rich biological profile for bioinformatic analysis. Furthermore, we will develop a bioinformatics pipeline to elucidate novel prophylactic targets inherently responsible for ascending aortic MFS-induced medial degeneration, using our uniquely combined phenotypic, transcriptomic, and proteomic results as input. Lastly, based on our bioinformatic outputs we will test our intervention on our human iPSC-based in vitro models and compare to treatment with Losartan, a commonly used anti-hypertensive drug that also exhibits unique anti-remodeling properties and has shown promise for managing the symptoms of MFS in animals and in patients. The training plan for this fellowship will focus on technical skills, experimental design and critical analysis, critique of published scientific data, and presentation skills. It will be achieved by regular mentor meetings, journal clubs, conference presentations, bi- annual committee meetings, and advanced coursework. The majority of training will occur in the Costa Lab at the Cardiovascular Research Center at ISMMS, a highly active and collaborative environment with available mentors and students aligned with my research topics and career goals. Additional training will occur in the Ramirez Lab with senior researchers in Marfan Syndrome and biochemical investigation techniques. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposes a bioengineering approach for investigating new human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based cellular and 3D tissue models of Marfan Syndrome (MFS), a rare connective tissue disorder that frequently causes aortic aneurysm and dissection specifically in the ascending aorta. Our findings will elucidate mechanobiological differences in aortic smooth muscle cells of distinct embryologic origin, and their underlying mechanisms of response to mechanical stimuli. This will help improve our understanding of aneurysm localization in MFS, and guide more effective therapies for MFS patients in the future.",Mechanobiology of aortic smooth muscle cells in human iPSC-based models of Marfan Syndrome,9836422,F31HL149271,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Actins', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Aneurysm', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Core Facility', 'Critiques', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descending aorta', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FBN1', 'Fellowship', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Germ', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Losartan', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Neural Crest', 'Neuroectoderm', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paraxial Mesoderm', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scanning Probe Microscopes', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Stem cells', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Students', 'Sudden Death', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Vascular remodeling', 'abdominal aorta', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'body system', 'career', 'cell dimension', 'collaborative environment', 'confocal imaging', 'drug candidate', 'effective therapy', 'healthy volunteer', 'hemodynamics', 'heritable connective tissue disorder', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'lead candidate', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanotransduction', 'meetings', 'multidimensional data', 'nanoindentation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prophylactic', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'regional difference', 'response', 'scaffold', 'skills', 'stem', 'symposium', 'symptom management', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'two-dimensional', 'vascular tissue engineering']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,F31,2019,44856,0.03913497384874691
"Quantitative molecular and cellular MRI of hepatocyte transplantation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  For many severe liver diseases, the only effective treatment is liver transplantation. Unfortunately, due to the shortage of available donor organs, or the patient's age, liver transplantation is not available to all patients. Hepatocyte transplantation (HTx) is an alternative, experimental treatment, with limited long term success in humans. A major unsolved question is how can we dynamically monitor and quantify cell transplantation in HTx to help improve HTx and to closely monitor clinical implementation?  To answer this question, we combine an innovative molecular and cellular MRI approach, with machine learning and computer vision, to non-invasively quantify cell engraftment and long term engraftment and repopulation (LTER) in the liver following HTx. Using a mouse model that facilitates LTER following HTx, we will use this combined approach to quantify transplanted cells in the liver at Days 1 and 7 after HTx, reflecting the timings of initial cell delivery (Day 1) and actual cellular engraftment in the tissue (Day 7). Then, we will measure LTER of these cells in the liver 30 - 90 days post-transplant, making innovative use of Eovist, an FDA approved MRI contrast agent specific for healthy hepatocytes. These experiments will evaluate mouse donor cells, as well as pig primary hepatocytes and pig embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocyte cell line.  This transformative work will be the first study to achieve this level of quantification wit molecular and cellular MRI of regenerative medicine, in any animal model. Additionally, we will test pattern recognition algorithms aimed at predicting the outcome of LTER, at an early stage. The capability to predict LTER outcome would be paradigm shifting as it would enable physicians to consider additional HTx regimens or second line treatments if HTx fails. This is seldom possible.  Though this project will be developed on mice, clinical translation of the imaging protocol would be straightforward because the exact imaging and data analysis scheme that we use to measure HTx in mouse, can be used to measure HTx in humans. Eovist is FDA approved for use in humans with liver disease, and MRI-based cell tracking of iron labeled cells is in clinical trials. Our preliminary data strongly suggests that MRI and data analysis can discriminate single cells at 200 µm resolution, meaning the MRI could likely be performed on any high field human MRI system. Additionally, the discovery that a stem cell-derived hepatocyte achieved even partial LTER would be extremely encouraging for exploring human and/or pig stem cell-derived hepatocytes for human use, because these cells can potentially alleviate the crucial issue of poor cell supply, similar to progress seen in pig islet transplant.  The proposed research takes a multidisciplinary approach with expertise in hepatocyte transplant and biology, molecular imaging, machine learning/computer vision, and mouse liver disease models. Collaboration among the researchers is ongoing with extensive preliminary data across all aspects of the proposed work. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of hepatocyte transplantation as an alternative to whole liver transplant requires non-invasive methodologies for monitoring the fate of transplanted cells.

"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis. In addition to developing physics-based models for diverse biological phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical important tools and algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) a new linear-algebra based algorithm for assessing the fidelity of directed differentiation and cellular reprogramming protocols and visualizing reprogramming/differentiation dynamics and (2) improved algorithms for inferring microbial interactions in the human microbiome from high-throughput sequence data. These computational tools will allow scientists to realize the immense therapeutic potential of cellular reprogramming and microbial ecology-based techniques for studying and treating human disease.

"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE Mapping effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing of different types of individual cells, understanding the func- tion and relationships between those cell types, and modeling their individual and collective function. In order to exploit human and machine intelligence, different visual interfaces will be implemented that use the CCF in support of data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, mathematical biology, and biomedical data standards to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimen- sional spatial basemap of the human body and associated data overlays that can be interactively explored online as an atlas of tissue maps. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across the human body along multiple functional contexts (e.g., systems physiology, vascular, or endocrine systems), and connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources as driven by the context or “position” on the map. The CCF and the interactive data visualizations will be multi-level and multi-scale sup- porting the exploration and communication of tissue and publication data--from single cell to whole body. In the first year, the proposed Mapping Component will run user needs analyses, compile an initial CCF using pre-existing classifications and ontologies; implement two interactive data visualizations; and evaluate the usa- bility and effectiveness of the CCF and associated visualizations in formal user studies. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an ex- tensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spa- tial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical. This project will work in close coordination with the HuBMAP consortium to help drive an ecosystem of useful resources for understanding and leveraging high- resolution human image data and to compile a human body atlas.","The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets",9687220,OT2OD026671,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biometry', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Endocrine system', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Vascular System', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'hackathon', 'human imaging', 'interoperability', 'member', 'systematic review', 'usability', 'vector']",OD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,OT2,2018,330000,0.01604107072624738
"High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is one of the most important tools for high-throughput single cell analysis. Fluorescent labeling acts as the primary approach for cellular analysis in flow cytometry. Nevertheless, fluorescent tags are not applicable to all cases especially small molecules (e.g. metabolites) for which labeling may significantly perturb their properties. Raman spectroscopic signals arising from inherent molecular vibrations provide a key approach to detect specific molecules inside cells and to differentiate cellular state. Raman-based microfluidic devices have been reported. However, the very small cross section of spontaneous Raman scattering results in low Raman signal level and consequently long data acquisition time, which is not compatible with the high- speed flow condition. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to establish a high-throughput high-content single cell analysis platform using molecular fingerprint vibrations as contrast. The specific objective of current application is to develop a vibrational spectroscopic cytometer based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process. Several recent advances in the Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) lab, including the highly sensitive femtosecond SRS imaging, lock-in free SRS signal detection and a tuned amplifier array for multiplex SRS imaging, pave the foundation for the planned instrumentation. The PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team for the proposed study. Dr. J. Paul Robinson (co-PI) is a leader in development and applications of fluorescence-based flow cytometer and he will bring expertise to the design of fluidics and multichannel detection systems. Dr. Bartek Rajwa (co-PI) will provide expertise for spectroscopic cytometry data analysis and machine learning. The team will design and construct a SRS flow cytometer by multichannel detection of dispersed SRS signal (Aim 1), construct a tandem system able to collect SRS and fluorescence data (Aim 2), develop spectral un-mixing and machine-learning analysis tools able to combine the information obtained from SRS spectra and labeled biomarkers for functional classification of cells (Aim 3), and validate the capability of SRS flow cytometer for label-free detection of single-cell metabolism (Aim 4). With a speed of analyzing thousands of cells per second, SRS flow cytometer will enable high-throughput analysis of single-cell chemical content which is beyond the reach by fluorescence-based flow cytometer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build a high-throughput single cell analysis platform through multiplex stimulated Raman scattering detection of single flowing cells at microsecond time scale. Having fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering detection in tandem, our platform is capable of discovering new metabolic signatures of cell subpopulations (e.g. cancer stem cells sorted through fluorescent markers). Such discovery could potentially lead to new development of disease-specific treatment strategies.",High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry,9525343,R01GM118471,"['Amplifiers', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Energy Transfer', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nanostructures', 'Optics', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quartz', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tube', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'cancer stem cell', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'design and construction', 'detector', 'electric impedance', 'high throughput analysis', 'instrumentation', 'light scattering', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'photomultiplier', 'public health relevance', 'single cell analysis', 'small molecule', 'spectroscopic data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'vibration']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2018,388379,0.06763618688140195
"Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases of aging account for a significant proportion of healthcare spending and result in a painful and limiting existence for many tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of people around the world. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that re-purposes known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content fluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced in human cells in which diseases and treatments have been modeled. This system has been adapted to screen for drugs which may preferentially destroy senescent cells, as this may result in improved tissue function and decreases in pathology and mortality related to aging. In this SBIR fast-track proposal we will:  PHASE I Identify a morphological profile of senescence in a variety of human cell types. Progression to Phase II will depend on our ability to demonstrate the power of our morphological approach to identify senescent cells independent of any known senescent markers.  PHASE II Identify known drugs which preferentially destroy senescent cells, without affecting healthy cells, as identified by morphometric means.  Evaluate the efficacy of identified senolytic agents in a variety of tissue function and health-span models in mice. *Evaluate the effect of identified senolytic agents in a murine model of age-associated cardiovascular disease. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I/Phase II Fast-track SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds we identify as a result. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic diseases of aging affect a significant proportion of Americans. Cellular senescence, a useful biological program which prevents replication of cells exposed to various stresses that may be at risk of initiating tumors, has long-term deleterious inflammatory effects. We will combine biological, imaging, and computational approaches to identify complex morphological profiles associated with senescence, to identify senescence- killing effects of known drugs, and to evaluate any hits in relevant models of aging.",Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction,9789427,R44AG053131,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'CDKN2A gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Aging', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Stress', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Length', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organ', 'Oxidants', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Telomere Shortening', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppression', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'beta-Galactosidase', 'cell type', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'functional disability', 'healthspan', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'senescence', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NIA,"RECURSION PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC",R44,2018,509173,0.02238304874253472
"Mechanisms of mechanosensing through integrins Project Summary  Cells sense extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and physical forces applied through the ECM through integrin-mediated adhesions. These mechanotransduction processes play critical roles in embryonic development, normal physiology and multiple diseases, including cancer, hypertension, atherosclerosis and fibrosis among others. However, mechanical responses differ between cell types, between the same cell type in different states, and even in different regions of single cells. While much has been learned about mechanotransduction through integrins, a major area of ignorance is how different types and components of matrix adhesions modulate cell responses to force. The aim of this project is therefore to characterize the mechanosensing properties of distinct types and compositions of integrin mediated adhesions and elucidate the molecular basis for these differences.  A major limitation in our current understanding of mechanosensing by different types of adhesions is that current, morphology-based classifications into nascent, focal or fibrillary adhesions or focal complexes are imprecise, with little information about composition or structure. Additionally, adhesions in cells continuously evolve, so that actual adhesions are often mixtures of different types. Recent work has now defined specific molecular complexes that serve as modules for construction of different adhesion classes. Indeed, the data argue that adhesions have a modular structure with these protein complexes serving as the core modules that are combined and modified to generate diversity. Based on this hypothesis, we will: 1.Combine biochemical approaches with novel imaging and machine learning methods to elucidate the composition and behaviors of the distinct adhesion modules. 2.Utilize these biochemical and imaging methods in conjunction with assays of cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics and tension to characterize the cytoskeletal organization and dynamics for the distinct adhesion complexes. 3.Combine novel imaging and engineering approaches to characterize the distinct signaling properties of the different adhesion states and their responses to substrate stiffness and applied strain. Project Narrative Integrin mediated adhesions sense the mechanical properties of and forces applied through the extracellular matrix. A major area of ignorance in this field is how different types of adhesions differentially respond to mechanical information. One reason for this problem is our limited current understanding of the composition and structure of different types of adhesions. This multi-PO project will combine highly novel biochemical, imaging and image analysis, force measurement, mechanotransduction and signaling methods to develop a deeper understanding of the composition and structure of different adhesion types, and apply this information to understanding their cytoskeletal dynamics and mechanotransduction properties.",Mechanisms of mechanosensing through integrins,9554952,R01GM047214,"['Actomyosin', 'Adhesions', 'Admixture', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibrosis', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Integrins', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Talin', 'Vinculin', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mechanical properties', 'mechanotransduction', 'molecular imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'protein complex', 'response', 'sensor', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,412050,0.043383139925514715
"Deciphering the building blocks of hippocampal circuits   Abstract   Since  Ramon  y  Cajal,  neuroscientists  have  speculated  that  even  the  most  complex  brain  functions  might  eventually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. Unfortunately, our under‐ standing of the brain's extensive diversity of cell types and elaborate circuitry remains far from complete. For  example, despite the hippocampus being essential for learning and memory and its dysfunction underlying a  wide variety of devastating neuropsychiatric disorders, we still lack fundamental knowledge about its constit‐ uent cell types and their molecular profiles and connectivity, slowing progress towards a mechanistic circuit‐ level understanding of memory formation. We propose to identify all of the interneuron cell types in area CA1  of the hippocampus and decipher their canonical connectivity. We have assembled a strong interdisciplinary  team  capable  of  combining  cutting‐edge  technologies  including  high‐throughput  multi‐cell  patch  recordings,  morphological reconstructions, single‐cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to achieve two main goals:  1) dissect CA1 microcircuit organization by generating a morphological and electrophysiological taxonomy of  all interneuron cell types in mouse CA1 and map their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of  morphologically defined CA1 interneurons using our newly developed Patch‐seq method. Our team recently  implemented  this  interdisciplinary  experimental  strategy  to  successfully  identify  cell  types  in  the  neocortex  and dissect their microcircuitry. Using multi‐cell patch clamp recording, we will characterize the electrophysi‐ ological properties, morphology, laminar location and connectivity of thousands of neurons from mouse CA1  hippocampus. We will also utilize a new, highly sensitive, cost effective technique for single‐cell RNA sequenc‐ ing (Smart‐seq2) to map their transcriptomes and machine learning techniques to classify cells into molecular  types.  Importantly,  our  high‐throughput  method  will  allow  us  to  obtain  morphological,  electrophysiological  and  complete  transcriptome  information  for  single  neurons,  which  cannot  be  achieved  using  other  methods  such as dissociating tissue for single‐cell sequencing. In‐house customization and automation has reduced our  sequencing costs, enabling us to sequence thousands of cells within a reasonable budget. Cell type identifica‐ tion will be validated using morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular tests. Identifying all of the in‐ terneuron  cell  types  that  comprise  CA1  and  determining  how  they  connect  to  each  other  will  have  a  broad,  paradigm‐shifting impact. For instance, it will contribute to a circuit‐level understanding of the computations  that take place in CA1, such as memory formation. From a clinical perspective, single‐cell transcriptome data  will yield a powerful atlas to investigate relationships between cell types and genes related to neuropsychiatric  diseases and facilitate cell‐type engineering.       Narrative  The  hippocampus  is  a  complex  brain  structure  that  mediates  remarkable  mental  functions  like  learning  and  memory, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's

"High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure Project Summary The overall objective of this research project is to develop a novel approach for high throughput screening of individual cells based on holographic imaging. To achieve this goal, we propose to implement a new quantitative phase imaging modality, holographic cytomtery, which incorporates several novel technical advances to enable high throughput imaging. Holographic cytometry (HC) will bring the high sensitivity of quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) to imaging of cells flowing through microfluidic devices. While QPM has been used for cell analysis previously, typically only a handful of cells have been imaged. To enable significant application of QPM for fundamental cell biology and clinical studies, it is necessary to move to a high throughput implementation. Technical advances needed to realize the high resolution HC system include use of high speed line scan cameras, microfluidic chips with multiple parallel channels, and light from a pulsed laser source to enable stroboscopic illumination. In order to efficiently analyze and process this data set, rapid analysis software will be developed that leverages the highly parallel processing capabilities of graphics processing units and machine learning algorithms to enable automated classification. The proposed HC method can be applied to imaging a wide range of flowing cells. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we will initially target the measurement of cancerous progression due to environmental toxicant exposure. We have conducted a preliminary study that shows QPM can detect early changes in the biomechanical properties of cells due to arsenic exposure. In the proposed project, we seek to develop QPM based biomarkers of pre-cancerous change that will enable rapid assessesment. QPM has not been implemented in such a format to date and thus is not yet a feasible approach for clinical or research studies. To meet the goal of high throughput imaging with QPM, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1. Develop new instrumentation for high speed imaging using off axis digital holography. 2. Implement high throughput analysis methods based on machine learning 3. Test and validate high throughput system with pilot studies of heavy metal exposed epithelial cells to show the approach can detect early pre-cancerous changes due to environmental toxicant exposure. Upon completion of this project, we will have realized a high throughput imaging cytometry system for research and clinical applications. Project Narrative  The proposed research will develop a new high throughput cellular screening technology based on quantitative phase image of cells flowing in a microfluidic chip. This technology will allow researchers and doctors to obtain holographic images of every single cell in a sample in a short amount of time which can then be analyzed by a computer. This would offer the opportunity to evaluate the characteristics of populations of cells for understanding changes in public health due to environmental factors.",High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure,9610235,R21ES029791,"['Algorithms', 'Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cytology', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Image Cytometry', 'Individual', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Metal exposure', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population Characteristics', 'Premalignant', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Vision', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'carcinogenesis', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'detector', 'digital', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mechanical properties', 'microscopic imaging', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'parallel processing', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'screening', 'shear stress', 'systems research', 'tool', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,209312,0.03453924192697017
"iFACS: Imaging Florescence Activated Cell Sorter to sort cells based on images iFACS: Imaging Florescence Activated Cell Sorter to sort cells based on images NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Advances in reagents (e.g. CRiSPR) and analytical tools (e.g. flow cytometers) have improved the ability to alter and characterize cellular phenotypes. Ultimately, many key applications in biomedicine require efficient and accurate isolation of cell populations according to features contained in high content images. Unfortunately, microscopic laser microdissection systems have a throughput that is too slow to be practical in many applications; while the existing flow cytometers that can sort cells (fluorescence-activated cell sorters or FACS) provide only size, internal complexity, and fluorescence intensity information and lack the rich data of imaging. Another critical limitation is that the existing flow cytometers that can image, cannot sort cells. NanoCellect has made a highly affordable FACS to increase access to this important high-throughput tool for cell analysis. Here we propose to enhance our existing low-cost FACS with the ability to image cells and sort them based on image features. This will allow users to pursue new strategies in drug screening and mechanism of action research; as well as work with suspension cell lines, such as those that dominate the recent advances in immuno-oncology. In Phase I research, we have demonstrated the world's first imaging flow cytometer with cell sorting capabilities (iFACS) in a unique design of space-time coding with an optical spatial filter. The approach adds negligible cost to the system for the desirable features of cell imaging and sorting. To fully realize the enormous potential of the design and to meet the demands for most applications, in Phase II we will develop high-throughput image-based cell sorting with innovative image-guided gating schemes supported by machine learning and interactive user/machine interface. Essentially, image-based flow cytometry gating uses similar cell isolation criteria as the techniques of laser capture microdissection or cell aspiration to isolate cells of interest, with 10,000X throughput improvements to 1000+ cells per second. We envision such unique capabilities will become common, default features for tomorrow's users as the tool becomes as intuitive and ubiquitous as fluorescent microscopy. The proposed iFACS will be transformative and benefit numerous biomedical applications, such as isolation of cells based on organelle translocation, cell cycle analyses, detection and counting of phagocytosed particles, and protein co-localization, to name just a few. iFACS: Imaging Florescence Activated Cell Sorter to sort cells based on images NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc.

"Alicanto:  Proteogenomic discovery of single chain antibodies in llama Antibodies are a key component of the adaptive immune system, released in response to disease in order to target foreign molecular surfaces. Due to their capacity for high target affinity and specificity, they’ve become one of the fastest growing classes of therapeutic molecules addressing a range of disease including infectious diseases, auto-immune diseases, and cancer. Camelids, including llamas, camels, and alpacas, produce a unique repertoire of antibodies that includes both dual chain antibodies and single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies, due to their comparative structural simplicity, are simpler to express and develop at the scale required for therapeutics. In addition, single chain antibodies are able to bind to small epitopes, such as enzyme active sites, that would be hidden to larger, dual chain antibodies. The binding domain of the single chain antibody may be small enough to infiltrate traditionally difficult to access tissues, including crossing the blood-brain barrier.  Current approaches to single chain antibody discovery require the collection of cells that encode the antibody genes, including memory B cells and plasma cells. Target-specific antibodies are selected after the antibody transcripts are cloned into a display system, such as phage or yeast. While memory B cells and plasma cells represent only a minute fraction of the cells located in peripheral blood, target- specific antibodies are present in high concentration in blood after an infection. Each plasma cell can secrete thousands of antibodies per minute. Digital Proteomics is developing Alicanto, a technology that utilizes the antibodies circulating in blood to identify target-specific antibodies.  Alicanto integrates two sources of information about the antibody repertoire. First, Alicanto constructs a database of potential antigen-specific antibodies by performing next-generation sequencing of antibody transcripts. Next, Alicanto enriches for target-specific antibodies from the blood using affinity chromatography and subjects the antibodies to tandem mass spectrometry. Finally, Alicanto uses machine learning models to integrate the sequencing and mass spectrometry data to derive a collection of target-specific antibody candidates. For single chain antibody discovery, Alicanto will use specialized primers and enrichment techniques to isolate only the subset of the antibody repertoire that contains the single chain antibodies. Alicanto will be used to discover high affinity, single chain antibodies for development as therapeutic molecules. Antibodies are produced natively in humans to fight disease and the molecules have garnered significant attention due to their therapeutic potential. Single-chain antibodies, which are smaller than conventional antibodies, represent a new frontier for antibody-based therapeutics due to their ability to target molecular surfaces that would be hidden to larger antibodies, as well as the relative simplicity of their development.

"Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on “manual gating” of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 – Implement a novel computational infrastructure – FlowGate – for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 – Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 – Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 – Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community. Project Narrative Flow cytometry analysis is widely used for single cell phenotyping in the translational research lab to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes and in the clinical diagnostic lab for the identification and classification of blood-borne malignancies. However, the current practice for cytometry data analysis using “manual gating” based on two-dimensional data plots is subjective, labor-intensive and unreliable, especially when using more complex high content staining panels. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly computational infrastructure for cytometry data analysis for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective, accurate, and reproducible analysis of cytometry data.",Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics,9533373,U01TR001801,"['Abnormal Cell', 'Acute leukemia', 'Adoption', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antiviral Therapy', 'Apoptosis', 'Asthma', 'Autoimmunity', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Leukocyte Chemotaxis', 'Lymphocyte Immunophenotypings', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translational Research', 'Visual', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computer infrastructure', 'cyber infrastructure', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'human disease', 'improved', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'monocyte', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outreach', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'research study', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational study', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCATS,"J.

"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells-Supplement     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists.

"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers. Our goal is to show that the proposed multi-tissue platform can replicate the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients, and be used to develop better therapeutic regimens.",Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies,9549091,UG3EB025765,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Blood Substitutes', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Myopathy', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Protective Agents', 'Proteins', 'Regimen', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Source', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'bone', 'circulating microRNA', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug testing', 'imaging modality', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic target']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,UG3,2018,1000,0.018077887928762224
"Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker Discovery in Translational Research with Cloud Data Integration Project Summary/Abstract Cytobank is the leading cloud-based platform for analysis and storage of single cell flow and mass cytometry data, technologies that are essential for investigating the interplay between the immune system and disease conditions including cancer. There are numerous data analysis steps between raw data and insight especially for many single-cell technologies, where the data analysis is complex, highly expert-driven and/or reliant on novel computational methodologies. Cytobank already makes major contributions (1) centralizing single-cell cytometry data, (2) providing data analysis traceability that removes knowledge sharing complexities, and (3) establishing a platform that increases access to cutting edge algorithms and makes complex machine learning methods easy for biologists to use. However, as the amount, complexity, and different types of single cell data and other associated data increases and the number of workflows and single-cell algorithms to analyze the data also increases, the need for open and easy access to existing and new tools and secure, complete storage of the workflows and the resulting data has increased to the point of being critical for supporting basic and translational research collaborations and enabling them to efficiently achieve their objectives including biomarker discovery and development. The proposed project significantly extends the capabilities of the Cytobank platform. This will benefit the community by (1) enabling scalable and secure access to a number of new single-cell data analysis tools that will result in new automated workflows, and (2) enable more efficient cross platform knowledge generation with increased meta-analysis capabilities across experiments and data types. The potential of this project is that thousands of scientists around the world will be able to more easily leverage additional single-cell cytometry, transcript, and other data in their translational research data analysis including automating analysis that has primarily been dominated by expert-driven annotation, thus providing a central repository and knowledge management framework that will accelerate biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Project Narrative Single-cell biology and Immunotherapy are exploding and generating larger and more complex datasets in combination clinical trials. To take full advantage of these revolutions, the iteration and dissemination of advanced single-cell data analysis algorithms (many of whose development was funded by the NIH) needs to scale at the same rate as single-cell data generation technologies are scaling, and multi-omics data analysis and visualization must be integrated and automated. This project will greatly accelerate scientific research, transparency, and reproducibility by significantly lowering the barrier to perform complex data analysis of multiple types of high-dimensional data, providing the biomedical research community with access to powerful tools needed in immuno-oncology, autoimmunity and other high-impact disease areas.",Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker Discovery in Translational Research with Cloud Data Integration,9464486,R44GM117914,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunology', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'clinically actionable', 'cloud based', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'relapse prediction', 'repository', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NIGMS,"CYTOBANK, INC.",R44,2018,613841,0.06496835499776242
"Systems Analysis of cell type differentiation in Xenopus development Summary The pathways involved in embryonic development have been a rich resource for understanding disease in adults, as well as being critically important in tracing the effects of genetic lesions and environmental poisons in the fetus. Frog embryos have been particularly useful due to the large size of the frog egg and embryo. New tools we developed for measuring the expression of RNA at a single-cell level, and advances in protein and phosphopeptide measurement technologies, offer hope for dramatic progress in understanding how signals involved in the maturation of the embryo direct individual cells to adopt specific fates. Our first goal is to define cell types using single-cell transcriptomics, and to define the lineages that result in specific cell types using high resolution temporal mappings. Targeted transcriptomics and proteomics of important molecules involved in specifying cell fate, such as transcription factors, will provide an index of the levels of signaling activity in each individual cell. This will result in an unprecedentedly detailed molecular picture of the factors involved in producing the phenotypes, and their interconversions from the early cleavage stage to the middle of organogenesis. The Xenopus model system allows us to dissect out portions of the early embryo that differentiate to ectoderm if not disturbed, called the animal cap. In the context of the embryo the cells in the animal cap receive a number of developmental signals, including Nodal, BMP, and Wnt. Combinations of these three signals (in different proportions) are capable of generating many of the major tissues. We will expose animal caps to a matrix of these three signals and trace the differentiation pathways that result, using single-cell RNA sequencing. This study of the molecular roots of differentiation decisions will be used to develop a mathematical approach, based on machine learning, to predicting the results of an attempted perturbation of the development of Xenopus. We will ask whether cell types are carefully specified by tightly controlled combinations of ligands or whether there are default states that are hard to escape from (""basins of attraction""), that therefore form the majority of embryonic cell types. The answer to this question is central to our understanding of how the Xenopus embryo reliably develops into a frog, and will accelerate efforts to create computational methods to predict the behavior of other biological pathways such as those involved in cancer. Narrative The complexity of biology makes it hard to predict what effect a mutation or a drug will have. We will use new tools to measure when genes are expressed at the individual cell level throughout the course of development of a vertebrate embryo. This will give us new information on the cell types involved in tissue and organ formation, and will provide an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that we will use to develop a mathematical model of how the decision to become a specific cell type is made.",Systems Analysis of cell type differentiation in Xenopus development,9551005,R01HD073104,"['Activins', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Animal Cap', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm Cell', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Nodal', 'Organ', 'Organogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylated Peptide', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plant Roots', 'Poison', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'RNA library', 'Rana', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrometry', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Xenopus', 'Xenopus laevis', 'base', 'blastomere structure', 'cell type', 'cluster computing', 'course development', 'egg', 'embryo cell', 'experimental study', 'hatching', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'notochord', 'novel', 'phosphoproteomics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'single cell proteins', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'vertebrate embryos', 'xenopus development']",NICHD,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2018,666380,0.12217143957684935
"The Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape- NeuroDevelopment (MIEL-ND) assay: a high throughput platform to screen compounds for neurodevelopmental effects Neurodevelopmental diseases (NDDs – Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Intellectual Disabilities, Bipolar disorders, and Schizophrenia, etc.) are prevalent and due to errors in neurodifferentiation and neurocircuitry. While NDDs, in many cases, are due to inherited mutations, evidence is mounting that prenatal exposure to environmental toxicants also cause NDDs via disruption of epigenetics (e.g., modifications of histones [histone tags] or methylation of DNA). Our project will develop the Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape- NeuroDevelopment (MIEL-ND) assay, which will enable testing of chemicals for epigenetic effects related to NDDs. In preliminary research by Alexey Terskikh (Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute) MIEL methods were developed in which human Neural Precursor Cells (NPCs, from fetal brain) were treated with test compounds and analyzed for changes in the pattern of histone tags within the nuclei (altered “epigenetic signature” – which utilizes multiplexed immunolabeling, automated high throughput imaging, and cell-by-cell analysis using machine learning). A subset of chemicals from the US EPA ToxCast program was analyzed, and “epigenetic hits” were identified. In a separate approach, Vala Sciences Inc, which commercializes cell-based assays relevant to toxicology/drug discovery, tested EPA compounds on synapses/neurite formation in neurons developed from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-neurons), which represent human neurons in early stages of maturation. When results from the assays were compared, several epigenetic hits also altered synapse and neurite formation in the iPSC-neurons consistent with the hypothesis that epigenetic alterations may alter fate decisions of NPCs and neurodevelopment. To further develop the MIEL-ND, we propose to screen additional ToxCast compounds for effects on epigenetic and cell fate NPCs and test the compounds for effects on synapse/neurites in iPSC-neurons to develop a library of epigenetic hits with known effects on the two cell types. We will use these data and emerging data from the ToxCast program, to develop and optimize the MIEL-ND to predict NDD-inducing effects of possible environmental toxicants. The MIEL- ND will identify compounds that affect neurodevelopment that are not cytotoxic (which are missed by current assays) and represents a less expensive, higher throughput, more predictive alternative to current tests which use animals, thus reducing the use of animals in toxicity testing. Phase II goals include developing a version of the MIEL-ND featuring iPSC-NPCs (enabling use of cells derived from patients with NDDs), and adaptation of the assay to identify potential therapeutics for NDDs. Our proposed project will develop an assay to enable us to test environmental pollutants for their potential to cause neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as Autism, Intellectual Disability [retardation], Bipolar Disease [Manic Depression], and Schizophrenia. While many cases of NDDs are due to inherited mutations (the disease “runs in the family”), recent research indicates that exposure of the mother to pollution during pregnancy can cause NDDs in children that would otherwise be healthy. This is because development of the fetal brain is very sensitive to toxins. In our assay, cells representing early stages of brain development will be cultured in the laboratory and treated with compounds from the US EPA that are linked to NDDs. The cells will be photographed with robotic microscopes and the images analyzed with computers to determine which compounds may alter neurodevelopment. Currently, testing for effects on brain development of the fetus is done with animal testing. Our assay will be cheaper, more rapid, and more predictive than animal models (since it will use human cells); our assay will reduce the use of animals in toxicity research, which is a big problem, as hundreds of new compounds are developed, each year, for use in agriculture and manufacturing, and help reduce the number of people afflicted with NDDs.",The Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape- NeuroDevelopment (MIEL-ND) assay: a high throughput platform to screen compounds for neurodevelopmental effects,9623072,R41MH119621,"['Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computers', 'Conceptions', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Viability', 'Fetus', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'National Toxicology Program', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Neurites', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pollution', 'Pregnancy', 'Research', 'Research Contracts', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Toxin', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost', 'cytotoxicity', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'epigenome', 'fetal', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'microscopic imaging', 'nerve stem cell', 'neural precursor cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuron development', 'prediction algorithm', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'screening', 'self-renewal', 'senescence', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIMH,"VALA SCIENCES, INC.",R41,2018,300000,-0.031337405094436874
"New Integrative Pathway Analysis Methods to Predict Biomedical Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to reveal the key regulators that determine the usually ordered development of an animal from undifferentiated pluripotent cells to specialized cells that carry out all of the functions in our body. The coordinated expression of the genome underlies these processes and is orchestrated by networks of interacting genes that we are only beginning to unveil. Cell circuitry is complex but the discovery of the Yamanaka factors demonstrates that even less than a handful of transcription factors can exert profound changes on cell and tissue fates. Thus, the combinations of genes needed to unlock cell determinants seem tantalizingly parsimonious. Large-scale projects are underway to catalog the genomic, epigenomic, and functional genomic landscapes of many different cells in multiple different organisms. As high- throughput techniques such as DNA and RNA sequencing mature, there is an increase in demand for integrative approaches to elucidate the rules underlying intrinsic, adaptive, and programmed phenotypic changes that cells undergo that can be inferred from such data. Our starting point will be to extend the pathway integrative framework developed over the past several years for the interpretation of cancer genomics datasets for the Cancer Genome Atlas project. Extensions to the input pathways used, and advances in the model to enrich the formal representation, will be developed so that a breadth of datasets in human and model organisms can be analyzed. The approach will culminate in the combining of machine-learning classification with probabilistic graphical models. The classifiers will identify predictive pathway features for cell state distinctions in a large database. Genetic manipulations among these features can then be proposed, in any combination, as formal interventions on the graphical model of the resulting classifiers, a major advantage of this work. The pathway models will be applied to the prediction of factors that can confer differentiation and de-differentiation queues to human cortical neurons. Computationally predicted gene perturbations in this system will be tested in living cells. Identifying critical modulators of the cell fate decisions underlying the conversion of stem cells to neural progenitors to mature neural cell types will advance our understanding of neural development. These same regulators may also play an important role in glioma, a disease where the tumor cells appear to be in a neural progenitor-like state. Taken together, the proposed theoretical and applied informatics approaches will contribute powerful tools for interpreting and predicting both routine and aberrant cellular responses. Researchers will be able to query the complex networks with computer algorithms as high fidelity surrogates. In the not so distant future, our hope is to advance our understanding of normal differentiation and shed light on how the regulation of these programs breaks down in disease processes like cancer, shedding light on diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to extend machine-learning and probabilistic graphical modeling approaches developed in the field of cancer genomics to the analysis of a broad range of human and model organism datasets. Novel methods for proposing genetic perturbations using a formal computational analysis will be developed and tested for their ability to suggest pluripotent and lineage-committing factors in a neural progenitor differentiation assay. The methods developed will contribute significant theoretical advances as well as reveal common mechanisms of stem cells and tumor biology to shed light on new treatment options for cancer.",New Integrative Pathway Analysis Methods to Predict Biomedical Outcomes,9518958,R01GM109031,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Embryo', 'Equilibrium', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Biology', 'Undifferentiated', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell type', 'daughter cell', 'developmental disease', 'drug sensitivity', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic manipulation', 'human model', 'human stem cells', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'neoplastic cell', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stem cell biology', 'stemness', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R01,2018,580609,0.05641903225879954
"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease networks are complex interactions between multiple proteins. Precise understanding of the multifactorial perturbations imposed on multi-component networks is a crucial step in the development of a rational approach to drug discovery and personalization of therapy.

"Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of the Data Generation Aim is to produce high quality data measuring phenotypes, protein and phosphoproteomics, and RNA expression in 30 cell lines grown on diverse microenvironments (ME). This approach will significantly enhance the LINCS data matrix by providing phenotypic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data for cell lines under unique ME conditions. Furthermore, the data will be utilized for subsequent generation of cellular network signatures in the Data Analysis Aim. Sub aim 1.1 will be generate 10 different phenotypic endpoints for 30 cell lines grown on 3,060 MEs. We will utilize Microenvironment    Microarrays (MEMA) to assess the effects of the ME on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation state, cell binding, and motility in each cell line. Statistical analysis will identify 50 significnt MEs for validation each year in years 2-6 in sub aim 1.2.A (total of 250 conditions). Each of the 50 ME conditions will be re-tested with the same endpoints at a second site using MEMA technology to provide independent validation of the primary results. At the same time, the cells will be tested using the 50 ME conditions on a second set of arrays designed to model the elastic modulus of human tissues to determine the effects on phenotypes of the matrix stiffness. From the 50 conditions tested in the validation aims, 30 of the most concordant between the primary and validation sites will be selected annually for analysis by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) aim 1.2.B and RNA expression analysis (aim I.2.C.). The RPPA aim will produce data using 500 validated antibodies against proteins and phosphoproteins in key signaling pathways under each of the ME perturbations. The RNA expression analysis will examine 1000 key genes using Luminex bead technology developed by the LINCS group at the Broad Institute, who will perform the same analysis for us using RNA prepared from each of the cell lines grown under the ME conditions. In total, the RPPA and RNA expression analysis will generate data for 150 different ME conditions under 2 different elastic moduli. All data will be carefully curated, with extensive metadata collected, and provided to the LINCS community for populating the data matrix.         Public Health Relevance: The main goals of the data generation aim will be to populate the LINCS data matrix with unique information that is currently not present in the matrix, and to provide data for generation of cellular network signatures.

"In situ transcriptome profiling in single cells Summary We have recently developed intron seqFISH (sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization) to multiplex 10,421 genes directly in single cells. We showed that the 10,421 gene nascent transcriptome profile can identify cell types as well as capture the trajectory of the cells. We further demonstrated that we can perform mRNA seqFISH as well as immunostaining in the same cells following the 10,421 gene intron seqFISH measurement. We propose to develop this technology as a potential alternative approach to single cell RNAseq for the HuBMAP to characterize cell types directly in situ in tissues. In particular, we will adept in situ amplification methods such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to intron seqFISH. We had previously shown that mRNA seqFISH with HCR amplification performs exceptionally in tissues in overcoming autofluorescence background and enable robust decoding seqFISH barcodes. We will validate the integrated intron and mRNA seqFISH protocol in the mouse hippocampus in the UG3 phase of the project. Also in UG3 phase, we will develop computational tools to integrate intron seqFISH data with mRNA seqFISH as well as single cell RNAseq data. In the UH3 phase, we will translate the technology to human tissues, with a focus on human mammary tissues provided by Dr. Seewaldt at City of Hope. We will also work with the tissue mapping centers in the HuBMAP program to accelerate the translation of this technology to many tissue types. In the UH3 phase, we will generate million cell spatial atlas of human tissues containing intron profiles, mRNA profiles and protein abundances in each single cell. We will further develop computational tools to analyze for spatial enrichment of genes in the tissue and generate a pseudotime of developmental trajectories using the nascent transcriptome data. Taken together, we will develop a high throughput in situ imaging based platform to characterize cell types and future trajectories of cells using intron and mRNA seqFISH technologies. Narrative Transcriptome profiling in situ at the single cell level has transformative potential for understanding healthy versus diseased tissues in the human body. We propose an integrative approach profiling the nascent transcriptome as well as hundreds of mature transcripts in single cells in tissues. We will generate million cell spatial atlas for the mouse hippocampus as well as the human mammary tissue. We will gain unprecedented insight into the developmental of neurons in the brain as well as the duct cells in the breast.

"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease. Computational methods that can identify regulatory networks and their dynamics across related mammalian cell types offer a powerful approach to create better models of human disease and for regenerative medicine.",Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages,9517972,R01GM117339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Distal', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signaling Protein', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Validation', 'cell fate specification', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human model', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'promoter', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,293249,0.0557937586473777
"Niche signals in HSC genesis PROJECT SUMMARY Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have well established clinical applications in the treatment of heritable and acquired blood disorders. However, their therapeutic potential could be significantly broadened by engineering novel methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells or from directly reprogrammed adult cells. Toward this goal, we have established endothelial cell (EC) niche based culture methods that provide the necessary conditions to support the specification and self-renewal of HSC from embryonic hemogenic precursors, and more recently, from adult ECs using transcription factor (TF)-mediated conversion that bypasses a pluripotent intermediate. We hypothesize that recreating the signals necessary and sufficient to develop a clinically meaningful system for HSC generation in vitro will necessitate a comprehensive, systems approach to deconstruct the niche provided signals required for HSC specification and self-renewal. Thus, the overall goal of this grant is to leverage unique expertise of the collaborating laboratories to elucidate the signaling interactions regulating HSC specification and self-renewal from embryonic hemogenic precursors or TF-reprogrammed adult EC in the context of the EC niche. Our approach consists of three overlapping aims. The first aim will identify EC niche-provided signals necessary for embryonic HSC specification and self-renewal. The second aim will identify the unique HSC programs induced by these signals that regulate the transition from embryonic hemogenic precursor to bone fide repopulating HSC. The third will identify comparable programs that regulate the transition from adult EC to HSC during TF-mediated reprogramming in the EC niche. Key to these studies will be innovative functional assays, transcriptional profiling methods, and computational approaches that will enable us to resolve cellular complexity of niche cells and their interactions with developing embryonic or reprogrammed HSC at the single cell level. The role of identified signal factors in stage-specific support of HSC specification will be validated and further refined in vitro by gain and loss of function studies in the context of niche EC. Furthermore, to extend these studies to stromal cell-free systems as a step toward clinical translation, we will also test the contribution of identified signal factors in HSC specification and self-renewal in the context of stage-specific modulation of Notch activation using engineered Notch agonists. To achieve the goals of this proposal, we have developed a multidisciplinary collaboration involving unique expertise in each of our laboratories, including basic HSC and EC niche cell biology, direct TF based cellular conversion, clinical HSC transplantation, genome wide assessment of rare stem cell populations at single cell resolution, and innovative computational approaches to deconstruct core signal pathways regulating developmental transitions. Altogether, we expect the proposed studies will ultimately guide the design of novel strategies for deriving and expanding HSC in vitro for therapeutic applications. NARRATIVE Hematopoietic stem cells are currently used in the treatment and cure of a variety of blood disorders. Methods to generate new or greater numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in the laboratory could expand the availability and therapeutic applications of these valuable cells, but currently such methods are lacking. The goal of this proposal is to use lessons from endothelial cells, which provide critical signals to support hematopoietic stem cells, to engineer novel systems for the development and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in culture. !",Niche signals in HSC genesis,9547399,RC2DK114777,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Aorta', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Development', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gonadal structure', 'Grant', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mesonephric structure', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological Processes', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Stem Cell Development', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'base', 'blastomere structure', 'bone', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'receptor', 'self-renewal', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem', 'stem cell fate specification', 'stem cell population', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,RC2,2018,644332,0.10102801569027012
"Spatial Genomics for in situ single cell expression analysis in the brain Summary Identifying the spatial organization of tissues at cellular resolution from single cell gene expression profiles is essential to understanding neurological systems. We have developed a spatial genomics approach that allows in situ 3D multiplexed imaging of many genes in single cells called sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH). This technology can profile transcriptional states of single cells directly in their native tissue context with up to 249 genes multiplexed with single molecule sensitivity on each gene. We have demonstrated over 15,000 cells profiled in mouse brain slices. This SBIR project will be focused on the design, production and optimization of an instrument that allows hundreds of genes to be multiplexed and imaged in single cells within their native tissue context. The resulting machine will be commercially launched and targeted to imaging or sequencing cores at research institutions. We will design the hardware, code the control software, and build the prototype instrument. We will engineer the hardware component including automated fluidics and multiple camera imaging system with a parallel effort to develop software controls as well as integrated analysis tools. In phase II, we will beta-test the instrument, generate probe sets for gene panels targeting different brain samples, and receive valuable feedback from users and optimize our instrument design.

"Quantitative SRS Imaging of Cancer Metabolism at Single Cell Level Project summary: Although altered cell metabolism is becoming an established hallmark of cancer, there remains a crucial need of new tools for quantitation of metabolites at single living cell level. In particular, due to lack of specific labels for metabolites, there is an unmet need for high-resolution imaging tools capable of mapping metabolites and small molecules (fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids) that play essential roles in pathogenesis of cancer. Supported by a R21 grant through the IMAT program, our team partially addressed this need via developing a multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, which enabled vibrational imaging of metabolites in live tumor cells and intact biopsies at the speed of 5 microseconds per spectrum. This R33 application aims to push the hyperspectral stimulated Raman imaging technology to the next level through (i) technical simplification and validation, (ii) developing a robust hyperspectral image segmentation framework, and (iii) integrating the SRS modality with a commercial spontaneous Raman microscope towards broad use by non-experts. We have assembled an inter-disciplinary team for the proposed development. The three specific aims are: (1) Developing an easy-to-operate, highly sensitive line-by-line hyperspectral SRS microscope and validate its capacity for cancer metabolic imaging at single cell level. (2) Establishing a feature analysis framework for segmentation of hyperspectral SRS images using the non-parametric Bayesian model. (3) Integrating and validating the stimulated Raman imaging modality on a spontaneous Raman microscope. By completing the proposed development and validation activities, we will have generated a highly novel spectroscopic imaging system broadly applicable to analysis of chemical contents of cells and tissues for discovery-driven research and marker- based precision diagnosis.

"Discovery and characterization of novel ciliopathy protein complexes Abstract Ciliopathies are a collection of debilitating developmental disorders (e.g. Joubert syndrome, Meckel syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, orofaciodigital syndrome, polycystic kidney disease) which have no cures and limited but expensive treatments. Diagnosis and treatment is complicated due to ciliopathies causing multisystem pathologies and having large variance in their clinical presentations potentially resulting in neural tube defects, orofacial clefting, obesity, polycystic kidneys, retinal degeneration and in some cases, infant death. All ciliopathies are caused by dysfunctional cilia, the microtubule based organelle critical for cell-to-cell signaling, but currently there is limited understanding of the underlying molecular network responsible for proper cilia function. Recently, large-scale proteomic techniques have advanced where it is now possible to query the cell's molecular network and identify many new protein complexes. This proposal describes a research program that will 1) construct a ciliary complex map using proteomic techniques, 2) functionally characterize newly discovered ciliary complexes and 3) identify disruptions in complex assembly due to known ciliopathy mutations. Additional products of the proposed research will include a compendium of proteomic data on ciliated cells, statistical analysis tools for the discovery of protein complexes, functional characterization of critical ciliary processes and a more complete understanding of the underlying molecular network of ciliopathy disease states. This work aims to provide an important perspective of cilia biology in order to better understand the complex etiology and molecular causes of ciliopathies and potentially open new therapeutic avenues. Project Narrative Ciliopathies are a class of debilitating birth defects without known cures and limited but expensive treatments. Currently, we lack understanding of the underlying molecular network in ciliopathy patient cells and know even less about the causes of clinical presentations in ciliopathy patients.

"Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics ABSTRACT Neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) have been historically categorized into discrete ""types"" based on structure, physiological responses, connectivity patterns, and molecular profiles. Heterogeneity can have other consequences- e.g. recent studies have found that some neuronal types in the retina are more resilient than other types to optic nerve injury, an event that leads to irrecoverable damage in vision. My project combines cutting-edge single-cell genomic technologies, advanced computational data analysis and molecular tools to define heterogeneity of neuronal types comprehensively, to connect molecular definitions to histology, and explore the functional consequences of this heterogeneity during nerve injury. I will focus on a tractable system, the mouse retina, which communicates visual responses to the brain. It is as complex as any other region of the brain (containing ~120 neuronal types), but benefits from having a compact, accessible structure, and experimental tools make it especially suited for detailed analyses. Building on my previous postdoctoral work, this project will, 1) Complete the census of the mouse retina, which will the first for any CNS region, by inferring molecular taxonomies of two of its most heterogenous classes (amacrines and ganglion cells) from data collected using high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using the mouse census, initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, which is harder to access experimentally, but shares important features with humans that are absent in mice. 2) Conduct a systematic investigation of cell-type specific responses in the retina to optic nerve injury. This usually leads to a rapid, stereotypic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but a recent study by my colleagues reported that some RGC types are more resilient than others. Here, using 1) as a resource, I will identify factors, cell intrinsic and extrinsic, that make these RGC types resilient. 3) Selective resilience of cell types is now recognized as a feature of diseases like glaucoma and stroke. Therapies therefore need to cater to different cell types. To learn more, and derive general principles, I will examine the impact of known therapeutic interventions on the survival of different RGC types, and the underlying molecular responses, within the optic nerve injury model. Taken together, my project will derive substantial molecular information underlying neuronal heterogeneity in the mouse and macaque retina and general principles for cell-type selective resilience following CNS injury in mice. The lessons from this work will provide valuable guidance for similar studies in less accessible regions of the brain (e.g. cerebral cortex).   NARRATIVE The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of a large diversity of neuronal types, a major proportion of which remain to be identified and defined in terms of molecular markers so that their roles in function and dysfunction can be assessed. This project seeks to combine high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics, innovative computational and histological methods to comprehensively define neuronal heterogeneity in an accessible system – the mouse retina, and use this as a foundation to (1) initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, and (2) study cell-type specific responses in a tractable model of nerve injury (optic nerve crush) to map the resilience of different cell types, and identify molecular correlates underlying these differences. Our work will create transformational tools to address similar challenges in other CNS regions.","Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics",9431808,K99EY028625,"['Address', 'Amacrine Cells', 'Animal Model', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cessation of life', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Crush', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Injuries', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'central nervous system injury', 'design', 'ganglion cell', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'molecular marker', 'nerve injury', 'neuroprotection', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'retinal neuron', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stroke-like episode', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NEI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2018,107618,0.05446499553307485
"Formation and function of lamellipodial morphology in 3D microenvironments Project Summary Dendritic cells are the sentinels of the immune system. They patrol the body looking for antigens and then migrate to a lymph node to communicate what they found to T cells and other cells of the adaptive immune system. These professional migrators and searchers are a critical component of human immunity, and their migration is targeted or hijacked by multiple pathogens including some pox and herpes viruses, tuberculosis, and anthrax. Since dendritic cells can activate cytotoxic T cells to attack cancer cells, their migration also plays a role in cancer immunotherapy strategies. Many cells, including dendritic cells, migrate by extending lamellipodia. Lamellipodia are thin, planar protrusions that have been extensively studied for cells migrating on 2D surfaces, such as glass coverslips. Dendritic cells use lamellipodia to find a path through crowded 3D environments and to enter lymphatic vessels. Lamellipodia and the actin network that composes them have been studied for decades. However, most molecularly detailed models of lamellipodia regulation and function were derived from studying cells on 2D surfaces, so we still do not know how cells initiate and extend lamellipodia in 3D environments. Dr. Driscoll will investigate how actin nucleators organize to generate sheet- like lamellipodial morphologies in the absence of a surface to guide their generation, as well as how actin nucleators organize to direct the extension of lamellipodia within crowded 3D environments. As a model of dendritic cell migration through peripheral tissues, she will study their migration though 3D fibrous collagen matrices. Widely available microscopic techniques, such as confocal microscopy, cannot image cells in 3D collagen with the spatial and temporal resolution required to measure the organization of actin nucleators in lamellipodia. However, recently developed techniques, such as light-sheet microscopy, are just beginning to be able to do so. Since light-sheet microscopes can easily produce 3D movies exceeding 1TB in size, interpreting and even simply visualizing such large amounts of data requires sophisticated computing workflows. Although Dr. Driscoll has recently developed computational tools to analyze light-sheet microscopy images, to utilize these tools she needs further training in building and using light-sheet microscopes. The Danuser and Fiolka labs at UT Southwestern are ideal locations to obtain this training. Dr. Gaudenz Danuser is an expert at developing computer vision tools to address cell biology questions, whereas Dr. Reto Fiolka is specialized in light-sheet microscopy of 3D systems. The training Dr. Driscoll receives will enable her to lead an independent laboratory that focuses on how cells migrate through and interact with their 3D environment. In summary, Dr. Driscoll will integrate light-sheet microscopy, 3D image analysis, and molecular biology techniques to determine how lamellipodia form and function in 3D environments. Project Narrative Cell migration is critical to many physiological and pathological processes, including embryogenesis, wound healing, immune function, and cancer metastasis. Lamellipodia are thin, sheet-like protrusions that facilitate cell migration in diverse environments. This project combines high-resolution light-sheet microscopy, computer vision, and molecular biology techniques to study the formation and function of lamellipodia in 3D fibrous matrices.",Formation and function of lamellipodial morphology in 3D microenvironments,9527427,K99GM123221,"['Actins', 'Adaptive Immune System', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Anthrax disease', 'Antigens', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular biology', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Fiber', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Coupling', 'Crowding', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Diffusion', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Fibroblasts', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Glass', 'Grant', 'Herpesviridae', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphatic vessel', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Morphology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neural Crest Cell', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Poxviridae', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'Wound Healing', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'computerized tools', 'imaging modality', 'immune function', 'in vivo', 'light microscopy', 'lymph nodes', 'macrophage', 'microscopic imaging', 'migration', 'movie', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'polymerization', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIGMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2018,90000,0.0631547699283341
"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications. It is also aimed to study the fundamental sources of tumor heterogeneity.",An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity,9520067,K01ES025434,"['Acute Erythroblastic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Galaxy', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hawaii', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Sciences', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'career', 'college', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'leukemia', 'mRNA sequencing', 'methylome', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'restriction enzyme', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell sequencing', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,K01,2018,24211,0.07676863027874513
"Functional and transcriptional analysis of embryonic hematopoietic stem cell development at the single cell level PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The therapeutic potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) could be significantly enhanced by methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells (PSC) or reprogrammed adult cells. Thus, there has been great interest in understanding the embryologic origin of HSC and the signal pathways that guide HSC development and self-renewal, such that the process of HSC genesis can be recapitulated in vitro, a goal which has yet to be realized. Given the heterogeneity and developmental asynchrony in hemogenic precursors during their emergence in the embryo, to achieve this it will be necessary to develop better strategies to isolate and characterize the rare precursors capable of giving rise to HSC and to understand the signals that drive their development to functional, engrafting HSC. To this end, I have established that endothelial cells (EC) derived from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region (AGM), the niche in which the first HSC emerge, can promote the in vitro specification and self-renewal of engrafting HSC from hemogenic precursors, including recent studies at the single cell level. Furthermore, I have shown that the Notch pathway functions in both specification and self-renewal of HSC in the EC niche, and that use of immobilized Notch ligands to activate the Notch pathway, along with hematopoietic cytokines, is sufficient to induce expansion of embryonic HSC. Building upon this work, the goals of this proposal are to utilize this novel in vitro AGM-EC system to elucidate the phenotypic, molecular, and functional properties of HSC precursors as they transition to functional HSC capable of long-term, multilineage engraftment. This will require isolation and functional characterization of HSC precursors across different stages of their development at the single cell level (Aim 1), followed by single cell transcriptional analysis to determine the gene regulatory networks and molecular signals promoting their development to functional HSC (Aim 2A). In studies working toward the engineering of stromal cell-free systems for HSC generation, agonists of identified signaling pathways will be functionally tested for their capacity to support HSC development in conjunction with the known requirement for Notch signaling activation (Aim 2B). Altogether, these studies will provide novel insight into the unique properties of HSC precursors, as well at the signaling mechanisms governing their maturation to functional HSC, which will have important implications in advancing our ability to generate HSC from PSC. To accomplish these aims, I will leverage the wealth of resources available in the mentoring laboratory of Dr. Bernstein, as well as key resources available at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the University of Washington, and Seattle Children’s Hospital, and opportunities for co-mentorship from Dr. Shahin Rafii at the Ansary Stem Cell Institute at Weill Cornell Medical College. A key aspect of my career development plan is to also acquire new skills that will facilitate my research objectives, including techniques in single cell RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis which will be performed in collaboration with and under the co-mentorship of Dr. Cole Trapnell in Genome Sciences at the University of Washington. This type of interdisciplinary training will provide me with the tools necessary to apply innovative technologies in unravelling the complexity of niche- stem cell interactions that instruct HSC fates. My research experience studying hematopoietic stem cell development has provided me with a strong background to facilitate success in the proposed research goals. My clinical experience in caring for children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has cemented a strong passion to expand scientific knowledge of HSC and translate this knowledge to improve therapies for children with hematologic, immunologic, and oncologic diseases. Success in my research and career development goals outlined in this proposal will enable me to establish an independent academic career as a physician-scientist with the skills to lead a diverse research team and collaborate broadly to address essential questions in stem cell biology. Ultimately, my long-term goal is to develop a laboratory-based career with focus on taking fundamental principles discovered through basic research in developmental HSC biology toward clinical applications in hematopoietic stem cell therapeutics.

"Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease SPATIAL EPIGENOMIC PROFILING OF IMMUNE CELL SIGNATURES AT SUBCELLULAR  RESOLUTION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE More than ten percent of childhood cancers are still incurable and need novel therapies. Epigenetic treatments deserve special attention with their specificity and reduced toxicity. Here I plan to explore epigenetic profiles of immune and cancer cells in normal development and blood cancer patients under the mentorship of Garry Nolan for single cell proteomics technology development, in collaboration with Howard Chang for implementation of epigenomic methods such as chromosome accessibility assays, and with Kara Davis for epigenetics studies of treatment resistant B cell subtypes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epigenetic measurements have been limited to bulk level sequencing and ligation assays or limited number of imaging markers. To address these limitations, I will use an emerging three dimensional (3D) proteomic imaging technology in individual cells, termed as 3D Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) or 3D MIBI. Epigenetics research by 3D MIBI benefits from high degree multiplexing (up to 100 markers) and super resolution imaging capability (20 nm x-y; 5 nm z resolution), providing exciting opportunities to study genomic sites, methylated DNA, protein factors, and chromosome accessibility, all within the same experiments in single immune and aberrant (leukemic) cells. To systematically determine epigenetic states, I plan to utilize clonal B cell lines to decipher variability of epigenetic components including chromatin states, protein factors and modifiers by a fifty-marker 3D MIBI panel (Aim 1). These experiments will show distribution of epigenetic factors (linear or log-scale) in their expression levels and spatial variations (global or local) in the chromatin states. I will then perform experiments with primary B cells isolated from six different bone marrow aspirates of normal human subjects (Aim 2). I will correlate epigenetic signatures of each B cell subtype to corresponding development state (progenitor, pre, post, or mature). I will then perform an ex vivo co-culture of primary B cells on OP9 stromal cells over 1-6 weeks of culturing, which will be followed by fixation and profiling by 3D MIBI. These perturbation experiments will show how signaling events from neighboring cells drive necessary epigenetic conditions that are required for reaching a B cell subset. Finally, I will turn to primary B cells that are isolated from twenty newly diagnosed ALL patients (Aim 3). I will dissect differentiation and spatial epigenomic remodeling of responder B cell subsets and treatment resistant B cell subtypes from bone marrow aspirates using the OP9 co-culture. These will show how treatment resistance arises from a single epigenetic state or multiple distinct epigenetic signatures. I will then screen Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on the same co-culture of B cell subtypes from ALL and stromal cells. By varying concentration and duration of inhibition conditions, I will dissect the role of epigenetic drugs in spatial chromatin remodeling toward development of epigenetic therapies in ALL. Together, these experiments will shed light on the role of epigenetic programming for cancer treatment applications from immune cell signatures in normal subjects and blood cancer patients. Public Health Relevance: Epigenetic alterations in immune and cancer cells regulate normal development and aberrant formation in humans. We reveal spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes in epigenetic states of B cell subtypes from healthy and diseased subjects using a novel multiplex imaging mass cytometry. Deciphering the role of epigenetic perturbations in treatment resistant B cells will guide development of efficient and safe epigenetic therapies for pediatric blood cancers.",Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease,9582519,K25AI140783,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Aspirate substance', 'Attention', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood Hematopoietic Neoplasm', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Cytometry', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Four-dimensional', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Libraries', 'Ligation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Technology', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'chromatin remodeling', 'design', 'epigenetic drug', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging capabilities', 'lymphoblast', 'mathematical analysis', 'nanometer', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pediatric patients', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'sample fixation', 'shape analysis', 'single cell analysis', 'success', 'technology development', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K25,2018,107880,-0.009073280142545975
"Phenotypes of Aging & Senescence The PHenotypes of Aging and SEnescence (PHASE) study will develop a panel of markers in plasma that reflect cell senescence. Senescence is a fundamental process of biological aging whereby cells irreversibly stop dividing senescent cells. They secrete products, the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) and play a pivotal role in age-related diseases and survival. The partial elimination of senescent cells by senolytic treatments reverses age-related dysfunction and increases mean lifespan in mice. Treatments that reduce senescent cells are now being tested in clinical trials so there is an urgent need for a panel of markers of senescence to test and compare the efficacy of candidate treatments and identify individuals who, because of a high burden of senescence, are most likely to benefit from such treatment. PHASE will follow a decision tree with four phases to systematically identify, select, optimize, and clinically validate panels of circulating markers of cell senescence. In the first phase we will assemble a comprehensive panel of candidate markers from extensive research on senescence by our team and others’ research. In the second phase we will select a provisional research panel of SASP markers for studies of clinical endpoints based on evidence that the marker reflects underlying cell senescence because it increases with aging, is correlated with senescent cell burden in several tissues, and is reduced by senolytic treatments. In the third phase we will test and optimize the assays. In the fourth phase we will test the associations between the markers and several clinical outcomes, such as osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease using plasma and data from the Health ABC cohort study. We will also test the association between the markers and healthspan – survival free of disability and dementia, and reaching over age 100 years. PHASE will provide a panel of markers reflecting cell senescence that can be widely used in clinical research, clinical trials and clinical practice to target treatments that could slow the process of aging, reduce the risk of many disabling and fatal aging-related conditions, and increase healthspan. The PHenotypes of Aging and SEnescence (PHASE) study will develop a panel of markers for the process of cell senescence, a fundamental biological process of aging in which cells stop dividing and begin to secrete products that impair the function of other cells and tissues. Treatments that partly eliminate senescent cells, ‘senolytics,’ reduce effects of aging and prolong life in mice and are now being tested in humans. PHASE will produce markers that can be used to test the efficacy of new treatments in humans and identify people who are most likely to benefit from senolytic therapy.",Phenotypes of Aging & Senescence,9788802,R56AG060907,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Bone Density', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Aging', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Centenarian', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fracture', 'Functional disorder', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knee', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Measurement', 'MicroRNAs', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'New England', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Renal Glycosuria', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Skin', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'burden of illness', 'candidate marker', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative efficacy', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'fragility fracture', 'glucose metabolism', 'health data', 'healthspan', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'pleiotropism', 'post gamma-globulins', 'pre-clinical', 'senescence']",NIA,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R56,2018,683773,0.03047975855776725
"The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease Most investigations of craniosynostosis focus on the dermatocranium, the second cranial skeleton to form during embryogenesis that comprises the dermal bones of the cranial vault and facial skeleton. A completely separate cranial skeleton, the chondrocranium, develops before the dermatocranium to support the embryonic brain and other sense organs. Historically, the chondrocranium has been studied across the vertebrates and is recognized as fundamental to craniofacial development, but it is not well known to craniofacial biologists and has never been studied in the laboratory mouse until now. The chondrocranium is formed of cartilage and though parts of it ossify endochondrally, other portions begin to degenerate by about embryonic day 15-16 in the mouse. By careful analysis of whole mount and histological specimens, we have documented the synchronized deterioration of select chondrocranial elements with the appearance and superimposition of particular dermal bones of the growing dermatocranium. These observations signal the existence of a mechanism for the coordinated, localized expansion (dermal bones) and resorption (cartilage) of two developmentally and evolutionarily separate skeletal systems. Our project, supported by strong preliminary data of the mouse chondrocranium, is designed to test a central hypothesis: that the chondrocranium serves as a structural and functional scaffold for the later development of dermatocranial elements including the formation of cranial vault sutures. Based on the common finding that boundaries between different cell populations often serve as tissue organizers, we recognize the establishment and maintenance of stable boundaries that restrict the mixing of different cell populations as critical to proper development, and propose a research design that interrogates the chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundary as significant to the coordinated development of the skull. We will interrogate cells at specific sites to determine the processes that function to maintain the boundaries. Then using the Fgfr2c+/C342Y mouse model for craniosynostosis, we will investigate relevant chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundaries operative in the development of two craniosynostosis phenotypes: premature closure of the coronal suture and abnormal growth of the midface. That the chondrocranium is composed of irregularly shaped cartilages, many of which are short-lived, requires that we conceive new tools for analysis. We will complete development of an innovative system to dissect and reconstruct the chondrocranium in silico from micro computed tomography images with tight temporal control, precisely delineate chondrocranial anatomy in 3D over embryonic time, and establish the role of the chondrocranium in development of the dermatocranium. Achieving our goals will enrich textbook knowledge of craniofacial development by defining the role of the chondrocranium in the production of dermatocranial phenotypes, provide information relative to the pathophysiology of countless craniofacial anomalies, and reveal potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. Craniofacial anomalies are common birth defects that require comprehensive, sometimes repetitive corrective surgeries to manage individual cases. To ameliorate the financial and emotional burden on patients and their families, efforts are aimed at the development of preventative therapies but these require a thorough understanding of craniofacial development. We offer novel information about the chondrocranium, the first embryonic cranial skeleton to develop, and focus on mechanisms operating within boundaries between it and the dermatocranium that are critical to craniofacial development, in normal individuals and in craniofacial disease.",The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease,9496083,R01DE027677,"['Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Apert-Crouzon syndrome', 'Apoptosis', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Birth', 'Bone Resorption', 'Brain', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Chondrichthyes', 'Chondrocranium', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Embryonic Structures', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory mice', 'Live Birth', 'Maintenance', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Osteoblasts', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sense Organs', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal system', 'Skeleton', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vertebrates', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cleft lip and palate', 'coronal suture', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fibroblast growth factor receptor 2c', 'histological specimens', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'osteogenic', 'premature', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIDCR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2018,533846,0.016074240444968142
"Quantitative molecular and cellular MRI of hepatocyte transplantation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  For many severe liver diseases, the only effective treatment is liver transplantation. Unfortunately, due to the shortage of available donor organs, or the patient's age, liver transplantation is not available to all patients. Hepatocyte transplantation (HTx) is an alternative, experimental treatment, with limited long term success in humans. A major unsolved question is how can we dynamically monitor and quantify cell transplantation in HTx to help improve HTx and to closely monitor clinical implementation?  To answer this question, we combine an innovative molecular and cellular MRI approach, with machine learning and computer vision, to non-invasively quantify cell engraftment and long term engraftment and repopulation (LTER) in the liver following HTx. Using a mouse model that facilitates LTER following HTx, we will use this combined approach to quantify transplanted cells in the liver at Days 1 and 7 after HTx, reflecting the timings of initial cell delivery (Day 1) and actual cellular engraftment in the tissue (Day 7). Then, we will measure LTER of these cells in the liver 30 - 90 days post-transplant, making innovative use of Eovist, an FDA approved MRI contrast agent specific for healthy hepatocytes. These experiments will evaluate mouse donor cells, as well as pig primary hepatocytes and pig embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocyte cell line.  This transformative work will be the first study to achieve this level of quantification wit molecular and cellular MRI of regenerative medicine, in any animal model. Additionally, we will test pattern recognition algorithms aimed at predicting the outcome of LTER, at an early stage. The capability to predict LTER outcome would be paradigm shifting as it would enable physicians to consider additional HTx regimens or second line treatments if HTx fails. This is seldom possible.  Though this project will be developed on mice, clinical translation of the imaging protocol would be straightforward because the exact imaging and data analysis scheme that we use to measure HTx in mouse, can be used to measure HTx in humans. Eovist is FDA approved for use in humans with liver disease, and MRI-based cell tracking of iron labeled cells is in clinical trials. Our preliminary data strongly suggests that MRI and data analysis can discriminate single cells at 200 µm resolution, meaning the MRI could likely be performed on any high field human MRI system. Additionally, the discovery that a stem cell-derived hepatocyte achieved even partial LTER would be extremely encouraging for exploring human and/or pig stem cell-derived hepatocytes for human use, because these cells can potentially alleviate the crucial issue of poor cell supply, similar to progress seen in pig islet transplant.  The proposed research takes a multidisciplinary approach with expertise in hepatocyte transplant and biology, molecular imaging, machine learning/computer vision, and mouse liver disease models. Collaboration among the researchers is ongoing with extensive preliminary data across all aspects of the proposed work. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of hepatocyte transplantation as an alternative to whole liver transplant requires non-invasive methodologies for monitoring the fate of transplanted cells.

"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis.

"High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is one of the most important tools for high-throughput single cell analysis. Fluorescent labeling acts as the primary approach for cellular analysis in flow cytometry. Nevertheless, fluorescent tags are not applicable to all cases especially small molecules (e.g. metabolites) for which labeling may significantly perturb their properties. Raman spectroscopic signals arising from inherent molecular vibrations provide a key approach to detect specific molecules inside cells and to differentiate cellular state. Raman-based microfluidic devices have been reported. However, the very small cross section of spontaneous Raman scattering results in low Raman signal level and consequently long data acquisition time, which is not compatible with the high- speed flow condition. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to establish a high-throughput high-content single cell analysis platform using molecular fingerprint vibrations as contrast. The specific objective of current application is to develop a vibrational spectroscopic cytometer based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process. Several recent advances in the Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) lab, including the highly sensitive femtosecond SRS imaging, lock-in free SRS signal detection and a tuned amplifier array for multiplex SRS imaging, pave the foundation for the planned instrumentation. The PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team for the proposed study. Dr. J. Paul Robinson (co-PI) is a leader in development and applications of fluorescence-based flow cytometer and he will bring expertise to the design of fluidics and multichannel detection systems. Dr. Bartek Rajwa (co-PI) will provide expertise for spectroscopic cytometry data analysis and machine learning. The team will design and construct a SRS flow cytometer by multichannel detection of dispersed SRS signal (Aim 1), construct a tandem system able to collect SRS and fluorescence data (Aim 2), develop spectral un-mixing and machine-learning analysis tools able to combine the information obtained from SRS spectra and labeled biomarkers for functional classification of cells (Aim 3), and validate the capability of SRS flow cytometer for label-free detection of single-cell metabolism (Aim 4). With a speed of analyzing thousands of cells per second, SRS flow cytometer will enable high-throughput analysis of single-cell chemical content which is beyond the reach by fluorescence-based flow cytometer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build a high-throughput single cell analysis platform through multiplex stimulated Raman scattering detection of single flowing cells at microsecond time scale. Having fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering detection in tandem, our platform is capable of discovering new metabolic signatures of cell subpopulations (e.g. cancer stem cells sorted through fluorescent markers). Such discovery could potentially lead to new development of disease-specific treatment strategies.",High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry,9320713,R01GM118471,"['Amplifiers', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Energy Transfer', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nanostructures', 'Optics', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quartz', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tube', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'cancer stem cell', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'design and construction', 'detector', 'electric impedance', 'high throughput analysis', 'instrumentation', 'light scattering', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'photomultiplier', 'public health relevance', 'single cell analysis', 'small molecule', 'spectroscopic data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'vibration']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2017,403725,0.06763618688140195
"Mechanisms of mechanosensing through integrins Project Summary  Cells sense extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and physical forces applied through the ECM through integrin-mediated adhesions. These mechanotransduction processes play critical roles in embryonic development, normal physiology and multiple diseases, including cancer, hypertension, atherosclerosis and fibrosis among others. However, mechanical responses differ between cell types, between the same cell type in different states, and even in different regions of single cells. While much has been learned about mechanotransduction through integrins, a major area of ignorance is how different types and components of matrix adhesions modulate cell responses to force. The aim of this project is therefore to characterize the mechanosensing properties of distinct types and compositions of integrin mediated adhesions and elucidate the molecular basis for these differences.  A major limitation in our current understanding of mechanosensing by different types of adhesions is that current, morphology-based classifications into nascent, focal or fibrillary adhesions or focal complexes are imprecise, with little information about composition or structure. Additionally, adhesions in cells continuously evolve, so that actual adhesions are often mixtures of different types. Recent work has now defined specific molecular complexes that serve as modules for construction of different adhesion classes. Indeed, the data argue that adhesions have a modular structure with these protein complexes serving as the core modules that are combined and modified to generate diversity. Based on this hypothesis, we will: 1.Combine biochemical approaches with novel imaging and machine learning methods to elucidate the composition and behaviors of the distinct adhesion modules. 2.Utilize these biochemical and imaging methods in conjunction with assays of cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics and tension to characterize the cytoskeletal organization and dynamics for the distinct adhesion complexes. 3.Combine novel imaging and engineering approaches to characterize the distinct signaling properties of the different adhesion states and their responses to substrate stiffness and applied strain. Project Narrative Integrin mediated adhesions sense the mechanical properties of and forces applied through the extracellular matrix. A major area of ignorance in this field is how different types of adhesions differentially respond to mechanical information. One reason for this problem is our limited current understanding of the composition and structure of different types of adhesions. This multi-PO project will combine highly novel biochemical, imaging and image analysis, force measurement, mechanotransduction and signaling methods to develop a deeper understanding of the composition and structure of different adhesion types, and apply this information to understanding their cytoskeletal dynamics and mechanotransduction properties.",Mechanisms of mechanosensing through integrins,9311903,R01GM047214,"['Actomyosin', 'Adhesions', 'Admixture', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibrosis', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Integrins', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Talin', 'Vinculin', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mechanical properties', 'mechanotransduction', 'molecular imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'protein complex', 'response', 'sensor', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,412050,0.043383139925514715
"Deciphering the building blocks of hippocampal circuits   Abstract   Since  Ramon  y  Cajal,  neuroscientists  have  speculated  that  even  the  most  complex  brain  functions  might  eventually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. Unfortunately, our under‐ standing of the brain's extensive diversity of cell types and elaborate circuitry remains far from complete. For  example, despite the hippocampus being essential for learning and memory and its dysfunction underlying a  wide variety of devastating neuropsychiatric disorders, we still lack fundamental knowledge about its constit‐ uent cell types and their molecular profiles and connectivity, slowing progress towards a mechanistic circuit‐ level understanding of memory formation. We propose to identify all of the interneuron cell types in area CA1  of the hippocampus and decipher their canonical connectivity. We have assembled a strong interdisciplinary  team  capable  of  combining  cutting‐edge  technologies  including  high‐throughput  multi‐cell  patch  recordings,  morphological reconstructions, single‐cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to achieve two main goals:  1) dissect CA1 microcircuit organization by generating a morphological and electrophysiological taxonomy of  all interneuron cell types in mouse CA1 and map their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of  morphologically defined CA1 interneurons using our newly developed Patch‐seq method. Our team recently  implemented  this  interdisciplinary  experimental  strategy  to  successfully  identify  cell  types  in  the  neocortex  and dissect their microcircuitry. Using multi‐cell patch clamp recording, we will characterize the electrophysi‐ ological properties, morphology, laminar location and connectivity of thousands of neurons from mouse CA1  hippocampus. We will also utilize a new, highly sensitive, cost effective technique for single‐cell RNA sequenc‐ ing (Smart‐seq2) to map their transcriptomes and machine learning techniques to classify cells into molecular  types.  Importantly,  our  high‐throughput  method  will  allow  us  to  obtain

"Spatiotemporal Coordination of Actin Regulators and Traction Forces in Heterogeneous Cell Protrusions Project Summary/Abstract Cancer cells within tumors often exist in highly heterogeneous phenotypic states, which is a major challenge in cancer therapeutics. Although there have been great advances in studying cellular heterogeneity and discovering hidden phenotypes, little effort has been made in achieving mechanistic understandings of each phenotype in heterogeneous cell populations in living cells. Most of our understandings of cell biological processes are based on the ensemble average of experimental measurements drawn from cell population. However, biological systems are inherently heterogeneous even in isogenic cell cultures. One of the prominent examples of cellular/subcellular heterogeneity is cell protrusion, driven by actin polymerization pushing the leading edge plasma membrane. Actin cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic complex system which integrates numerous biochemical and mechanical signals. Hundreds of actin regulators collectively organize actin structures, which are spatiotemporally heterogeneous in micron length and minute time scales. Due to this heterogeneous issues, experimental outcomes are often context-dependent and difficult to interpret. Thus, it is necessary to develop a new quantitative live cell imaging method which allows us to achieve distinct molecular understandings of each cellular phenotype from heterogeneous cell population. Therefore, the goal of this project is to deconvolve the heterogeneity of cell protrusion to characterize each cellular/subcellular protrusive phenotype by combining quantitative live cell imaging and machine learning analysis, and we will determine the coordination of distinct sets of actin regulators with respect to each protrusive phenotype. This will lead to mechanistic understanding specific to each protrusive phenotype. The central hypothesis in this project is that heterogeneous cell protrusions are driven by the distinct sets of spatiotemporal coordinated actin regulators and traction forces at the leading edge. We will Evaluate how the coordination of actin regulators at the leading edge generates heterogeneous multiple protrusions (Aim 1). We will Evaluate how actin organization at the leading edge during the retraction generates reinforced multiple cell protrusion (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how the traction forces at the leading edge play roles in heterogeneous cell protrusions (Aim 3). It is expected that the experimental and computational imaging tools developed in this project can be applied to many complex cytoskeleton related processes including cellular morphogenesis by revealing a wide range of molecular and cellular coordination at various length and time scales. We also anticipate the new insight on cellular/subcellular heterogeneity in cell protrusion will allow us to better understand the heterogeneity of cancer metastasis, where only small number of tumor cells metastasize. Project Narrative This proposed project will be able to contribute to public health because new insight on the heterogeneity of cell protrusion will shed light on heterogeneity of cancer metastasis. This will allow us to find better therapeutic targets for more aggressive metastatic cells. The quantitative live cell imaging method developed in this project will enable the biomedical research community to tackle cellular heterogeneity to find more specific mechanism of specific phenotype.",Spatiotemporal Coordination of Actin Regulators and Traction Forces in Heterogeneous Cell Protrusions,9232608,R15GM122012,"['ANGPTL2 gene', 'Actins', 'Address', 'Atomic Force Microscopy', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Traction', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer therapy', 'cell motility', 'cofilin', 'computerized tools', 'depolymerization', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'live cell imaging', 'mortality', 'neoplastic cell', 'polymerization', 'population based', 'quantitative imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein']",NIGMS,WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R15,2017,449520,0.0786677687359656
"iFACS: Imaging Florescence Activated Cell Sorter to sort cells based on images iFACS: Imaging Florescence Activated Cell Sorter to sort cells based on images NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Advances in reagents (e.g. CRiSPR) and analytical tools (e.g. flow cytometers) have improved the ability to alter and characterize cellular phenotypes. Ultimately, many key applications in biomedicine require efficient and accurate isolation of cell populations according to features contained in high content images. Unfortunately, microscopic laser microdissection systems have a throughput that is too slow to be practical in many applications; while the existing flow cytometers that can sort cells (fluorescence-activated cell sorters or FACS) provide only size, internal complexity, and fluorescence intensity information and lack the rich data of imaging. Another critical limitation is that the existing flow cytometers that can image, cannot sort cells. NanoCellect has made a highly affordable FACS to increase access to this important high-throughput tool for cell analysis. Here we propose to enhance our existing low-cost FACS with the ability to image cells and sort them based on image features. This will allow users to pursue new strategies in drug screening and mechanism of action research; as well as work with suspension cell lines, such as those that dominate the recent advances in immuno-oncology. In Phase I research, we have demonstrated the world's first imaging flow cytometer with cell sorting capabilities (iFACS) in a unique design of space-time coding with an optical spatial filter. The approach adds negligible cost to the system for the desirable features of cell imaging and sorting. To fully realize the enormous potential of the design and to meet the demands for most applications, in Phase II we will develop high-throughput image-based cell sorting with innovative image-guided gating schemes supported by machine learning and interactive user/machine interface. Essentially, image-based flow cytometry gating uses similar cell isolation criteria as the techniques of laser capture microdissection or cell aspiration to isolate cells of interest, with 10,000X throughput improvements to 1000+ cells per second. We envision such unique capabilities will become common, default features for tomorrow's users as the tool becomes as intuitive and ubiquitous as fluorescent microscopy. The proposed iFACS will be transformative and benefit numerous biomedical applications, such as isolation of cells based on organelle translocation, cell cycle analyses, detection and counting of phagocytosed particles, and protein co-localization, to name just a few. iFACS: Imaging Florescence Activated Cell Sorter to sort cells based on images NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc.

"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular signatures of human neurons we identify can be used to provide insights into the molecular factors that distinguish central neurons from healthy people from those of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, SMA, PD and HD. These insights will provide molecular targets that can be used to develop new drugs to block the progression of these diseases which are presently untreatable.            ",Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells,9352374,U54NS091046,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alpha Cell', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Network-based', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Online Systems', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Scourge', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'disease-causing mutation', 'epigenomics', 'genome sequencing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach program', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,U54,2017,334000,0.08821222879734916
"Computational Modeling of Heterogeneous Gene Expression in Single Cells ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent development of single cell RNA-seq protocols enabled genomewide investigation of organismal systems at the cellular level, opening many new biological questions for study. Single cell resolution allows characterization of rare or unknown cell types, enables dissection of differentiation processes, and aids in decoding regulatory networks responsible for healthy and diseased states of cells. However, current single cell RNA-seq studies are limited by crucial gaps in existing computational methods.  We have devised strategies to address three key limitations of current single cell RNA-seq analysis methods: (1) lack of models for isoform-specific expression, (2) inability to link gene expression differences with measurable changes in cell function, and (3) lack of methods for studying sequential progression of gene expression changes. To address the first shortcoming, we developed SingleSplice, an algorithm for identifying genes whose isoform ratios vary more than expected by chance across a set of single cells (Aim 1). We have also developed a novel microraft platform that allows culturing, functional characterization, isolation, and subsequent sequencing of single cells. Using data generated from this platform, we will perform supervised machine learning to identify genes linked to functional differences among cells (Aim 2). To address the third limitation, we will use locally linear embedding, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, to identify ""trajectories"" of cells proceeding through sequential processes such as development and response to stimuli (Aim 3). We will apply our methods to our own data generated from microraft experiments, as well as publicly available single cell RNA-seq data from developing lung tissue and immune cells responding to immune stimulation.  Using data from experiments in which spike-in transcripts are added at constant, known amounts to cells to mimic an alternative splicing change, we found that SingleSplice detects isoform switching with high sensitivity (73%) and specificity (93%). We used microrafts to sequence single cells from a pancreatic cancer cell line and found that this approach produced high-quality data comparable to that from the Fluidigm C1. The microraft technology also enabled us to sequence RNA from pancreatic cancer cells after gemcitabine treatment and measure the proliferation of the cells, identifying both ""drug resistant"" cells that divide and cels that do not proliferate, giving a dataset with matched functional and transcriptomic measurements. Preliminary investigation of a dataset in which dendritic cells were stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shows that locally linear embedding (LLE) can order cells according to the length of time they have been exposed to LPS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Until very recently, studies have relied on aggregate measurements taken from bulk samples of cells, but in many important health-related applications, the information lost by lumping together thousands of cells poses a real barrier to understanding. Neurological conditions, cancer, and stem cell therapies are among the many areas that call for single cell RNA-seq methods. We propose to develop broadly applicable computational methods that will eliminate key limitations of current analyses and enable groundbreaking research in many domains important for public health.            ",Computational Modeling of Heterogeneous Gene Expression in Single Cells,9285609,F31HG008912,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drug resistance', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Glean', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Pancreas', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'experimental study', 'gemcitabine', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'pancreatic cancer cells', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell sequencing', 'stem cell therapy', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2017,11757,0.09864480766952965
"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers. Our goal is to show that the proposed multi-tissue platform can replicate the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients, and be used to develop better therapeutic regimens.",Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies,9401936,UG3EB025765,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Blood Substitutes', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myopathy', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Protective Agents', 'Proteins', 'Regimen', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Source', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'bone', 'circulating microRNA', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug testing', 'imaging modality', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic target']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,UG3,2017,1000,0.018077887928762224
"Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on “manual gating” of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 – Implement a novel computational infrastructure – FlowGate – for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 – Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 – Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 – Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community. Project Narrative Flow cytometry analysis is widely used for single cell phenotyping in the translational research lab to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes and in the clinical diagnostic lab for the identification and classification of blood-borne malignancies. However, the current practice for cytometry data analysis using “manual gating” based on two-dimensional data plots is subjective, labor-intensive and unreliable, especially when using more complex high content staining panels.

"Systems Analysis of cell type differentiation in Xenopus development Summary The pathways involved in embryonic development have been a rich resource for understanding disease in adults, as well as being critically important in tracing the effects of genetic lesions and environmental poisons in the fetus. Frog embryos have been particularly useful due to the large size of the frog egg and embryo. New tools we developed for measuring the expression of RNA at a single-cell level, and advances in protein and phosphopeptide measurement technologies, offer hope for dramatic progress in understanding how signals involved in the maturation of the embryo direct individual cells to adopt specific fates. Our first goal is to define cell types using single-cell transcriptomics, and to define the lineages that result in specific cell types using high resolution temporal mappings. Targeted transcriptomics and proteomics of important molecules involved in specifying cell fate, such as transcription factors, will provide an index of the levels of signaling activity in each individual cell. This will result in an unprecedentedly detailed molecular picture of the factors involved in producing the phenotypes, and their interconversions from the early cleavage stage to the middle of organogenesis. The Xenopus model system allows us to dissect out portions of the early embryo that differentiate to ectoderm if not disturbed, called the animal cap. In the context of the embryo the cells in the animal cap receive a number of developmental signals, including Nodal, BMP, and Wnt. Combinations of these three signals (in different proportions) are capable of generating many of the major tissues. We will expose animal caps to a matrix of these three signals and trace the differentiation pathways that result, using single-cell RNA sequencing. This study of the molecular roots of differentiation decisions will be used to develop a mathematical approach, based on machine learning, to predicting the results of an attempted perturbation of the development of Xenopus. We will ask whether cell types are carefully specified by tightly controlled combinations of ligands or whether there are default states that are hard to escape from (""basins of attraction""), that therefore form the majority of embryonic cell types. The answer to this question is central to our understanding of how the Xenopus embryo reliably develops into a frog, and will accelerate efforts to create computational methods to predict the behavior of other biological pathways such as those involved in cancer. Narrative The complexity of biology makes it hard to predict what effect a mutation or a drug will have. We will use new tools to measure when genes are expressed at the individual cell level throughout the course of development of a vertebrate embryo. This will give us new information on the cell types involved in tissue and organ formation, and will provide an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that we will use to develop a mathematical model of how the decision to become a specific cell type is made.",Systems Analysis of cell type differentiation in Xenopus development,9381417,R01HD073104,"['Activins', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Animal Cap', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm Cell', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Nodal', 'Organ', 'Organogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylated Peptide', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plant Roots', 'Poison', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'RNA library', 'Rana', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrometry', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Xenopus', 'Xenopus laevis', 'base', 'blastomere structure', 'cell type', 'cluster computing', 'course development', 'egg', 'embryo cell', 'experimental study', 'hatching', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'notochord', 'novel', 'phosphoproteomics', 'response', 'single cell proteins', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'vertebrate embryos', 'xenopus development']",NICHD,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2017,683755,0.12217143957684935
"New Integrative Pathway Analysis Methods to Predict Biomedical Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to reveal the key regulators that determine the usually ordered development of an animal from undifferentiated pluripotent cells to specialized cells that carry out all of the functions in our body. The coordinated expression of the genome underlies these processes and is orchestrated by networks of interacting genes that we are only beginning to unveil. Cell circuitry is complex but the discovery of the Yamanaka factors demonstrates that even less than a handful of transcription factors can exert profound changes on cell and tissue fates. Thus, the combinations of genes needed to unlock cell determinants seem tantalizingly parsimonious. Large-scale projects are underway to catalog the genomic, epigenomic, and functional genomic landscapes of many different cells in multiple different organisms. As high- throughput techniques such as DNA and RNA sequencing mature, there is an increase in demand for integrative approaches to elucidate the rules underlying intrinsic, adaptive, and programmed phenotypic changes that cells undergo that can be inferred from such data. Our starting point will be to extend the pathway integrative framework developed over the past several years for the interpretation of cancer genomics datasets for the Cancer Genome Atlas project. Extensions to the input pathways used, and advances in the model to enrich the formal representation, will be developed so that a breadth of datasets in human and model organisms can be analyzed. The approach will culminate in the combining of machine-learning classification with probabilistic graphical models. The classifiers will identify predictive pathway features for cell state distinctions in a large database. Genetic manipulations among these features can then be proposed, in any combination, as formal interventions on the graphical model of the resulting classifiers, a major advantage of this work. The pathway models will be applied to the prediction of factors that can confer differentiation and de-differentiation queues to human cortical neurons. Computationally predicted gene perturbations in this system will be tested in living cells. Identifying critical modulators of the cell fate decisions underlying the conversion of stem cells to neural progenitors to mature neural cell types will advance our understanding of neural development. These same regulators may also play an important role in glioma, a disease where the tumor cells appear to be in a neural progenitor-like state. Taken together, the proposed theoretical and applied informatics approaches will contribute powerful tools for interpreting and predicting both routine and aberrant cellular responses. Researchers will be able to query the complex networks with computer algorithms as high fidelity surrogates. In the not so distant future, our hope is to advance our understanding of normal differentiation and shed light on how the regulation of these programs breaks down in disease processes like cancer, shedding light on diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to extend machine-learning and probabilistic graphical modeling approaches developed in the field of cancer genomics to the analysis of a broad range of human and model organism datasets. Novel methods for proposing genetic perturbations using a formal computational analysis will be developed and tested for their ability to suggest pluripotent and lineage-committing factors in a neural progenitor differentiation assay.

"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease networks are complex interactions between multiple proteins. Precise understanding of the multifactorial perturbations imposed on multi-component networks is a crucial step in the development of a rational approach to drug discovery and personalization of therapy.

"Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of the Data Generation Aim is to produce high quality data measuring phenotypes, protein and phosphoproteomics, and RNA expression in 30 cell lines grown on diverse microenvironments (ME). This approach will significantly enhance the LINCS data matrix by providing phenotypic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data for cell lines under unique ME conditions. Furthermore, the data will be utilized for subsequent generation of cellular network signatures in the Data Analysis Aim. Sub aim 1.1 will be generate 10 different phenotypic endpoints for 30 cell lines grown on 3,060 MEs. We will utilize Microenvironment    Microarrays (MEMA) to assess the effects of the ME on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation state, cell binding, and motility in each cell line. Statistical analysis will identify 50 significnt MEs for validation each year in years 2-6 in sub aim 1.2.A (total of 250 conditions). Each of the 50 ME conditions will be re-tested with the same endpoints at a second site using MEMA technology to provide independent validation of the primary results. At the same time, the cells will be tested using the 50 ME conditions on a second set of arrays designed to model the elastic modulus of human tissues to determine the effects on phenotypes of the matrix stiffness. From the 50 conditions tested in the validation aims, 30 of the most concordant between the primary and validation sites will be selected annually for analysis by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) aim 1.2.B and RNA expression analysis (aim I.2.C.). The RPPA aim will produce data using 500 validated antibodies against proteins and phosphoproteins in key signaling pathways under each of the ME perturbations. The RNA expression analysis will examine 1000 key genes using Luminex bead technology developed by the LINCS group at the Broad Institute, who will perform the same analysis for us using RNA prepared from each of the cell lines grown under the ME conditions. In total, the RPPA and RNA expression analysis will generate data for 150 different ME conditions under 2 different elastic moduli. All data will be carefully curated, with extensive metadata collected, and provided to the LINCS community for populating the data matrix.         Public Health Relevance: The main goals of the data generation aim will be to populate the LINCS data matrix with unique information that is currently not present in the matrix, and to provide data for generation of cellular network signatures.

"Understanding host-virus interactions at the single cell level ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbial world presents one of the largest challenges to modern medicine in the 21st century in the form of novel, untreatable pathogens. Bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria, are a major driver of this challenge. In particular, bacteriophages mediate the exchange of novel genetic materials (a process known as horizontal gene transfer, or HGT) between bacteria, transforming otherwise benign bacteria into human pathogens and driving the rapid emergence of pathogens resistant to existing treatments. Accordingly, there is a critical need to elucidate when, where, and how phage-mediated HGT occurs.  One critical aspect of phage-mediated HGT is lysogenization, the process by which phage DNA is integrated into the host bacterium's genome. Which bacterial cells are capable of being lysogenized and how the process of lysogenization is coupled to the physiology of the host bacterial cell are key questions in phage biology that remain unanswered. Recent technological advances in computer vision and single-cell imaging along with our lab's existing expertise in bacterial physiology enable us to interrogate this model system with unprecedented precision and find concrete answers to these long standing questions. We therefore propose to study these questions using E. coli and phage lambda as our initial model system.  Our guiding hypothesis is that the physiology of the host bacterial cells plays a critical role in the occurrence of lysogeny. Interrogating this problem of bacteria-phage interactions requires a systems level view of bacterial physiology and detailed dynamic measurements of lysogeny development. The goal of this proposal is to develop a system capable of measuring the activities of viral transcription factors, host proteins, and infection outcomes simultaneously in single cells. The analysis and interpretation of these data will lead to the discovery of novel host-virus interactions underlying lysogenic development and ultimately identify molecular targets that can be exploited to suppress phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacteriophages mediate horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the exchange of novel genetic materials between bacteria, transforming otherwise benign bacteria into human pathogens and driving the rapid emergence of pathogens resistant to existing treatments. Accordingly, there is a critical need to elucidate when, where, and how phage-mediated HGT occurs. Our proposal focuses on using novel technologies to answer these questions for bacteriophage lambda and its host, E. coli.        ",Understanding host-virus interactions at the single cell level,9377495,F32GM119319,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Physiology', 'Bacteriophage lambda', 'Bacteriophages', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Carbon', 'Cell Size', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cytolysis', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Lysogeny', 'Lytic', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Phosphorus', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plasmids', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Viral Physiology', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viral Regulatory Proteins', 'Virus', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'imaging Segmentation', 'live cell imaging', 'microbial', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'transcription factor', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,64787,0.026006172028383713
"Symmetry breaking and polarization of cell in 3D environments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanics, 3D structure, and biochemical composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) significantly influences diverse biological outcomes, including cellular polarization, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and proliferation For example, ECM alignment triggers polarized cell morphologies and facilitates migration away from the primary tumor. However, it remains poorly understood how cells spatiotemporally integrate 3D ECM cues in order to selectively orchestrate downstream signaling. The objective of the proposed research here aims to further our understanding this process. Specifically, I will investigate how mesenchymal cells spontaneously establish anteroposterior cell polarity in 3D ECM environments. Towards these means, I will evaluate the spatiotemporal evolution of cell-collagen interfaces, integrin activation, Rho family GTPase signaling, and cytoskeletal dynamics, in mesenchymal cells undergoing 3D polarization. I hypothesize that ECM fibers oriented normal to the cell surface will trigger integrin clustering and the formation of mature matrix adhesions (Aim 1). Furthermore, I hypothesize that Rho family GTPase activation will be bifurcated into focal adhesion-dependent and independent regimes (Aim 2), and that this will result in ECM context-dependent modulation of actin polymerization, bundling, dendritic branching, actomyosin contraction, and depolymerization (Aim 3).

"Niche signals in HSC genesis PROJECT SUMMARY Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have well established clinical applications in the treatment of heritable and acquired blood disorders. However, their therapeutic potential could be significantly broadened by engineering novel methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells or from directly reprogrammed adult cells. Toward this goal, we have established endothelial cell (EC) niche based culture methods that provide the necessary conditions to support the specification and self-renewal of HSC from embryonic hemogenic precursors, and more recently, from adult ECs using transcription factor (TF)-mediated conversion that bypasses a pluripotent intermediate. We hypothesize that recreating the signals necessary and sufficient to develop a clinically meaningful system for HSC generation in vitro will necessitate a comprehensive, systems approach to deconstruct the niche provided signals required for HSC specification and self-renewal. Thus, the overall goal of this grant is to leverage unique expertise of the collaborating laboratories to elucidate the signaling interactions regulating HSC specification and self-renewal from embryonic hemogenic precursors or TF-reprogrammed adult EC in the context of the EC niche. Our approach consists of three overlapping aims. The first aim will identify EC niche-provided signals necessary for embryonic HSC specification and self-renewal. The second aim will identify the unique HSC programs induced by these signals that regulate the transition from embryonic hemogenic precursor to bone fide repopulating HSC. The third will identify comparable programs that regulate the transition from adult EC to HSC during TF-mediated reprogramming in the EC niche. Key to these studies will be innovative functional assays, transcriptional profiling methods, and computational approaches that will enable us to resolve cellular complexity of niche cells and their interactions with developing embryonic or reprogrammed HSC at the single cell level. The role of identified signal factors in stage-specific support of HSC specification will be validated and further refined in vitro by gain and loss of function studies in the context of niche EC. Furthermore, to extend these studies to stromal cell-free systems as a step toward clinical translation, we will also test the contribution of identified signal factors in HSC specification and self-renewal in the context of stage-specific modulation of Notch activation using engineered Notch agonists. To achieve the goals of this proposal, we have developed a multidisciplinary collaboration involving unique expertise in each of our laboratories, including basic HSC and EC niche cell biology, direct TF based cellular conversion, clinical HSC transplantation, genome wide assessment of rare stem cell populations at single cell resolution, and innovative computational approaches to deconstruct core signal pathways regulating developmental transitions. Altogether, we expect the proposed studies will ultimately guide the design of novel strategies for deriving and expanding HSC in vitro for therapeutic applications. NARRATIVE Hematopoietic stem cells are currently used in the treatment and cure of a variety of blood disorders. Methods to generate new or greater numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in the laboratory could expand the availability and therapeutic applications of these valuable cells, but currently such methods are lacking. The goal of this proposal is to use lessons from endothelial cells, which provide critical signals to support hematopoietic stem cells, to engineer novel systems for the development and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in culture. !",Niche signals in HSC genesis,9380263,RC2DK114777,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Aorta', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Development', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gonadal structure', 'Grant', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mesonephric structure', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological Processes', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'base', 'blastomere structure', 'bone', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'receptor', 'self-renewal', 'stem', 'stem cell population', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,RC2,2017,683358,0.10102801569027012
"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease. Computational methods that can identify regulatory networks and their dynamics across related mammalian cell types offer a powerful approach to create better models of human disease and for regenerative medicine.",Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages,9353838,R01GM117339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Binding', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Distal', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signaling Protein', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Validation', 'cell fate specification', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'promoter', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,303220,0.0557937586473777
"Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction     CD4+ T cells provide numerous protective functions as part of the adaptive immune response, including cytokine-mediated and contact-mediated signals to B cells, CD8+ T cells, and innate- immune cells, as well as direct modes of attack on pathogenic agents. Nevertheless, their most critical roles in defense against intracellular bacterial pathogens are especially poorly understood. A major barrier to both study and vaccine design has been the lack of epitope- specific reagents for counting and tracking CD4+ T cells. We propose to develop a novel and well-validated algorithm for CD4+ T-cell epitope prediction that will enable progress in one of the most promising, yet presently hindered fields of immunology and vaccinology. CD4+ T-cell epitope dominance has been much less predictable than CD8+ T-cell epitope dominance because the class II MHC antigen-presenting protein is less selective and because proteolytic antigen processing has a major influence on the availability of peptide ligands. In the endocytic compartments, proteases act on mostly natively folded antigens, whose 3D structure directs proteolysis to the flexibly disordered segments. Thus, potential MHC-binding sequences in the flexible segments are destroyed, and sequences in the stable antigen segments are preferentially loaded and presented to CD4+ T cells. We will incorporate this bias toward epitope dominance in the stable antigen segments into a computational tool that significantly improves upon existing sequence-based methods for epitope prediction. We will develop our stability-based method using several possible supervised learning techniques, including hidden Markov models and position-specific scoring matrix methods. For soluble antigens, our feature set will be conformational stability data including crystallographic b-factor, surface-accessibility, COREX residue stabilities, and sequence entropy. In order to validate our method, we will use it to predict novel epitopes for 5 soluble secreted antigens from Salmonella typhimurium and Burkholderia pseudomallei, organisms for which CD4+ T-cell immunity is essential. Peptides corresponding to the 80th- percentile of predicted-epitopes will be tested for responses in individual C57BL/6 mice, following two types of exposure to the intact antigens, bacterial infection and subunit vaccination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CD4+ T cells constitute a major arm of the immune system, recognizing foreign antigens only when small pieces (epitopes) of the antigens are presented to them by other cells. Knowing what epitopes are going to be presented is key to understanding how the immune system works and may tell us how to design vaccines. Existing methods for predicting computational epitope prediction have not considered by the machinery that breaks the antigen into epitopes. We propose to use machine learning techniques to model how antigens are processed using experimental immune response data. The primary outcome of this project is an improved method for CD4+ T cell epitope prediction that can be combined with existing tools.",Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction,9241328,R21AI122199,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Burkholderia pseudomallei', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cells', 'Cloning', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II', 'Human Resources', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Reagent', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Salmonella typhimurium', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'antigen processing', 'arm', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'software development', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccinology']",NIAID,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2017,188125,0.07091929195930194
"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications.

"Discovery and characterization of novel ciliopathy protein complexes Abstract Ciliopathies are a collection of debilitating developmental disorders (e.g. Joubert syndrome, Meckel syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, orofaciodigital syndrome, polycystic kidney disease) which have no cures and limited but expensive treatments. Diagnosis and treatment is complicated due to ciliopathies causing multisystem pathologies and having large variance in their clinical presentations potentially resulting in neural tube defects, orofacial clefting, obesity, polycystic kidneys, retinal degeneration and in some cases, infant death. All ciliopathies are caused by dysfunctional cilia, the microtubule based organelle critical for cell-to-cell signaling, but currently there is limited understanding of the underlying molecular network responsible for proper cilia function. Recently, large-scale proteomic techniques have advanced where it is now possible to query the cell's molecular network and identify many new protein complexes. This proposal describes a research program that will 1) construct a ciliary complex map using proteomic techniques, 2) functionally characterize newly discovered ciliary complexes and 3) identify disruptions in complex assembly due to known ciliopathy mutations. Additional products of the proposed research will include a compendium of proteomic data on ciliated cells, statistical analysis tools for the discovery of protein complexes, functional characterization of critical ciliary processes and a more complete understanding of the underlying molecular network of ciliopathy disease states. This work aims to provide an important perspective of cilia biology in order to better understand the complex etiology and molecular causes of ciliopathies and potentially open new therapeutic avenues. Project Narrative Ciliopathies are a class of debilitating birth defects without known cures and limited but expensive treatments. Currently, we lack understanding of the underlying molecular network in ciliopathy patient cells and know even less about the causes of clinical presentations in ciliopathy patients.

Unfortunately, due to the shortage of available donor organs, or the patient's age, liver transplantation is not available to all patients. Hepatocyte transplantation (HTx) is an alternative, experimental treatment, with limited long term success in humans. A major unsolved question is how can we dynamically monitor and quantify cell transplantation in HTx to help improve HTx and to closely monitor clinical implementation?  To answer this question, we combine an innovative molecular and cellular MRI approach, with machine learning and computer vision, to non-invasively quantify cell engraftment and long term engraftment and repopulation (LTER) in the liver following HTx. Using a mouse model that facilitates LTER following HTx, we will use this combined approach to quantify transplanted cells in the liver at Days 1 and 7 after HTx, reflecting the timings of initial cell delivery (Day 1) and actual cellular engraftment in the tissue (Day 7). Then, we will measure LTER of these cells in the liver 30 - 90 days post-transplant, making innovative use of Eovist, an FDA approved MRI contrast agent specific for healthy hepatocytes. These experiments will evaluate mouse donor cells, as well as pig primary hepatocytes and pig embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocyte cell line.  This transformative work will be the first study to achieve this level of quantification wit molecular and cellular MRI of regenerative medicine, in any animal model. Additionally, we will test pattern recognition algorithms aimed at predicting the outcome of LTER, at an early stage. The capability to predict LTER outcome would be paradigm shifting as it would enable physicians to consider additional HTx regimens or second line treatments if HTx fails. This is seldom possible.  Though this project will be developed on mice, clinical translation of the imaging protocol would be straightforward because the exact imaging and data analysis scheme that we use to measure HTx in mouse, can be used to measure HTx in humans. Eovist is FDA approved for use in humans with liver disease, and MRI-based cell tracking of iron labeled cells is in clinical trials. Our preliminary data strongly suggests that MRI and data analysis can discriminate single cells at 200 µm resolution, meaning the MRI could likely be performed on any high field human MRI system. Additionally, the discovery that a stem cell-derived hepatocyte achieved even partial LTER would be extremely encouraging for exploring human and/or pig stem cell-derived hepatocytes for human use, because these cells can potentially alleviate the crucial issue of poor cell supply, similar to progress seen in pig islet transplant.  The proposed research takes a multidisciplinary approach with expertise in hepatocyte transplant and biology, molecular imaging, machine learning/computer vision, and mouse liver disease models. Collaboration among the researchers is ongoing with extensive preliminary data across all aspects of the proposed work. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of hepatocyte transplantation as an alternative to whole liver transplant requires non-invasive methodologies for monitoring the fate of transplanted cells. This project proposes new molecular and cellular MRI methods and analysis protocols to quantify hepatocyte transplantation and long term engraftment and repopulation.

"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis. In addition to developing physics-based models for diverse biological phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical important tools and algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) a new linear-algebra based algorithm for assessing the fidelity of directed differentiation and cellular reprogramming protocols and visualizing reprogramming/differentiation dynamics and (2) improved algorithms for inferring microbial interactions in the human microbiome from high-throughput sequence data. These computational tools will allow scientists to realize the immense therapeutic potential of cellular reprogramming and microbial ecology-based techniques for studying and treating human disease.

"Computational Classification of Human Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes is now relatively commonplace, and a heterogeneous mixture of electrophysiological phenotypes is generally obtained. The relative proportions of the 3 major phenotypes (nodal-like, atrial-like and ventricular-like) have been widely reported for various differentiation methods and cell lines, and is crucial information in determining their suitabilityfor any given application. However, such assessments are generally obtained by subjective evaluation, and in the few instances where quantitative measures have been used, classification was based on ad-hoc criteria using only a few parameters. To significantly improve the accuracy and reproducibility of the phenotypic analysis, we will utilize the entire action potential shape and employ advanced image analysis and machine learning methods in an automated computational algorithm. This algorithm will be used to classify the electrophysiological phenotypes of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) grown in culture, and optimized by using molecular identifiers.  The specific aims of the project are to: (1 obtain archetypal electrophysiological datasets of human ventricular, atrial and nodal cells, and (2) use image analysis and machine learning methods to classify hESC-CM phenotypes. To achieve these aims, we will use computational models of the 3 major subtypes of the heart as reference points for our classification algorithm, multi-site optical measurements of action potentials, molecular and pharmacological indicators of subtype, and metamorphosis distance as a quantitative measure of the dissimilarity between action potentials. In summary, this project will result in a standardized, objective and automated computational method to classify the relative amounts of the 3 major electrophysiological phenotypes in populations of hESC-CMs, as well as the development of an action potential ontology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Exciting progress has been made in the creation of human cardiomyocytes from stem cell sources, and they are known to develop into the major subtypes found in the heart. However, quantitative and automated measures of their relative proportions are lacking, and will be developed in this project using optical measurements and advanced computational algorithms. This information is vital in determining the suitability of the cells for any given application.",Computational Classification of Human Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes,8966039,R21HL122881,"['Action Potentials', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Metamorphosis', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Embryo', 'Engraftment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nodal', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Ventricular', 'base', 'cell type', 'drug testing', 'heart cell', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human stem cells', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'ion channel blocker', 'learning strategy', 'monolayer', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue repair']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,202500,0.03869677610340283
"High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is one of the most important tools for high-throughput single cell analysis. Fluorescent labeling acts as the primary approach for cellular analysis in flow cytometry. Nevertheless, fluorescent tags are not applicable to all cases especially small molecules (e.g. metabolites) for which labeling may significantly perturb their properties. Raman spectroscopic signals arising from inherent molecular vibrations provide a key approach to detect specific molecules inside cells and to differentiate cellular state. Raman-based microfluidic devices have been reported. However, the very small cross section of spontaneous Raman scattering results in low Raman signal level and consequently long data acquisition time, which is not compatible with the high- speed flow condition. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to establish a high-throughput high-content single cell analysis platform using molecular fingerprint vibrations as contrast. The specific objective of current application is to develop a vibrational spectroscopic cytometer based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process. Several recent advances in the Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) lab, including the highly sensitive femtosecond SRS imaging, lock-in free SRS signal detection and a tuned amplifier array for multiplex SRS imaging, pave the foundation for the planned instrumentation. The PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team for the proposed study. Dr. J. Paul Robinson (co-PI) is a leader in development and applications of fluorescence-based flow cytometer and he will bring expertise to the design of fluidics and multichannel detection systems. Dr. Bartek Rajwa (co-PI) will provide expertise for spectroscopic cytometry data analysis and machine learning. The team will design and construct a SRS flow cytometer by multichannel detection of dispersed SRS signal (Aim 1), construct a tandem system able to collect SRS and fluorescence data (Aim 2), develop spectral un-mixing and machine-learning analysis tools able to combine the information obtained from SRS spectra and labeled biomarkers for functional classification of cells (Aim 3), and validate the capability of SRS flow cytometer for label-free detection of single-cell metabolism (Aim 4). With a speed of analyzing thousands of cells per second, SRS flow cytometer will enable high-throughput analysis of single-cell chemical content which is beyond the reach by fluorescence-based flow cytometer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build a high-throughput single cell analysis platform through multiplex stimulated Raman scattering detection of single flowing cells at microsecond time scale. Having fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering detection in tandem, our platform is capable of discovering new metabolic signatures of cell subpopulations (e.g. cancer stem cells sorted through fluorescent markers). Such discovery could potentially lead to new development of disease-specific treatment strategies.        ",High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry,9080637,R01GM118471,"['Amplifiers', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Energy Transfer', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nanostructures', 'Optics', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quartz', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tube', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'cancer stem cell', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'design and construction', 'detector', 'electric impedance', 'high throughput analysis', 'instrumentation', 'light scattering', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'photomultiplier', 'public health relevance', 'single cell analysis', 'small molecule', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'vibration']",NIGMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,428677,0.06763618688140195
"Computational Modeling of Heterogeneous Gene Expression in Single Cells ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent development of single cell RNA-seq protocols enabled genomewide investigation of organismal systems at the cellular level, opening many new biological questions for study. Single cell resolution allows characterization of rare or unknown cell types, enables dissection of differentiation processes, and aids in decoding regulatory networks responsible for healthy and diseased states of cells. However, current single cell RNA-seq studies are limited by crucial gaps in existing computational methods.  We have devised strategies to address three key limitations of current single cell RNA-seq analysis methods: (1) lack of models for isoform-specific expression, (2) inability to link gene expression differences with measurable changes in cell function, and (3) lack of methods for studying sequential progression of gene expression changes. To address the first shortcoming, we developed SingleSplice, an algorithm for identifying genes whose isoform ratios vary more than expected by chance across a set of single cells (Aim 1). We have also developed a novel microraft platform that allows culturing, functional characterization, isolation, and subsequent sequencing of single cells. Using data generated from this platform, we will perform supervised machine learning to identify genes linked to functional differences among cells (Aim 2). To address the third limitation, we will use locally linear embedding, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, to identify ""trajectories"" of cells proceeding through sequential processes such as development and response to stimuli (Aim 3). We will apply our methods to our own data generated from microraft experiments, as well as publicly available single cell RNA-seq data from developing lung tissue and immune cells responding to immune stimulation.  Using data from experiments in which spike-in transcripts are added at constant, known amounts to cells to mimic an alternative splicing change, we found that SingleSplice detects isoform switching with high sensitivity (73%) and specificity (93%). We used microrafts to sequence single cells from a pancreatic cancer cell line and found that this approach produced high-quality data comparable to that from the Fluidigm C1. The microraft technology also enabled us to sequence RNA from pancreatic cancer cells after gemcitabine treatment and measure the proliferation of the cells, identifying both ""drug resistant"" cells that divide and cels that do not proliferate, giving a dataset with matched functional and transcriptomic measurements. Preliminary investigation of a dataset in which dendritic cells were stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shows that locally linear embedding (LLE) can order cells according to the length of time they have been exposed to LPS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Until very recently, studies have relied on aggregate measurements taken from bulk samples of cells, but in many important health-related applications, the information lost by lumping together thousands of cells poses a real barrier to understanding. Neurological conditions, cancer, and stem cell therapies are among the many areas that call for single cell RNA-seq methods. We propose to develop broadly applicable computational methods that will eliminate key limitations of current analyses and enable groundbreaking research in many domains important for public health.            ",Computational Modeling of Heterogeneous Gene Expression in Single Cells,9051866,F31HG008912,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Drug resistance', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Glean', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Pancreas', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'gemcitabine', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'pancreatic cancer cells', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'stem cell therapy', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2016,33259,0.09864480766952965

"Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on “manual gating” of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 – Implement a novel computational infrastructure – FlowGate – for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 – Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 – Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 – Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community. Project Narrative Flow cytometry analysis is widely used for single cell phenotyping in the translational research lab to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes and in the clinical diagnostic lab for the identification and classification of blood-borne malignancies. However, the current practice for cytometry data analysis using “manual gating” based on two-dimensional data plots is subjective, labor-intensive and unreliable, especially when using more complex high content staining panels. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly computational infrastructure for cytometry data analysis for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective, accurate, and reproducible analysis of cytometry data.",Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics,9215166,U01TR001801,"['Abnormal Cell', 'Acute leukemia', 'Adoption', 'Antiviral Therapy', 'Apoptosis', 'Asthma', 'Autoimmunity', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Leukocyte Chemotaxis', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translational Research', 'Visual', 'base', 'computer infrastructure', 'cyber infrastructure', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'monocyte', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outreach', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'research study', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational study', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCATS,"J.

"New Integrative Pathway Analysis Methods to Predict Biomedical Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to reveal the key regulators that determine the usually ordered development of an animal from undifferentiated pluripotent cells to specialized cells that carry out all of the functions in our body. The coordinated expression of the genome underlies these processes and is orchestrated by networks of interacting genes that we are only beginning to unveil. Cell circuitry is complex but the discovery of the Yamanaka factors demonstrates that even less than a handful of transcription factors can exert profound changes on cell and tissue fates. Thus, the combinations of genes needed to unlock cell determinants seem tantalizingly parsimonious. Large-scale projects are underway to catalog the genomic, epigenomic, and functional genomic landscapes of many different cells in multiple different organisms. As high- throughput techniques such as DNA and RNA sequencing mature, there is an increase in demand for integrative approaches to elucidate the rules underlying intrinsic, adaptive, and programmed phenotypic changes that cells undergo that can be inferred from such data. Our starting point will be to extend the pathway integrative framework developed over the past several years for the interpretation of cancer genomics datasets for the Cancer Genome Atlas project. Extensions to the input pathways used, and advances in the model to enrich the formal representation, will be developed so that a breadth of datasets in human and model organisms can be analyzed. The approach will culminate in the combining of machine-learning classification with probabilistic graphical models. The classifiers will identify predictive pathway features for cell state distinctions in a large database. Genetic manipulations among these features can then be proposed, in any combination, as formal interventions on the graphical model of the resulting classifiers, a major advantage of this work. The pathway models will be applied to the prediction of factors that can confer differentiation and de-differentiation queues to human cortical neurons. Computationally predicted gene perturbations in this system will be tested in living cells. Identifying critical modulators of the cell fate decisions underlying the conversion of stem cells to neural progenitors to mature neural cell types will advance our understanding of neural development. These same regulators may also play an important role in glioma, a disease where the tumor cells appear to be in a neural progenitor-like state. Taken together, the proposed theoretical and applied informatics approaches will contribute powerful tools for interpreting and predicting both routine and aberrant cellular responses. Researchers will be able to query the complex networks with computer algorithms as high fidelity surrogates. In the not so distant future, our hope is to advance our understanding of normal differentiation and shed light on how the regulation of these programs breaks down in disease processes like cancer, shedding light on diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to extend machine-learning and probabilistic graphical modeling approaches developed in the field of cancer genomics to the analysis of a broad range of human and model organism datasets. Novel methods for proposing genetic perturbations using a formal computational analysis will be developed and tested for their ability to suggest pluripotent and lineage-committing factors in a neural progenitor differentiation assay. The methods developed will contribute significant theoretical advances as well as reveal common mechanisms of stem cells and tumor biology to shed light on new treatment options for cancer.",New Integrative Pathway Analysis Methods to Predict Biomedical Outcomes,9097769,R01GM109031,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Embryo', 'Equilibrium', 'Future', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Biology', 'Undifferentiated', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell type', 'daughter cell', 'developmental disease', 'drug sensitivity', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic manipulation', 'human stem cells', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'neoplastic cell', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stemness', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R01,2016,585416,0.05641903225879954
"Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases of aging account for a significant proportion of healthcare spending and result in a painful and limiting existence for many tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of people around the world. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that re-purposes known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content fluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced in human cells in which diseases and treatments have been modeled. This system has been adapted to screen for drugs which may preferentially destroy senescent cells, as this may result in improved tissue function and decreases in pathology and mortality related to aging. In this SBIR fast-track proposal we will:  PHASE I Identify a morphological profile of senescence in a variety of human cell types. Progression to Phase II will depend on our ability to demonstrate the power of our morphological approach to identify senescent cells independent of any known senescent markers.  PHASE II Identify known drugs which preferentially destroy senescent cells, without affecting healthy cells, as identified by morphometric means.  Evaluate the efficacy of identified senolytic agents in a variety of tissue function and health-span models in mice. *Evaluate the effect of identified senolytic agents in a murine model of age-associated cardiovascular disease. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I/Phase II Fast-track SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds we identify as a result. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic diseases of aging affect a significant proportion of Americans. Cellular senescence, a useful biological program which prevents replication of cells exposed to various stresses that may be at risk of initiating tumors, has long-term deleterious inflammatory effects. We will combine biological, imaging, and computational approaches to identify complex morphological profiles associated with senescence, to identify senescence- killing effects of known drugs, and to evaluate any hits in relevant models of aging.",Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction,9141082,R44AG053131,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'CDKN2A gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Aging', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Stress', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cytokine Activation', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Excision', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Length', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organ', 'Oxidants', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Telomere Shortening', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Tumor Suppression', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'beta-Galactosidase', 'cell type', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'senescence', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NIA,"RECURSION PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC",R44,2016,223006,0.02238304874253472
"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease networks are complex interactions between multiple proteins. Precise understanding of the multifactorial perturbations imposed on multi-component networks is a crucial step in the development of a rational approach to drug discovery and personalization of therapy.

"Symmetry breaking and polarization of cell in 3D environments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanics, 3D structure, and biochemical composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) significantly influences diverse biological outcomes, including cellular polarization, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and proliferation For example, ECM alignment triggers polarized cell morphologies and facilitates migration away from the primary tumor. However, it remains poorly understood how cells spatiotemporally integrate 3D ECM cues in order to selectively orchestrate downstream signaling. The objective of the proposed research here aims to further our understanding this process. Specifically, I will investigate how mesenchymal cells spontaneously establish anteroposterior cell polarity in 3D ECM environments. Towards these means, I will evaluate the spatiotemporal evolution of cell-collagen interfaces, integrin activation, Rho family GTPase signaling, and cytoskeletal dynamics, in mesenchymal cells undergoing 3D polarization. I hypothesize that ECM fibers oriented normal to the cell surface will trigger integrin clustering and the formation of mature matrix adhesions (Aim 1). Furthermore, I hypothesize that Rho family GTPase activation will be bifurcated into focal adhesion-dependent and independent regimes (Aim 2), and that this will result in ECM context-dependent modulation of actin polymerization, bundling, dendritic branching, actomyosin contraction, and depolymerization (Aim 3). This will be accomplished by light- sheet imaging of mesenchymal cells embedded within reconstituted ECM-like environments, acute pharmacological perturbations, and computer vision analysis of ECM fiber orientation, cell shape, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal dynamics. This research will serve as the foundation from which further studies can evaluate 3D spatiotemporal cell signaling in physiological and pathophysiological ECM states.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The extracellular matrix (ECM) profoundly affects cellular processes in both health and disease. For example, ECM rigidity has been shown to trigger cell differentiation, and aligned ECM structures facilitate cell migration away from primary tumor sites. However, the ECM is mechanically, chemically, and structurally complex. As such, it remains poorly understood how cells sense and selectively respond to ECM characteristics in order to achieve biologically and clinically significant responses. The objective of the proposed research aims to investigate cell-ECM contacts and downstream cell signaling as mesenchymal cells adopt anteroposterior cell morphologies in physiologically relevant 3D ECM microenvironments. This research will broaden our understanding of 3D cellular signal transduction and serve as a foundation for future studies that address cell-ECM interactions in physiological and pathophysiological states.        ",Symmetry breaking and polarization of cell in 3D environments,9049973,F32GM117793,"['Actins', 'Actomyosin', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anisotropy', 'Apoptosis', 'Architecture', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biosensor', 'Bundling', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Fiber', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'F-Actin', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Focal Adhesions', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Integrins', 'Light', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Microfilaments', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Radial', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'cell motility', 'clinically significant', 'depolymerization', 'extracellular', 'insight', 'live cell imaging', 'migration', 'novel', 'polarized cell', 'polymerization', 'public health relevance', 'reconstitution', 'response', 'rho', 'single molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIGMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F32,2016,58818,0.10774980030280307
"Single-cell multi-protein device for informative cellular function evaluation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ELISpot including its variant FLUOROSpot remains the mainstay to measure true secretion of single cells and to assess cellular function (e.g., immunity) in the pre-clinical and clinical settings. However, because it measures only one or two proteins per single cell and provides minimal biological information, it has limited utility for measuring cell biology and physiological functions at the systems level. Because a subset of the cells capable of producing multiple cytokines (up to 40), called polyfunctional cells, dominate the overall response but currently no commercial tools are available to quantify polyfunctional cells at the highly multiplexed level, representing a major barrier in both academic research and pharmaceutical industry to accurately quantify cellular immune responses. Thus, it is necessary to develop a technology that can measure an array of proteins from single cells, and will help address a host of important biological and biomedical questions ranging from immune cell function heterogeneity, stem cell differentiation, drug resistance, angiogenesis, to cell-cell communication networks. Also, this technology is of urgent need in biotech and pharmaceutical industry. To address these challenges, this technology needs to meet all three of the following requirements: (i) Single cell sensitivity, (ii) High multiplicity, and (iii) High content. IsoPlexi has a prototype hand-held technology that for the first time provides the ability to measure many (up to 42) secreted effector proteins at the single T-cell level. At the same time, this device in its envisioned form will be far less costly than existing single-cell instruments, representing a significant market advantage for wide-spread use in pre-clinical and clinical uses. When applied to, but not limited in, the immunotherapeutics space, our technology has the capability to (1) detect the broadest mechanism of action at the single immune cell level, and (2) quantify the effector function of activated T-cell response including polyfunctionality at a broad cellular leve to detect both effective response and potential toxicity (autoimmunity). With Phase 1 support, IsoPlexis plans to conduct the initial industrial R&D to turn this academic technology to a commercial product. We propose to: (1) develop a fully packaged single-cell protein secretion assay device to meet minimum commercial usability and validity standards; (2) develop computational pipelines and a software suite for automated data quantification and informatics. We expect to develop a user-friendly hardware and a software suite for reliable single cell multiplex protein secretion profiling and rapid data analysis. This technology can not only provide comprehensive single cell information to address the biological and biomedical questions in academic research, but also offers a solution for biotech and pharmaceutical industry to evaluate drug/treatment responses at the single cell level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to conduct the initial industrial R&D to turn our current academic single cell multiplex secretion profiling technology to a commercial product.

"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease. Computational methods that can identify regulatory networks and their dynamics across related mammalian cell types offer a powerful approach to create better models of human disease and for regenerative medicine.",Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages,9177501,R01GM117339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signaling Protein', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'cell fate specification', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'promoter', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,288612,0.0557937586473777
"Morphomic analysis of a simple chordate DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed collaborative project will investigate fundamental processes driving chordate embryogenesis. The project will combine the skills and expertise of two research groups: one that works in the area of developmental biology, and the other in the area of image analysis and computer vision. The goal of the project is take a whole-embryo embryo approach to investigating morphogenesis in live embryos in all 4 dimensions (x,y, z and t). Specifically, we will collect and analyze confocal microscopy images to derive quantitative data on the division, shape, volume and movements of all cells in both selected developing organs and in whole embryos. This project presents many challenges in sample selection and labeling, image capture, and image analysis and visualization. Most model organisms are fundamentally unsuited to the challenge of capturing the shape and movement of every cell in an entire tissue. Those that are suitable typically are distantly related to the chordates, and thus lack organs and tissues relevant to human health and disease. The ascidians (sea squirts), however, are close relatives of the vertebrates that combine a chordate body plan with a small and simple embryonic architecture suitable for imaging in toto. The data to be collected in such observations, particularly at the high resolution needed to observe cellular behavior, will be enormous. The extraction of large-scale quantitative information from timelapse image sets poses substantial challenges in terms of image segmentation and analysis. We have already made significant progress in segmenting 3D ascidian images and further refinements of these approaches are proposed here. The segmented data will allow the quantitative analysis of many complex cell behaviors, including the fundamental changes in cell shape and motility driving gastrulation, neurulation and convergent extension. These analyses will lead to specific hypotheses regarding the cellular and molecular machinery driving morphogenesis. To further investigate the molecular basis for these cellular phenomena, we will also extend our imaging and analysis efforts to investigate the dynamic patterns of subcellular localization of several proteins with key roles in morphogenesis. Organs and tissues are built during embryogenesis through the precise interactions of a myriad of cells and cell types. Advances in tissue repair and engineering will require that the rules and mechanisms that govern how cells come together to form organs and tissues be elucidated. The project proposed here will combine the efforts of developmental biologists and computer engineers to capture and analyze images from live embryos with the goal of understanding cell behaviors in forming organs.",Morphomic analysis of a simple chordate,9094655,R01HD059217,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Actins', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Organ', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell division', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroporation', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Movement', 'Myosin Light Chains', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nuclear', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Plasmids', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Seeds', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'System', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'ascidian', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blastomere structure', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'convergent extension', 'developmental genetics', 'gastrulation', 'image visualization', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging informatics', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'moesin', 'professor', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein distribution', 'segmentation Image analysis', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue repair']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2016,322717,0.028258065774979725
"Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction     CD4+ T cells provide numerous protective functions as part of the adaptive immune response, including cytokine-mediated and contact-mediated signals to B cells, CD8+ T cells, and innate- immune cells, as well as direct modes of attack on pathogenic agents. Nevertheless, their most critical roles in defense against intracellular bacterial pathogens are especially poorly understood. A major barrier to both study and vaccine design has been the lack of epitope- specific reagents for counting and tracking CD4+ T cells. We propose to develop a novel and well-validated algorithm for CD4+ T-cell epitope prediction that will enable progress in one of the most promising, yet presently hindered fields of immunology and vaccinology. CD4+ T-cell epitope dominance has been much less predictable than CD8+ T-cell epitope dominance because the class II MHC antigen-presenting protein is less selective and because proteolytic antigen processing has a major influence on the availability of peptide ligands. In the endocytic compartments, proteases act on mostly natively folded antigens, whose 3D structure directs proteolysis to the flexibly disordered segments. Thus, potential MHC-binding sequences in the flexible segments are destroyed, and sequences in the stable antigen segments are preferentially loaded and presented to CD4+ T cells. We will incorporate this bias toward epitope dominance in the stable antigen segments into a computational tool that significantly improves upon existing sequence-based methods for epitope prediction. We will develop our stability-based method using several possible supervised learning techniques, including hidden Markov models and position-specific scoring matrix methods. For soluble antigens, our feature set will be conformational stability data including crystallographic b-factor, surface-accessibility, COREX residue stabilities, and sequence entropy. In order to validate our method, we will use it to predict novel epitopes for 5 soluble secreted antigens from Salmonella typhimurium and Burkholderia pseudomallei, organisms for which CD4+ T-cell immunity is essential. Peptides corresponding to the 80th- percentile of predicted-epitopes will be tested for responses in individual C57BL/6 mice, following two types of exposure to the intact antigens, bacterial infection and subunit vaccination.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CD4+ T cells constitute a major arm of the immune system, recognizing foreign antigens only when small pieces (epitopes) of the antigens are presented to them by other cells. Knowing what epitopes are going to be presented is key to understanding how the immune system works and may tell us how to design vaccines. Existing methods for predicting computational epitope prediction have not considered by the machinery that breaks the antigen into epitopes. We propose to use machine learning techniques to model how antigens are processed using experimental immune response data. The primary outcome of this project is an improved method for CD4+ T cell epitope prediction that can be combined with existing tools.                ",Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction,9019992,R21AI122199,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Burkholderia pseudomallei', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II', 'Human Resources', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organism', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Reagent', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Salmonella typhimurium', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'antigen processing', 'arm', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'expression cloning', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'software development', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccinology']",NIAID,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2016,225750,0.07091929195930194
"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells.

"Defining cell types, lineage, and connectivity in developing human fetal cortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Little is currently known about the number, proportion, or lineage of distinct cell types in the developing human fetal brain. Knowledge of such a component list and its functional genomic foundations is crucial for understanding the function of this complex system, its evolution, and how it is disrupted in disease. We hypothesize that comprehensive single-cell mRNA expression profiles provide an accurate and efficient rubric for a first generation classification schema that can be integrated with lineage, morphology and connectivity. We will use unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster 10,000 single cell transcriptomes derived from RNAseq of the human fetal cortical anlage, providing an unbiased model to identify and understand the resultant cell classes. We will validate these cell class determinations using in situ hybridization. We will use marker genes identified in this analysis to perform lineage tracing using cell-type specific reporters engineered via genome editing, and obtain single cell transcriptional profiles at different stages of development to determine lineage relationships. Finally, we will analyze intact fetal cerebral hemispheres and mouse-human chimeras processed with the CLARITY technique to provide 3D localization and morphology of a subset of cell types. To markedly improve scalability of this approach, we will apply enhanced Bessel Beam Tomography for spectral image acquisition, increasing imaging speed by 2-3 orders of magnitude while maintaining high resolution. In parallel, we will develop automated image analysis algorithms to enable cell detection and comprehensive morphological assessment in an automated and correctable fashion. Overall, completion of these studies will permit, among many future advances: (1) The generation of an unbiased rubric of cell class based on integration of morphological, transcriptomic, and connectivity data used to understand cell type diversity and function; (2) Connection of cellular function, morphology, and connectivity to specific genes and proteins; (3) Refinement of the cellular basis of transcriptomic disease signatures and understanding of the individual cellular mechanisms of disease (4) The construction of connectivity diagrams based on discovered circuit components allowing development of realistic computational models of brain function and dysfunction; (5) Optimization of cell types generated by in vitro stem cell models based on gold standard in vivo cell class definition; and (6) Advancement of light microscopy techniques for rapid, spectral high resolution imaging of postmortem human and mouse brain including automated processing, which in addition to permitting high throughput brain mapping, will significantly advance mechanistic studies in mouse models and pathological studies in human. Completion of these aims will provide a proof of principle, multiple tools, and a core framework on which to build a more comprehensive knowledge of cell classes in the human brain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing evidence implicates abnormalities in the development and architecture of the human cerebral cortex in neuropsychiatric illnesses such as autism and schizophrenia. Understanding the pathological disruption of a complex system such as the human cortex first requires an understanding of its components: individual cells. We will develop novel methods and tools to identify the individual cell classes that compose the human fetal cortex, determine the lineage of progenitor cell classes, and map the location, morphology, and connectivity of each cell class.","Defining cell types, lineage, and connectivity in developing human fetal cortex",9128726,U01MH105991,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Categories', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebral hemisphere', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Chimera organism', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stem cells', 'Surface', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'density', 'fetal', 'frontal lobe', 'functional genomics', 'genome editing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning network', 'light microscopy', 'mRNA Expression', 'method development', 'molecular phenotype', 'mouse model', 'neocortical', 'nerve stem cell', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'population based', 'progenitor', 'rapid technique', 'sound', 'spectrograph', 'statistics', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2016,361307,0.11395196816711228
"Bleb Functions in 3D Morphogenesis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell migration is one of the most basic physiological processes. Even though the physical environment has been shown to regulate cell migration, most research has focused on cells migrating on rigid, 2D surfaces. In nature, cells migrate in 3D environments where they must constantly negotiate the balance between cellular and extracellular forces and between cellular and extracellular volumes. A striking feature of 3D migration is the frequent occurrence of blebs, which are hemispherical protrusions devoid of actin. The roles of these blebs have been little investigated. In particular it is still unknown ho, or even if, blebs directly enable motility by exerting forces on their environment. We hypothesize that blebs promote 3D motility under conditions in which pseudopodial extensions, which lead migration in 2D, mechanically stall and thus fail to allow directed migration. To test this hypothesis, we will develop computational tools to characterize 3D cell morphology in an unbiased manner, and to find, track, and classify protrusive structures such as blebs. To distinguish protrusive types, we will also develop tools to measure the localization of cortex-associated proteins. Since the collagen matrix plays an active and integral role in 3D cell migration, we will further develop tools to extract the locations and properties of the individual collagen fibrils that compose the collagen matrix. Migration results from the mechanical interaction of cells with their environment. We will therefore track how blebs and other protrusive structures interact with and deform individual collagen fibrils, and we will measure the localization of proteins at bleb-fibril interfaces. We additionally hypothesize that blebs play different functions in different mechanical environments. We will test this hypothesis by searching for mechanical environments in which blebs transition between functional states. In particular, we will begin to analyze plasticity between modes of blebbing motility by testing the hypothesis that, as collagen stiffness is increased, blebbing gradually transitions from pushing fibrils away to interdigitating pores, and thus both functional bleb types can coexist in the same cell. Together, this work will refocus migration research on a model centered on cell-environment interactions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cell migration is key to processes as diverse as embryogenesis, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. In nature and within our own bodies, cells migrate in varied and complicated 3D environments, yet most cell migration research has focused on cells migrating on flat surfaces. We propose to develop computational tools to analyze 3D images of migrating cells and use these tools to study the physical basis of 3D cell migration.            ",Bleb Functions in 3D Morphogenesis,9146167,F32GM116370,"['Actins', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Biological Models', 'Bulla', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cellular biology', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Fibril', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dissociation', 'Embryonic Development', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Filopodia', 'Focal Adhesions', 'Geometry', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immigration', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Physical environment', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Price', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Veins', 'Work', 'Wound Healing', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cell motility', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'microscopic imaging', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular imaging', 'polymerization', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F32,2016,60702,0.08292219742871965
"Quantitative molecular and cellular MRI of hepatocyte transplantation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  For many severe liver diseases, the only effective treatment is liver transplantation. Unfortunately, due to the shortage of available donor organs, or the patient's age, liver transplantation is not available to all patients. Hepatocyte transplantation (HTx) is an alternative, experimental treatment, with limited long term success in humans. A major unsolved question is how can we dynamically monitor and quantify cell transplantation in HTx to help improve HTx and to closely monitor clinical implementation?  To answer this question, we combine an innovative molecular and cellular MRI approach, with machine learning and computer vision, to non-invasively quantify cell engraftment and long term engraftment and repopulation (LTER) in the liver following HTx. Using a mouse model that facilitates LTER following HTx, we will use this combined approach to quantify transplanted cells in the liver at Days 1 and 7 after HTx, reflecting the timings of initial cell delivery (Day 1) and actual cellular engraftment in the tissue (Day 7). Then, we will measure LTER of these cells in the liver 30 - 90 days post-transplant, making innovative use of Eovist, an FDA approved MRI contrast agent specific for healthy hepatocytes. These experiments will evaluate mouse donor cells, as well as pig primary hepatocytes and pig embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocyte cell line.  This transformative work will be the first study to achieve this level of quantification wit molecular and cellular MRI of regenerative medicine, in any animal model. Additionally, we will test pattern recognition algorithms aimed at predicting the outcome of LTER, at an early stage. The capability to predict LTER outcome would be paradigm shifting as it would enable physicians to consider additional HTx regimens or second line treatments if HTx fails. This is seldom possible.  Though this project will be developed on mice, clinical translation of the imaging protocol would be straightforward because the exact imaging and data analysis scheme that we use to measure HTx in mouse, can be used to measure HTx in humans. Eovist is FDA approved for use in humans with liver disease, and MRI-based cell tracking of iron labeled cells is in clinical trials. Our preliminary data strongly suggests that MRI and data analysis can discriminate single cells at 200 µm resolution, meaning the MRI could likely be performed on any high field human MRI system. Additionally, the discovery that a stem cell-derived hepatocyte achieved even partial LTER would be extremely encouraging for exploring human and/or pig stem cell-derived hepatocytes for human use, because these cells can potentially alleviate the crucial issue of poor cell supply, similar to progress seen in pig islet transplant.  The proposed research takes a multidisciplinary approach with expertise in hepatocyte transplant and biology, molecular imaging, machine learning/computer vision, and mouse liver disease models. Collaboration among the researchers is ongoing with extensive preliminary data across all aspects of the proposed work.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of hepatocyte transplantation as an alternative to whole liver transplant requires non-invasive methodologies for monitoring the fate of transplanted cells. This project proposes new molecular and cellular MRI methods and analysis protocols to quantify hepatocyte transplantation and long term engraftment and repopulation. Successful completion of this project opens up the near term possibility for clinical utility.            ",Quantitative molecular and cellular MRI of hepatocyte transplantation,9006872,R01DK107697,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Cell Transplants', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Engraftment', 'FDA approved', 'Family suidae', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Germ Cells', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hepatocyte transplantation', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Label', 'Liver', 'Liver Failure', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Organ Donor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physicians', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Weight', 'Wit', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'embryonic stem cell', 'hepatocyte engraftment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'islet', 'liver transplantation', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'pre-clinical research', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'success', 'tool', 'uptake']",NIDDK,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,489308,0.06975372471688907
"Machine learning methods to impute and annotate epigenomic maps DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Program has produced reference epigenomic maps derived from a variety of human primary cells and tissues, including pluripotent cell types and in vitro differentiated forms, highly purified primar cells, and a range of fetal and adult tissues. The goal of the proposed project is to develop, validate and apply unsupervised machine learning methods to the joint analysis of these epigenomic maps along with (1) data generated by the NIH ENCODE Consortium, (2) a variety of publicly available data sets that characterize the three-dimensional structure of DNA in the nucleus, and (3) information about evolutionary conservation, represented by cross-species DNA alignments. The first aim of the project will use data imputation methods to carry out virtual functional genomics experiments. The proposed method is based on techniques developed in the context of recommender systems, but is extended to model dependencies along the genomic axis. By simultaneously analyzing the pattern of biochemical activity across a range of cell types and assay types, the proposed imputation method will accurately predict the results of an assay, such as ChIP-seq for a particular histone modification in a particular cell type, that has not yet been carried out. We will systematically apply this method to Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE data, filling in missing experiments in the matrix of cell types and assay types. The remaining three specific aims extend and apply our existing system for semi-automated genome annotation, Segway, which integrates a wide variety of functional genomics data into a human interpretable labeling of genomic elements. These analyses will be performed on real data as well as the virtual experiments from Aim 1. We propose a novel, graph-based regularization scheme and show how, using this approach, we can use Segway to perform integrated analysis of data across cell types and integrate 3D genome architecture information from assays such as Hi-C. We also propose a post-processing method to exploit patterns of evolutionary conservation to identify functionally important labels in the resulting annotations. The primary deliverables will include novel software for imputation and annotation, as well as publicly available sets of virtual experiments and genome annotations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH has recently expended substantial effort to generate raw data that characterizes the human epigenome across a variety of cell types. This proposal uses machine learning methods to help make sense of this large collection of epigenomic maps, combining the maps with data generated by the NIH ENCODE Consortium, information about the 3D structure of DNA, and information about evolutionary conservation. The project will produce novel computational methods as well as two primary analysis products: virtual experiments for combinations of assays and cell types that have not yet been carried out and annotations that identify various types of biochemical and functional activity along the human genome.",Machine learning methods to impute and annotate epigenomic maps,8925082,R01ES024917,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virtual Library', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer based statistical methods', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'functional genomics', 'genome annotation', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'markov model', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virtual']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,282942,0.04380911138077135
"Computational Classification of Human Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes is now relatively commonplace, and a heterogeneous mixture of electrophysiological phenotypes is generally obtained. The relative proportions of the 3 major phenotypes (nodal-like, atrial-like and ventricular-like) have been widely reported for various differentiation methods and cell lines, and is crucial information in determining their suitabilityfor any given application. However, such assessments are generally obtained by subjective evaluation, and in the few instances where quantitative measures have been used, classification was based on ad-hoc criteria using only a few parameters. To significantly improve the accuracy and reproducibility of the phenotypic analysis, we will utilize the entire action potential shape and employ advanced image analysis and machine learning methods in an automated computational algorithm. This algorithm will be used to classify the electrophysiological phenotypes of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) grown in culture, and optimized by using molecular identifiers.  The specific aims of the project are to: (1 obtain archetypal electrophysiological datasets of human ventricular, atrial and nodal cells, and (2) use image analysis and machine learning methods to classify hESC-CM phenotypes. To achieve these aims, we will use computational models of the 3 major subtypes of the heart as reference points for our classification algorithm, multi-site optical measurements of action potentials, molecular and pharmacological indicators of subtype, and metamorphosis distance as a quantitative measure of the dissimilarity between action potentials. In summary, this project will result in a standardized, objective and automated computational method to classify the relative amounts of the 3 major electrophysiological phenotypes in populations of hESC-CMs, as well as the development of an action potential ontology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Exciting progress has been made in the creation of human cardiomyocytes from stem cell sources, and they are known to develop into the major subtypes found in the heart. However, quantitative and automated measures of their relative proportions are lacking, and will be developed in this project using optical measurements and advanced computational algorithms. This information is vital in determining the suitability of the cells for any given application.            ",Computational Classification of Human Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes,8824780,R21HL122881,"['Action Potentials', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Metamorphosis', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Embryo', 'Engraftment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nodal', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Ventricular', 'base', 'cell type', 'drug testing', 'heart cell', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human stem cells', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'ion channel blocker', 'monolayer', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue repair']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,243000,0.03869677610340283
"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular signatures of human neurons we identify can be used to provide insights into the molecular factors that distinguish central neurons from healthy people from those of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, SMA, PD and HD. These insights will provide molecular targets that can be used to develop new drugs to block the progression of these diseases which are presently untreatable.            ",Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells,8929322,U54NS091046,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Network-based', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Online Systems', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Scourge', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'disease-causing mutation', 'epigenomics', 'genome sequencing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'molecular phenotype', 'outreach program', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'statistics', 'stem cell technology', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,U54,2015,334000,0.08821222879734916
"New Integrative Pathway Analysis Methods to Predict Biomedical Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to reveal the key regulators that determine the usually ordered development of an animal from undifferentiated pluripotent cells to specialized cells that carry out all of the functions in our body. The coordinated expression of the genome underlies these processes and is orchestrated by networks of interacting genes that we are only beginning to unveil. Cell circuitry is complex but the discovery of the Yamanaka factors demonstrates that even less than a handful of transcription factors can exert profound changes on cell and tissue fates. Thus, the combinations of genes needed to unlock cell determinants seem tantalizingly parsimonious. Large-scale projects are underway to catalog the genomic, epigenomic, and functional genomic landscapes of many different cells in multiple different organisms. As high- throughput techniques such as DNA and RNA sequencing mature, there is an increase in demand for integrative approaches to elucidate the rules underlying intrinsic, adaptive, and programmed phenotypic changes that cells undergo that can be inferred from such data. Our starting point will be to extend the pathway integrative framework developed over the past several years for the interpretation of cancer genomics datasets for the Cancer Genome Atlas project. Extensions to the input pathways used, and advances in the model to enrich the formal representation, will be developed so that a breadth of datasets in human and model organisms can be analyzed. The approach will culminate in the combining of machine-learning classification with probabilistic graphical models. The classifiers will identify predictive pathway features for cell state distinctions in a large database. Genetic manipulations among these features can then be proposed, in any combination, as formal interventions on the graphical model of the resulting classifiers, a major advantage of this work. The pathway models will be applied to the prediction of factors that can confer differentiation and de-differentiation queues to human cortical neurons. Computationally predicted gene perturbations in this system will be tested in living cells. Identifying critical modulators of the cell fate decisions underlying the conversion of stem cells to neural progenitors to mature neural cell types will advance our understanding of neural development. These same regulators may also play an important role in glioma, a disease where the tumor cells appear to be in a neural progenitor-like state. Taken together, the proposed theoretical and applied informatics approaches will contribute powerful tools for interpreting and predicting both routine and aberrant cellular responses. Researchers will be able to query the complex networks with computer algorithms as high fidelity surrogates. In the not so distant future, our hope is to advance our understanding of normal differentiation and shed light on how the regulation of these programs breaks down in disease processes like cancer, shedding light on diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to extend machine-learning and probabilistic graphical modeling approaches developed in the field of cancer genomics to the analysis of a broad range of human and model organism datasets. Novel methods for proposing genetic perturbations using a formal computational analysis will be developed and tested for their ability to suggest pluripotent and lineage-committing factors in a neural progenitor differentiation assay.

"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes.

"Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of the Data Generation Aim is to produce high quality data measuring phenotypes, protein and phosphoproteomics, and RNA expression in 30 cell lines grown on diverse microenvironments (ME). This approach will significantly enhance the LINCS data matrix by providing phenotypic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data for cell lines under unique ME conditions. Furthermore, the data will be utilized for subsequent generation of cellular network signatures in the Data Analysis Aim. Sub aim 1.1 will be generate 10 different phenotypic endpoints for 30 cell lines grown on 3,060 MEs. We will utilize Microenvironment    Microarrays (MEMA) to assess the effects of the ME on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation state, cell binding, and motility in each cell line. Statistical analysis will identify 50 significnt MEs for validation each year in years 2-6 in sub aim 1.2.A (total of 250 conditions). Each of the 50 ME conditions will be re-tested with the same endpoints at a second site using MEMA technology to provide independent validation of the primary results. At the same time, the cells will be tested using the 50 ME conditions on a second set of arrays designed to model the elastic modulus of human tissues to determine the effects on phenotypes of the matrix stiffness. From the 50 conditions tested in the validation aims, 30 of the most concordant between the primary and validation sites will be selected annually for analysis by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) aim 1.2.B and RNA expression analysis (aim I.2.C.). The RPPA aim will produce data using 500 validated antibodies against proteins and phosphoproteins in key signaling pathways under each of the ME perturbations. The RNA expression analysis will examine 1000 key genes using Luminex bead technology developed by the LINCS group at the Broad Institute, who will perform the same analysis for us using RNA prepared from each of the cell lines grown under the ME conditions. In total, the RPPA and RNA expression analysis will generate data for 150 different ME conditions under 2 different elastic moduli. All data will be carefully curated, with extensive metadata collected, and provided to the LINCS community for populating the data matrix.         Public Health Relevance: The main goals of the data generation aim will be to populate the LINCS data matrix with unique information that is currently not present in the matrix, and to provide data for generation of cellular network signatures. Our proposal to use MEMA technology will identify unique combinatorial MEs that perturb various phenotypic endpoints, providing novel data to fill in the LINCS data matrix.            ",Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks,8925126,U54HG008100,"['Adhesions', 'Antibodies', 'Apoptosis', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Databases', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Physiological', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Protein Array', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tern', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'human tissue', 'image processing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'senescence', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2015,1714600,0.04434260055073195
"Morphomic analysis of a simple chordate DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed collaborative project will investigate fundamental processes driving chordate embryogenesis. The project will combine the skills and expertise of two research groups: one that works in the area of developmental biology, and the other in the area of image analysis and computer vision. The goal of the project is take a whole-embryo embryo approach to investigating morphogenesis in live embryos in all 4 dimensions (x,y, z and t). Specifically, we will collect and analyze confocal microscopy images to derive quantitative data on the division, shape, volume and movements of all cells in both selected developing organs and in whole embryos. This project presents many challenges in sample selection and labeling, image capture, and image analysis and visualization. Most model organisms are fundamentally unsuited to the challenge of capturing the shape and movement of every cell in an entire tissue. Those that are suitable typically are distantly related to the chordates, and thus lack organs and tissues relevant to human health and disease. The ascidians (sea squirts), however, are close relatives of the vertebrates that combine a chordate body plan with a small and simple embryonic architecture suitable for imaging in toto. The data to be collected in such observations, particularly at the high resolution needed to observe cellular behavior, will be enormous. The extraction of large-scale quantitative information from timelapse image sets poses substantial challenges in terms of image segmentation and analysis. We have already made significant progress in segmenting 3D ascidian images and further refinements of these approaches are proposed here. The segmented data will allow the quantitative analysis of many complex cell behaviors, including the fundamental changes in cell shape and motility driving gastrulation, neurulation and convergent extension. These analyses will lead to specific hypotheses regarding the cellular and molecular machinery driving morphogenesis. To further investigate the molecular basis for these cellular phenomena, we will also extend our imaging and analysis efforts to investigate the dynamic patterns of subcellular localization of several proteins with key roles in morphogenesis. Organs and tissues are built during embryogenesis through the precise interactions of a myriad of cells and cell types. Advances in tissue repair and engineering will require that the rules and mechanisms that govern how cells come together to form organs and tissues be elucidated. The project proposed here will combine the efforts of developmental biologists and computer engineers to capture and analyze images from live embryos with the goal of understanding cell behaviors in forming organs.",Morphomic analysis of a simple chordate,8889279,R01HD059217,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Actins', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Organ', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell division', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroporation', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Movement', 'Myosin Light Chains', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nuclear', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Plasmids', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Seeds', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'System', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'ascidian', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blastomere structure', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'convergent extension', 'developmental genetics', 'gastrulation', 'image visualization', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging informatics', 'innovation', 'interest', 'moesin', 'professor', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein distribution', 'segmentation Image analysis', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue repair']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2015,317827,0.028258065774979725
"Dynamics of cellular senescence in single human cells Project Summary/Abstract  Dynamics of cellular senescence in single human cells  The goal of this proposal is to investigate the timing and control of cellular senescence in single human cells.  Senescence is a state of permanent cell cycle arrest and an inherent defense against tumor progression.  Exploiting senescence for therapeutic gain will require a better understanding of basic senescence biology,  novel experimental tools to study the phenotype at single-cell resolution, and computational approaches to  understand how cells integrate multiple senescence signals. This proposal provides a career transition plan for  Dr. Jeremy Purvis that will equip him with the additional training necessary to study senescence at single-cell  resolution and form the foundation for developing treatments that induce premature senescence in cells with  defective stress responses. During the mentored phase of the award (K99), he will develop a live-cell imaging  system for monitoring DNA damage-induced senescence in real time and use this system to determine how  upstream signaling of the tumor suppressor p53 control expression of senescence markers (Aim 1). This  critical phase of training will be co-supervised by Dr. Galit Lahav and Dr. Peter Sorger (Harvard Medical  School), who are both experts in time-lapse microscopy and cell fate decision processes. During the transition  to independence (K99/R00), he will identify transcriptional regulators that initiate expression of the key  senescence regulator p16INK4a and characterize the dynamics of this transition (Aim 2). The final step in  achieving independence (R00) will involve transferring these tools and concepts to study senescence in  primary cells lines, focusing specifically on how multiple signals are integrated to achieve a senescence  decision (Aim 3). This three-phase transition plan will illuminate our basic understanding of cellular  senescence and provide an extensible computational/experimental platform for identifying therapies that  induce premature senescence in cancer cells. These aims are highly congruent with the NIGMS's primary goal  of supporting basic discoveries that advance the treatment and prevention of human disease. Cellular senescence is a natural biological process that prevents cells from dividing; in some cases,  senescence stops the progression of cancer. The goal of this project is to understand how individual cells enter  senescence by observing this transition in real time.",Dynamics of cellular senescence in single human cells,8919404,R00GM102372,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'CDKN1A gene', 'CDKN2A gene', 'Cell Aging', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'End Point Assay', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genotoxic Stress', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Life', 'MAPK14 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Oncogene Activation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phase Transition', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein p53', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'cell fixing', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'imaging system', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'senescence', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R00,2015,279874,0.09364071184959699
"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells.

"Defining cell types, lineage, and connectivity in developing human fetal cortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Little is currently known about the number, proportion, or lineage of distinct cell types in the developing human fetal brain. Knowledge of such a component list and its functional genomic foundations is crucial for understanding the function of this complex system, its evolution, and how it is disrupted in disease. We hypothesize that comprehensive single-cell mRNA expression profiles provide an accurate and efficient rubric for a first generation classification schema that can be integrated with lineage, morphology and connectivity. We will use unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster 10,000 single cell transcriptomes derived from RNAseq of the human fetal cortical anlage, providing an unbiased model to identify and understand the resultant cell classes. We will validate these cell class determinations using in situ hybridization. We will use marker genes identified in this analysis to perform lineage tracing using cell-type specific reporters engineered via genome editing, and obtain single cell transcriptional profiles at different stages of development to determine lineage relationships. Finally, we will analyze intact fetal cerebral hemispheres and mouse-human chimeras processed with the CLARITY technique to provide 3D localization and morphology of a subset of cell types. To markedly improve scalability of this approach, we will apply enhanced Bessel Beam Tomography for spectral image acquisition, increasing imaging speed by 2-3 orders of magnitude while maintaining high resolution. In parallel, we will develop automated image analysis algorithms to enable cell detection and comprehensive morphological assessment in an automated and correctable fashion. Overall, completion of these studies will permit, among many future advances: (1) The generation of an unbiased rubric of cell class based on integration of morphological, transcriptomic, and connectivity data used to understand cell type diversity and function; (2) Connection of cellular function, morphology, and connectivity to specific genes and proteins; (3) Refinement of the cellular basis of transcriptomic disease signatures and understanding of the individual cellular mechanisms of disease (4) The construction of connectivity diagrams based on discovered circuit components allowing development of realistic computational models of brain function and dysfunction; (5) Optimization of cell types generated by in vitro stem cell models based on gold standard in vivo cell class definition; and (6) Advancement of light microscopy techniques for rapid, spectral high resolution imaging of postmortem human and mouse brain including automated processing, which in addition to permitting high throughput brain mapping, will significantly advance mechanistic studies in mouse models and pathological studies in human. Completion of these aims will provide a proof of principle, multiple tools, and a core framework on which to build a more comprehensive knowledge of cell classes in the human brain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing evidence implicates abnormalities in the development and architecture of the human cerebral cortex in neuropsychiatric illnesses such as autism and schizophrenia.

"Bleb Functions in 3D Morphogenesis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell migration is one of the most basic physiological processes. Even though the physical environment has been shown to regulate cell migration, most research has focused on cells migrating on rigid, 2D surfaces. In nature, cells migrate in 3D environments where they must constantly negotiate the balance between cellular and extracellular forces and between cellular and extracellular volumes. A striking feature of 3D migration is the frequent occurrence of blebs, which are hemispherical protrusions devoid of actin. The roles of these blebs have been little investigated. In particular it is still unknown ho, or even if, blebs directly enable motility by exerting forces on their environment. We hypothesize that blebs promote 3D motility under conditions in which pseudopodial extensions, which lead migration in 2D, mechanically stall and thus fail to allow directed migration. To test this hypothesis, we will develop computational tools to characterize 3D cell morphology in an unbiased manner, and to find, track, and classify protrusive structures such as blebs. To distinguish protrusive types, we will also develop tools to measure the localization of cortex-associated proteins. Since the collagen matrix plays an active and integral role in 3D cell migration, we will further develop tools to extract the locations and properties of the individual collagen fibrils that compose the collagen matrix. Migration results from the mechanical interaction of cells with their environment. We will therefore track how blebs and other protrusive structures interact with and deform individual collagen fibrils, and we will measure the localization of proteins at bleb-fibril interfaces. We additionally hypothesize that blebs play different functions in different mechanical environments. We will test this hypothesis by searching for mechanical environments in which blebs transition between functional states. In particular, we will begin to analyze plasticity between modes of blebbing motility by testing the hypothesis that, as collagen stiffness is increased, blebbing gradually transitions from pushing fibrils away to interdigitating pores, and thus both functional bleb types can coexist in the same cell. Together, this work will refocus migration research on a model centered on cell-environment interactions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cell migration is key to processes as diverse as embryogenesis, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. In nature and within our own bodies, cells migrate in varied and complicated 3D environments, yet most cell migration research has focused on cells migrating on flat surfaces. We propose to develop computational tools to analyze 3D images of migrating cells and use these tools to study the physical basis of 3D cell migration.            ",Bleb Functions in 3D Morphogenesis,8981713,F32GM116370,"['Actins', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Biological Models', 'Bulla', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cellular biology', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Fibril', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dissociation', 'Embryonic Development', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Filopodia', 'Focal Adhesions', 'Geometry', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immigration', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Physical environment', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Price', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Veins', 'Work', 'Wound Healing', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cell motility', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular imaging', 'neuronal cell body', 'polymerization', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F32,2015,56894,0.08292219742871965
"Machine learning methods to impute and annotate epigenomic maps     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Program has produced reference epigenomic maps derived from a variety of human primary cells and tissues, including pluripotent cell types and in vitro differentiated forms, highly purified primar cells, and a range of fetal and adult tissues. The goal of the proposed project is to develop, validate and apply unsupervised machine learning methods to the joint analysis of these epigenomic maps along with (1) data generated by the NIH ENCODE Consortium, (2) a variety of publicly available data sets that characterize the three-dimensional structure of DNA in the nucleus, and (3) information about evolutionary conservation, represented by cross-species DNA alignments. The first aim of the project will use data imputation methods to carry out virtual functional genomics experiments. The proposed method is based on techniques developed in the context of recommender systems, but is extended to model dependencies along the genomic axis. By simultaneously analyzing the pattern of biochemical activity across a range of cell types and assay types, the proposed imputation method will accurately predict the results of an assay, such as ChIP-seq for a particular histone modification in a particular cell type, that has not yet been carried out. We will systematically apply this method to Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE data, filling in missing experiments in the matrix of cell types and assay types. The remaining three specific aims extend and apply our existing system for semi-automated genome annotation, Segway, which integrates a wide variety of functional genomics data into a human interpretable labeling of genomic elements. These analyses will be performed on real data as well as the virtual experiments from Aim 1. We propose a novel, graph-based regularization scheme and show how, using this approach, we can use Segway to perform integrated analysis of data across cell types and integrate 3D genome architecture information from assays such as Hi-C. We also propose a post-processing method to exploit patterns of evolutionary conservation to identify functionally important labels in the resulting annotations. The primary deliverables will include novel software for imputation and annotation, as well as publicly available sets of virtual experiments and genome annotations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH has recently expended substantial effort to generate raw data that characterizes the human epigenome across a variety of cell types. This proposal uses machine learning methods to help make sense of this large collection of epigenomic maps, combining the maps with data generated by the NIH ENCODE Consortium, information about the 3D structure of DNA, and information about evolutionary conservation. The project will produce novel computational methods as well as two primary analysis products: virtual experiments for combinations of assays and cell types that have not yet been carried out and annotations that identify various types of biochemical and functional activity along the human genome.            ",Machine learning methods to impute and annotate epigenomic maps,8814095,R01ES024917,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virtual Library', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer based statistical methods', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'fetal', 'functional genomics', 'genome annotation', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'markov model', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virtual']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,285064,0.04380911138077135

"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular signatures of human neurons we identify can be used to provide insights into the molecular factors that distinguish central neurons from healthy people from those of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, SMA, PD and HD. These insights will provide molecular targets that can be used to develop new drugs to block the progression of these diseases which are presently untreatable.            ",Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells,8787830,U54NS091046,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Network-based', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Online Systems', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Scourge', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'disease-causing mutation', 'epigenomics', 'genome sequencing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'molecular phenotype', 'outreach program', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'statistics', 'stem cell technology', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,U54,2014,334000,0.08821222879734916
"New Integrative Pathway Analysis Methods to Predict Biomedical Outcomes  The long-term goal of this research is to reveal the key regulators that determine the usually ordered development of an animal from undifferentiated pluripotent cells to specialized cells that carry out all of the functions in our body. The coordinated expression of the genome underlies these processes and is orchestrated by networks of interacting genes that we are only beginning to unveil. Cell circuitry is complex but the discovery of the Yamanaka factors demonstrates that even less than a handful of transcription factors can exert profound changes on cell and tissue fates. Thus, the combinations of genes needed to unlock cell determinants seem tantalizingly parsimonious. Large-scale projects are underway to catalog the genomic, epigenomic, and functional genomic landscapes of many different cells in multiple different organisms. As high- throughput techniques such as DNA and RNA sequencing mature, there is an increase in demand for integrative approaches to elucidate the rules underlying intrinsic, adaptive, and programmed phenotypic changes that cells undergo that can be inferred from such data. Our starting point will be to extend the pathway integrative framework developed over the past several years for the interpretation of cancer genomics datasets for the Cancer Genome Atlas project. Extensions to the input pathways used, and advances in the model to enrich the formal representation, will be developed so that a breadth of datasets in human and model organisms can be analyzed. The approach will culminate in the combining of machine-learning classification with probabilistic graphical models. The classifiers will identify predictive pathway features for cell state distinctions in a large database. Genetic manipulations among these features can then be proposed, in any combination, as formal interventions on the graphical model of the resulting classifiers, a major advantage of this work. The pathway models will be applied to the prediction of factors that can confer differentiation and de-differentiation queues to human cortical neurons. Computationally predicted gene perturbations in this system will be tested in living cells. Identifying critical modulators of the cell fate decisions underlying the conversion of stem cells to neural progenitors to mature neural cell types will advance our understanding of neural development. These same regulators may also play an important role in glioma, a disease where the tumor cells appear to be in a neural progenitor-like state. Taken together, the proposed theoretical and applied informatics approaches will contribute powerful tools for interpreting and predicting both routine and aberrant cellular responses. Researchers will be able to query the complex networks with computer algorithms as high fidelity surrogates. In the not so distant future, our hope is to advance our understanding of normal differentiation and shed light on how the regulation of these programs breaks down in disease processes like cancer, shedding light on diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to extend machine-learning and probabilistic graphical modeling approaches developed in the field of cancer genomics to the analysis of a broad range of human and model organism datasets. Novel methods for proposing genetic perturbations using a formal computational analysis will be developed and tested for their ability to suggest pluripotent and lineage-committing factors in a neural progenitor differentiation assay. The methods developed will contribute significant theoretical advances as well as reveal common mechanisms of stem cells and tumor biology to shed light on new treatment options for cancer.            ",New Integrative Pathway Analysis Methods to Predict Biomedical Outcomes,8615841,R01GM109031,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Embryo', 'Equilibrium', 'Future', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'RNA Sequences', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simulate', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Biology', 'Undifferentiated', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell type', 'daughter cell', 'developmental disease', 'drug sensitivity', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic manipulation', 'human stem cells', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'neoplastic cell', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stemness', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R01,2014,559926,0.0560123443299571
"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease networks are complex interactions between multiple proteins. Precise understanding of the multifactorial perturbations imposed on multi-component networks is a crucial step in the development of a rational approach to drug discovery and personalization of therapy.

"Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of the Data Generation Aim is to produce high quality data measuring phenotypes, protein and phosphoproteomics, and RNA expression in 30 cell lines grown on diverse microenvironments (ME). This approach will significantly enhance the LINCS data matrix by providing phenotypic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data for cell lines under unique ME conditions. Furthermore, the data will be utilized for subsequent generation of cellular network signatures in the Data Analysis Aim. Sub aim 1.1 will be generate 10 different phenotypic endpoints for 30 cell lines grown on 3,060 MEs. We will utilize Microenvironment    Microarrays (MEMA) to assess the effects of the ME on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation state, cell binding, and motility in each cell line. Statistical analysis will identify 50 significnt MEs for validation each year in years 2-6 in sub aim 1.2.A (total of 250 conditions). Each of the 50 ME conditions will be re-tested with the same endpoints at a second site using MEMA technology to provide independent validation of the primary results. At the same time, the cells will be tested using the 50 ME conditions on a second set of arrays designed to model the elastic modulus of human tissues to determine the effects on phenotypes of the matrix stiffness. From the 50 conditions tested in the validation aims, 30 of the most concordant between the primary and validation sites will be selected annually for analysis by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) aim 1.2.B and RNA expression analysis (aim I.2.C.). The RPPA aim will produce data using 500 validated antibodies against proteins and phosphoproteins in key signaling pathways under each of the ME perturbations. The RNA expression analysis will examine 1000 key genes using Luminex bead technology developed by the LINCS group at the Broad Institute, who will perform the same analysis for us using RNA prepared from each of the cell lines grown under the ME conditions. In total, the RPPA and RNA expression analysis will generate data for 150 different ME conditions under 2 different elastic moduli. All data will be carefully curated, with extensive metadata collected, and provided to the LINCS community for populating the data matrix.         Public Health Relevance: The main goals of the data generation aim will be to populate the LINCS data matrix with unique information that is currently not present in the matrix, and to provide data for generation of cellular network signatures.

"Morphomic analysis of a simple chordate     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed collaborative project will investigate fundamental processes driving chordate embryogenesis. The project will combine the skills and expertise of two research groups: one that works in the area of developmental biology, and the other in the area of image analysis and computer vision. The goal of the project is take a whole-embryo embryo approach to investigating morphogenesis in live embryos in all 4 dimensions (x,y, z and t). Specifically, we will collect and analyze confocal microscopy images to derive quantitative data on the division, shape, volume and movements of all cells in both selected developing organs and in whole embryos. This project presents many challenges in sample selection and labeling, image capture, and image analysis and visualization. Most model organisms are fundamentally unsuited to the challenge of capturing the shape and movement of every cell in an entire tissue. Those that are suitable typically are distantly related to the chordates, and thus lack organs and tissues relevant to human health and disease. The ascidians (sea squirts), however, are close relatives of the vertebrates that combine a chordate body plan with a small and simple embryonic architecture suitable for imaging in toto. The data to be collected in such observations, particularly at the high resolution needed to observe cellular behavior, will be enormous. The extraction of large-scale quantitative information from timelapse image sets poses substantial challenges in terms of image segmentation and analysis. We have already made significant progress in segmenting 3D ascidian images and further refinements of these approaches are proposed here. The segmented data will allow the quantitative analysis of many complex cell behaviors, including the fundamental changes in cell shape and motility driving gastrulation, neurulation and convergent extension. These analyses will lead to specific hypotheses regarding the cellular and molecular machinery driving morphogenesis. To further investigate the molecular basis for these cellular phenomena, we will also extend our imaging and analysis efforts to investigate the dynamic patterns of subcellular localization of several proteins with key roles in morphogenesis.          Organs and tissues are built during embryogenesis through the precise interactions of a myriad of cells and cell types. Advances in tissue repair and engineering will require that the rules and mechanisms that govern how cells come together to form organs and tissues be elucidated. The project proposed here will combine the efforts of developmental biologists and computer engineers to capture and analyze images from live embryos with the goal of understanding cell behaviors in forming organs.

"Dynamics of cellular senescence in single human cells Admin Supplement Project Summary/Abstract  Dynamics of cellular senescence in single human cells  The goal of this proposal is to investigate the timing and control of cellular senescence in single human cells.  Senescence is a state of permanent cell cycle arrest and an inherent defense against tumor progression.  Exploiting senescence for therapeutic gain will require a better understanding of basic senescence biology,  novel experimental tools to study the phenotype at single-cell resolution, and computational approaches to  understand how cells integrate multiple senescence signals.

"Dynamics of cellular senescence in single human cells Project Summary/Abstract  Dynamics of cellular senescence in single human cells  The goal of this proposal is to investigate the timing and control of cellular senescence in single human cells.  Senescence is a state of permanent cell cycle arrest and an inherent defense against tumor progression.

"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity     DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications.

"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders. Our application of this system to generate cell-lineage specific functional networks will lead to a better understanding of the glomerulus function and will directly benefit human health through the development of improved predictors, diagnoses, and treatments for microvascular disease.

"Defining cell types, lineage, and connectivity in developing human fetal cortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Little is currently known about the number, proportion, or lineage of distinct cell types in the developing human fetal brain. Knowledge of such a component list and its functional genomic foundations is crucial for understanding the function of this complex system, its evolution, and how it is disrupted in disease. We hypothesize that comprehensive single-cell mRNA expression profiles provide an accurate and efficient rubric for a first generation classification schema that can be integrated with lineage, morphology and connectivity. We will use unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster 10,000 single cell transcriptomes derived from RNAseq of the human fetal cortical anlage, providing an unbiased model to identify and understand the resultant cell classes. We will validate these cell class determinations using in situ hybridization. We will use marker genes identified in this analysis to perform lineage tracing using cell-type specific reporters engineered via genome editing, and obtain single cell transcriptional profiles at different stages of development to determine lineage relationships. Finally, we will analyze intact fetal cerebral hemispheres and mouse-human chimeras processed with the CLARITY technique to provide 3D localization and morphology of a subset of cell types. To markedly improve scalability of this approach, we will apply enhanced Bessel Beam Tomography for spectral image acquisition, increasing imaging speed by 2-3 orders of magnitude while maintaining high resolution. In parallel, we will develop automated image analysis algorithms to enable cell detection and comprehensive morphological assessment in an automated and correctable fashion. Overall, completion of these studies will permit, among many future advances: (1) The generation of an unbiased rubric of cell class based on integration of morphological, transcriptomic, and connectivity data used to understand cell type diversity and function; (2) Connection of cellular function, morphology, and connectivity to specific genes and proteins; (3) Refinement of the cellular basis of transcriptomic disease signatures and understanding of the individual cellular mechanisms of disease (4) The construction of connectivity diagrams based on discovered circuit components allowing development of realistic computational models of brain function and dysfunction; (5) Optimization of cell types generated by in vitro stem cell models based on gold standard in vivo cell class definition; and (6) Advancement of light microscopy techniques for rapid, spectral high resolution imaging of postmortem human and mouse brain including automated processing, which in addition to permitting high throughput brain mapping, will significantly advance mechanistic studies in mouse models and pathological studies in human. Completion of these aims will provide a proof of principle, multiple tools, and a core framework on which to build a more comprehensive knowledge of cell classes in the human brain.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing evidence implicates abnormalities in the development and architecture of the human cerebral cortex in neuropsychiatric illnesses such as autism and schizophrenia. Understanding the pathological disruption of a complex system such as the human cortex first requires an understanding of its components: individual cells. We will develop novel methods and tools to identify the individual cell classes that compose the human fetal cortex, determine the lineage of progenitor cell classes, and map the location, morphology, and connectivity of each cell class.                ","Defining cell types, lineage, and connectivity in developing human fetal cortex",8822765,U01MH105991,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Categories', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebral hemisphere', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Chimera organism', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stem cells', 'Surface', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'density', 'fetal', 'frontal lobe', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'light microscopy', 'mRNA Expression', 'method development', 'molecular phenotype', 'mouse model', 'neocortical', 'nerve stem cell', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'population based', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'rapid technique', 'sound', 'statistics', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2014,875397,0.11395196816711228

This high instrument combines a high scan-rate confocal imaging device, an environmental chamber, 4-channel fluorescence, transmitted light and on-board fluid addition in a microplate-based system. The InCell 6000 permits automated, high throughput and high temporal and spatial resolution of subcelluar structures and biochemical reactions that are the basis of all cellular and tissue functions. The long-term objective is to extend our present capabilities in acquiring high temporal, spatial and spectral images from a small sample size to the acquisition of large data sets from populations of cells on a cell-by-cell basis, tissue models and experimental animals. This new capability will permit the application of computational and systems biology tools to understand the complexities of life processes based on statistical significance not possible before. The integration of the best biological experimental systems, fluorescence-based reagents and high throughput, automated imaging will enable large, combinatorial treatments of samples to allow the exploration of statistically relevant mechanisms of action in a variety of therapeutic areas. The NIH funded projects that will use this instrument include investigations on human adipocyte differentiation in cancer, the physiology of stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, the heterogeneity of drug responses in head and neck cancer models, the role of the immune response in cancer therapies, live, 3D breast cancer models with the analysis of pathways, cell migration in tumor models, modulation of Huntington's Disease progression in model systems, protein misfolding disease model of alpha 1- antitrypsin deficiency (ATD), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) models in C. elgans.

"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians Abstract Project Summary Urban intersections are among the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Building on our past work on a prototype ""Crosswatch"" system that uses computer vision algorithms to find crosswalks and Walk lights, we will greatly enhance the functionality of the system with information about the intersection layout and the identity of its connecting streets, the presence of stop signs, one-way signs and other controls indicating right-of-way, and timing information integrated from Walk/Don't Walk lights, countdown timers and other traffic lights. The system will convey intersection information, and will actively guide the user to align himself/herself with crosswalks, using a combination of synthesized speech and audio tones. We will conduct human factors studies to optimize the system functionality and the configuration of the user interface, as well as develop interactive training applications to equip users with the skills to better use the system. These training applications, implemented as additional cell phone software to complement the intersection system, will train users to hold the camera horizontal and forward and to minimize veer when traversing a crosswalk. The intersection analysis and training software will be made freely available for download onto popular cell phones (such as iPhone, Android or Symbian models). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software. Ultimately a user will be able to download an entire suite of such algorithms for free onto the cell phone he or she is already likely to be carrying, without having to carry a separate piece of equipment for each function.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task.

"Dynamics of cellular senescence in single human cells Project Summary/Abstract  Dynamics of cellular senescence in single human cells  The goal of this proposal is to investigate the timing and control of cellular senescence in single human cells.  Senescence is a state of permanent cell cycle arrest and an inherent defense against tumor progression.  Exploiting senescence for therapeutic gain will require a better understanding of basic senescence biology,  novel experimental tools to study the phenotype at single-cell resolution, and computational approaches to  understand how cells integrate multiple senescence signals. This proposal provides a career transition plan for  Dr. Jeremy Purvis that will equip him with the additional training necessary to study senescence at single-cell  resolution and form the foundation for developing treatments that induce premature senescence in cells with  defective stress responses. During the mentored phase of the award (K99), he will develop a live-cell imaging  system for monitoring DNA damage-induced senescence in real time and use this system to determine how  upstream signaling of the tumor suppressor p53 control expression of senescence markers (Aim 1). This  critical phase of training will be co-supervised by Dr. Galit Lahav and Dr. Peter Sorger (Harvard Medical  School), who are both experts in time-lapse microscopy and cell fate decision processes. During the transition  to independence (K99/R00), he will identify transcriptional regulators that initiate expression of the key  senescence regulator p16INK4a and characterize the dynamics of this transition (Aim 2).

"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders. Our application of this system to generate cell-lineage specific functional networks will lead to a better understanding of the glomerulus function and will directly benefit human health through the development of improved predictors, diagnoses, and treatments for microvascular disease.

"Efficient patient-specific cell generation by image-guidance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This fast-track proposal applies advanced kinetic image pattern recognition (KIPR) technologies to predict induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming colonies' differentiation outcomes for significantly improved yield and robustness of differentiation protocols. The objectives of the proposed tool are 1) Teaching: creation of scores for induced colony differentiation outcome prediction by machine learning; 2) Reprogramming: optimal reprogramming harvest time determination by continuous colony score monitoring; 3) Differentiation: selection of colonies with the highest prediction scores for differentiation at the reprogramming harvest time; 4) Differentiation: cell cluster quality control by continuous monitoring during differentiation. The specific aims of this fast-track proposal are Phase I: 1) Extend SVCell for the prediction of induced colony differentiation outcomes ; 2) Validate that prediction of colony differentiation outcomes can improve the yield of CM differentiation. Phase II: 1) Validate that the integrated system can be taught to be robust and high yielding for a diverse set of human fibroblast input samples and different reprogramming / differentiation protocols; 2) Integrate SVCell with a state-of-the-art continuous cell imaging and culture system to create a prototype patient-specific cell generation system; 3) Validate the integrated system as a patient-specific cell generation product. The ultimate goal of this fast-track proposal is to develop and validate an image-guided efficient patient-specific cardiomyocyte generation system. This will be achieved by integrating our established SVCell software containing advanced KIPR technologies with a live cell imaging technology to synthesize state-of-the-art cell fate control protocols against iPSC.

"Functional Classification of Cardiomyocytes Derived from Stem Cells    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the United States each year for both women and men. Although significant advances have been made in conventional drug and device therapies in recent years, they have not been able to reverse the loss of functional myocardium. Regeneration of the heart may someday be possible with the ability to derive functional cardiomyocytes from human stem cells. However, before these cells can be used for cardiac repair, more must be known about their electrophysiology and their likelihood to seamlessly integrate with native cardiac tissue. In particular, it is of critical importance to establish the electrophysiological compatibility of these cells with host myocardium to minimize the risk of arrhythmia. Despite this critical need, the classification of the electrophysiological phenotypes has been largely subjective for all cell types that have been studied so far, relying mainly on parameters related to action potential shape.  The overall goal of this project is to develop a new, analytical and automated method to classify newly differentiated cardiac cells, based on techniques developed for machine learning. The specific aims are first, to use optical mapping and microelectrode recordings to generate datasets of functional electrophysiological characteristics of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs), and second, to use machine learning techniques to classify the phenotypes of the hESC-CMs, based on parametric descriptions. These techniques will involve linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms, and clustering and classification algorithms. Cells at different stages of differentiation will be evaluated at different pacing and pharmacological conditions that will help to establish the functional properties of the cells.  In summary, the proposed research will enable the classification of cardiomyocytes that are derived from human stem cells. The ability to classify and identify cardiomyocyte phenotypes will permit a quantitative assessment of the batch-to-batch variability in cell cultures, the effect of different differentiation procedures, and the evolution of phenotypes during cardiomyocyte differentiation and maturation. These are critically important issues for the future clinical application of these cells to regenerate cardiac tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stem cell therapy holds great potential for treating diseased and failing hearts, but still faces significant challenges. This project addresses the electrophysiological aspects these cells, and the goal is to develop methods that can classify and identify the variety of heart cells that are derived from different kinds of stem cells.

"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians Abstract Project Summary Urban intersections are among the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Building on our past work on a prototype ""Crosswatch"" system that uses computer vision algorithms to find crosswalks and Walk lights, we will greatly enhance the functionality of the system with information about the intersection layout and the identity of its connecting streets, the presence of stop signs, one-way signs and other controls indicating right-of-way, and timing information integrated from Walk/Don't Walk lights, countdown timers and other traffic lights. The system will convey intersection information, and will actively guide the user to align himself/herself with crosswalks, using a combination of synthesized speech and audio tones. We will conduct human factors studies to optimize the system functionality and the configuration of the user interface, as well as develop interactive training applications to equip users with the skills to better use the system. These training applications, implemented as additional cell phone software to complement the intersection system, will train users to hold the camera horizontal and forward and to minimize veer when traversing a crosswalk. The intersection analysis and training software will be made freely available for download onto popular cell phones (such as iPhone, Android or Symbian models). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software. Ultimately a user will be able to download an entire suite of such algorithms for free onto the cell phone he or she is already likely to be carrying, without having to carry a separate piece of equipment for each function.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task. The proposed research would result in a highly accessible system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to augment existing wayfinding techniques, which could dramatically improve independent travel for blind and visually impaired persons.

"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders.

"Functional Classification of Cardiomyocytes Derived from Stem Cells    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the United States each year for both women and men. Although significant advances have been made in conventional drug and device therapies in recent years, they have not been able to reverse the loss of functional myocardium. Regeneration of the heart may someday be possible with the ability to derive functional cardiomyocytes from human stem cells. However, before these cells can be used for cardiac repair, more must be known about their electrophysiology and their likelihood to seamlessly integrate with native cardiac tissue. In particular, it is of critical importance to establish the electrophysiological compatibility of these cells with host myocardium to minimize the risk of arrhythmia. Despite this critical need, the classification of the electrophysiological phenotypes has been largely subjective for all cell types that have been studied so far, relying mainly on parameters related to action potential shape.  The overall goal of this project is to develop a new, analytical and automated method to classify newly differentiated cardiac cells, based on techniques developed for machine learning. The specific aims are first, to use optical mapping and microelectrode recordings to generate datasets of functional electrophysiological characteristics of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs), and second, to use machine learning techniques to classify the phenotypes of the hESC-CMs, based on parametric descriptions. These techniques will involve linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms, and clustering and classification algorithms. Cells at different stages of differentiation will be evaluated at different pacing and pharmacological conditions that will help to establish the functional properties of the cells.  In summary, the proposed research will enable the classification of cardiomyocytes that are derived from human stem cells. The ability to classify and identify cardiomyocyte phenotypes will permit a quantitative assessment of the batch-to-batch variability in cell cultures, the effect of different differentiation procedures, and the evolution of phenotypes during cardiomyocyte differentiation and maturation. These are critically important issues for the future clinical application of these cells to regenerate cardiac tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stem cell therapy holds great potential for treating diseased and failing hearts, but still faces significant challenges.

"Efficient patient-specific cell generation by image-guidance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This fast-track proposal applies advanced kinetic image pattern recognition (KIPR) technologies to predict induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming colonies' differentiation outcomes for significantly improved yield and robustness of differentiation protocols. The objectives of the proposed tool are 1) Teaching: creation of scores for induced colony differentiation outcome prediction by machine learning; 2) Reprogramming: optimal reprogramming harvest time determination by continuous colony score monitoring; 3) Differentiation: selection of colonies with the highest prediction scores for differentiation at the reprogramming harvest time; 4) Differentiation: cell cluster quality control by continuous monitoring during differentiation.

"Predict transcriptional enhancers using epigenetic signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of eukaryotic gene transcription involves the coordination of a multitude of transcription factors and cofactors on regulatory DNA sequences such as promoters and enhancers and on the chromatin structure containing these elements. Therefore, identification of these regulatory DNA elements is of utmost importance for understanding gene regulation in both healthy and diseased cells. Previous studies have demonstrated many characteristic epigenetic modifications occur at regulatory DNA elements, e.g., high levels of histone acetylation at gene promoters and at many enhancers. In addition, it is known that many regulatory elements carry these epigenetic modifications only in specific cell/tissue types or according to environmental conditions. In recent years, a vast amount of genome-wide histone modification data has been generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip (ChIP-chip) or with next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq). Currently, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze genome-wide histone modification data in order to identify functional DNA elements.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel computational method to identify transcriptional regulatory elements on the basis of their epigenetic characteristics. In the field of machine learning, it is well established that meaningful statistical features extracted from raw data can elude more relevant information and increase the prediction accuracy of a classifier. We hypothesize that by introducing efficient data transformation and feature extraction procedures before classification, we can increase the overall prediction accuracy of our method for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. We propose to test the aforementioned hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: (1) We will adopt well-established measures from signal processing to design and test a set of statistical features that could give us a better representation of signals in histone modification data. (2) We will evaluate the performance of several commonly used statistical classifiers in predicting enhancers. We will then develop a software tool combining the most informative features from Aim 1 with the optimal classifier. (3) We will apply our computational method to predict novel enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cell and human T cell using genome-wide histone modification maps in these two cell types. We will use both computational and experimental approaches to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Although in this project we focus on enhancers, the approach we develop can be readily extended to discover other types of functional DNA elements using histone modification data in different organisms and cell types. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

Successful completion of the project will also uncover novel enhancers in two biomedically important cell types, embryonic stem cell and T lymphocyte, which could generate new insights into the regulatory networks controlling stem cell phenotype and T cell development and activation.              Narrative: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

"Integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in multiple cell types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics, and specific Challenge Topic, 08-OD-101, Computational approaches for epigenomic analysis. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence. These epigenetic modifications lead to the diversity of function across different human cell types, and play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during development, and also in health and disease. The human ENCODE project, the NIH Epigenome Roadmap, and several other large-scale experimental efforts are currently underway to map dozens of histone and DNA modifications across multiple human cell types and disease states, generating a diversity of rich epigenomic datasets. This creates a pressing need for the development of rigorous computational methods for the systematic integrative analysis of epigenomic datasets, and for understanding their relationship to other genomic datasets, including gene expression, disease association, and phenotypic profiling. In this proposal, we will develop and apply graphical probabilistic models for describing chromatin modifications, based on multivariate hidden Markov models. We will use these models to discover the set of underlying chromatin state, based on recurrent combinations of epigenetic marks across the entire genome (Aim 1). We will validate and functionally characterize these states based on their enrichments and positional biases with respect to existing functional elements, as well as large-scale gene expression and disease association datasets (Aim 2). Lastly, we will extend these methods to study dynamics of chromatin state across both healthy and disease cell types, and study how these correlate with functional differences between the observed cell types (Aim 3). We will work closely with the scientists involved in data production and facilitate communication and data integration across them, and also with data analysis and coordination centers already established to facilitate sharing of methods and results across the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap consortia, and with the larger community. Overall, the proposed integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets will provide a unified view of current and planned epigenomic datasets, towards a systematic understanding of gene and genome regulation in health and disease. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence, leading to the diversity of function across different human cell types. This project will create a computational framework and resource to integrate large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets, to understand their functional role in health and disease, and to understand their dynamics across different cell lines and disease states.

"Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is a Fast-Track application to provide reliable, cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in cancer biopsies to assist pharmaceutical drug development and provision of patient-specific prognosis and therapy guidance (""personalized medicine""). The organizing theme is that the appropriate unit of analysis should be the individual cell as opposed to averaged tumor extracts. To this end, novel technologies will be coupled with careful methods-development. Spectral imaging and advanced image analysis tools will permit multi-target immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or immunofluorescence (IF) detection, at the cellular and subcellular level in intact tissue sections. CRi-developed image processing and machine-learning tools provide automation and sophisticated quantitation options. Multiplexed staining protocols will yield independent, potentially stoichiometric labeling with combined IHC and IF. The sensitivity of all potential markers to variations in tissue handling will be carefully assessed; some may be robust and suitable for archival tissue studies, others will be too labile. Ultrasound-assisted fixation will be tested for its ability to preserve such labile epitopes for use in prospectively acquired tissues. Four or more pathway-related proteins will be detected in tissue sections, on a cell-by-cell basis, even if co-localized and with spectrally overlapping labels. The coordinated subcellular location of the pathway molecules will be also tracked, with simultaneous assessment of cell-surface receptors (e.g., EGFR, VEGF, Her2-neu), downstream signaling proteins and phosphoproteins (e.g., pAKT, pERK), nuclear proteins (e.g., ER, Ki67), and novel players such as protein-folding mediators (e.g. BIP1).       The project will combine optimized tissue protocols, multiplexed IHC/IF reagent kits, and unique machine- learning image analysis that can be used to automate region-detection and label-quantitation. All these depend on CRi's multispectral imaging approaches for assessing multiple analytes on a cell-by-cell and cell- compartment basis in tissue sections. Our collaborators will provide small-animal tumor models for early methods development, multiplexed immunohistochemical labeling of pathway proteins in clinical cancer biopsies, access to archived and prospectively acquired tissues from pathway-targeting clinical drug trials, highly informative archival tissue microarrays, access to validated, activation-specific antibodies, ultra-fast tissue fixation, and biostatistics support. The ""deliverable"" will be a suite of products suitable for clinical use that can provide much-needed valid information on single-cell-based pathway status in an intact tissue context to support pharmaceutical drug development efforts and provide molecularly focused patient care.       Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine, which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific patients. Conventional molecular pathology methods are typically limited to a single immunohistochemical (IHC) test on a given tissue section or to expensive and time-consuming proteomics or expression-array approaches (which cannot directly report out pathway activation status in cancer cell populations and subpopulations). Multiplexed IHC (including immuno-fluorescence) combined with optimized sample handling protocols to retain pathway proteins and advanced image analysis will enable the unambiguous detection of active signaling pathways, benefiting pharmaceutical research in the selection of patients for better targeted trials and in the monitoring of response, and clinical practice for diagnosis, therapy selection, and monitoring response (i.e., theranostics).          n/a",Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging,8019130,R44CA130026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Avastin', 'BAY 54-9085', 'BIK gene', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'British Columbia', 'CD34 gene', 'Calibration', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Correlative Study', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'Employment', 'Energy Transfer', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Fixatives', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Reagent', 'Receptor Activation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roche brand of trastuzumab', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transillumination', 'Translating', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Weight', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'clinical material', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lapatinib', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'member', 'method development', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'nanoparticle', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'protein folding', 'research study', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'statistics', 'subcutaneous', 'theranostics', 'tissue culture', 'tissue processing', 'tissue/cell culture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R44,2011,783061,0.03425364700441769
"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians Abstract Project Summary Urban intersections are among the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Building on our past work on a prototype ""Crosswatch"" system that uses computer vision algorithms to find crosswalks and Walk lights, we will greatly enhance the functionality of the system with information about the intersection layout and the identity of its connecting streets, the presence of stop signs, one-way signs and other controls indicating right-of-way, and timing information integrated from Walk/Don't Walk lights, countdown timers and other traffic lights. The system will convey intersection information, and will actively guide the user to align himself/herself with crosswalks, using a combination of synthesized speech and audio tones. We will conduct human factors studies to optimize the system functionality and the configuration of the user interface, as well as develop interactive training applications to equip users with the skills to better use the system. These training applications, implemented as additional cell phone software to complement the intersection system, will train users to hold the camera horizontal and forward and to minimize veer when traversing a crosswalk. The intersection analysis and training software will be made freely available for download onto popular cell phones (such as iPhone, Android or Symbian models). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software. Ultimately a user will be able to download an entire suite of such algorithms for free onto the cell phone he or she is already likely to be carrying, without having to carry a separate piece of equipment for each function.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task.

"Computational Modeling of Cell Migration in 3D Matrices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to construct and test predictive computational models for how diverse intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments. Our technical approach comprises several features in innovative combination: {1} 3D quantitative tracking of individual cell migration parameters within relevant biomacromolecular matrices; {2} quantitative biochemical measurements of key intracellular signals during this 3D migration; {3} modulation of these signals by genetic manipulation of receptor properties and by pharmacological inhibition of key molecular switches; {4} computational modeling of the quantitative relationship of these signals to the consequent migration response; and {5} experimental test of non-intuitive model predictions. We focus on signals and responses induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) cues. Signals generated downstream of ErbB family receptor ligand binding strongly influence migration response behavior of many cell types, including carcinoma cells during tumor progression to invasion and metastasis. This paradigmatic ""cue-signal- response"" system is important physiologically during organogenesis and tissue regeneration, and when aberrant enables the pathology of tumor invasion and dissemination. Thus, understanding how the signaling control is exerted quantitatively should have broadly relevant and useful implications for both basic science and therapeutic applications. Although a multitude of individual components in the ErbB signaling network have been identified, quantitative models integratively relating these divergent signaling pathways to migration response behavior are only now emerging. Very little fundamental work on signaling governing migration has been performed in 3D environments that truly represent the barriers to tumor invasion and dissemination. Our work intimately integrates computational modeling with dedicated quantitative experimental measurement of ErbB family-induced cell migration and signaling network activity within 3D matrices. Our modeling approach will focus not on the more commonly-pursued ""cue-signal"" facet (that of signal generation from ligand/receptor cues, but instead the sorely under-addressed ""signal-response"" facet. Although it is clear that multiple signaling pathways downstream of ErbB receptors can play significant roles in regulating migration, what is not understood is how multi-pathway networks quantitatively integrate to yield the observed phenotypic behavior. This question will be addressed using the statistical modeling framework known as Decision Tree analysis, which defines a control hierarchy relating logical combinations of signals to the migration behavioral response across all cue conditions. Our goal for the proposed grant is to apply decision tree modeling to prediction of effects of ErbB receptor signaling on epithelial and carcinoma cell migration through three-dimensional matrices.

"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders.

"Real-time computer vision tracking of stemness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the need for new stem cell engineering toolsets that can regulate adult stem cell expansion (self-renewal, without differentiation) ex vivo in order to create sufficient numbers of cells for clinical applications. The goals of this proposal are to: 1) develop a computer vision system that tracks in real-time the spatiotemporal histories of cell divisions in vitro in phase-contrast imagery; 2) use this data to automatically derive real-time metrics of symmetry, division times, confluence, and predictive population growth models; and, 3) apply this system to develop novel strategies that maximize the yield of adult stem cell expansion in growth factor-mediated conditions. 'Real-time' means that processing is completed 'on-line' in the 15 minute intervals between image acquisitions, and this information is available during cell culture as feedback for process monitoring and control. In Aim 1, robust image segmentation and tracking of dense cell populations will be achieved using multi-modal cell tracking modules that represent and reason about cell states and motion from different perspectives, and then fuse and coordinate their respective outputs to make collaborative decisions. The multi-modal modules will be formulated for fast implementation on vector-based graphics processing hardware. The system will measure: proliferation, lineage (i.e., parent-daughter relationship), quiescence, and apoptotic states of each cell in culture within developing confluent populations of muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs), including immortalized pluripotent C2C12, primary mouse MDSCs, and primary human MDSCs. In Aim 2, the system will be applied to efficient discovery and characterization of cell expansion behaviors and determination of nominal culture conditions to maximize symmetry using bio-printed combinatorial arrays of immobilized growth factors on extracellular matrix substrates. In Aim 3, real-time monitoring and control of cell expansion will be demonstrated using an adaptive subculturing strategy; the predictive growth model will signal when to suspend cell culture, followed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting to exclude apoptotic or differentiating cells, thus selectively enriching subcultures for cells exhibiting the highest proliferation rates. Maintenance of differentiative potential will be monitored between subcultures using in vitro osteogenesis and myogenesis as paradigm differentiation indices.           n/a",Real-time computer vision tracking of stemness,7777326,R01EB007369,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cell division', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dactinomycin', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Daughter', 'Development', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Feedback', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Situ', 'In Vitro', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Metric', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Cells', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Muscle satellite cell', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Growth', 'Principal Investigator', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proliferating', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Video Microscopy', 'adult stem cell', 'base', 'bone', 'bone morphogenetic protein 2', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'cellular engineering', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'cytochemistry', 'detector', 'experience', 'human stem cells', 'imaging Segmentation', 'immortalized cell', 'immunocytochemistry', 'in vivo', 'in vivo regeneration', 'indexing', 'member', 'myogenesis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'osteoblast differentiation', 'osteogenic', 'osteoprogenitor cell', 'platelet-derived growth factor BB', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell division', 'stemness', 'tool', 'vector']",NIBIB,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,313747,0.10883241644213723
"Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic sequencing in nanopores shows great promise for inexpensive DNA sequencing at high speed and with minimal preparative steps. Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human SNPs or other genetic variations, which would in turn have a significant impact in pharmacogenomics and other disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome. Recently, researchers identified the inability to regulate the speed of a molecule's translocation through the pore as the primary obstacle to realizing the sequencing potential of hemolysin nanopores.      The proposed research will investigate the application of feedback control to substantially improve the ability to regulate molecule translocation speeds in a nanopore, thereby improving the ability to sequence with existing nanopore technology. In particular, the primary goal is to design novel hardware and software algorithms for feedback control of single polymers in a hemolysin nanopore on a microsecond time scale and with near angstrom precision. Such capability would contribute to the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies, augment the efforts of the $1000/mammalian genome project, and be a revolutionary contribution to the realm of applied feedback control. The control algorithms would also leverage the long-term objective of the proposed effort: the development of a nanopore-based single cell analyzer. The device would enable one to efficiently determine the concentration of all mRNA in a single cell at an instant of time. This technology would improve the ability to accurately track molecular events that occur during cell differentiation, by reducing the number of cells required for event detection and increasing the time resolution of detection measurements.        There are two primary aspects to the proposed research program that are necessary augmentations to my expertise in control. First, I will engage in a two-year intensive period of didactic training in relevant courses, including molecular and cellular biology, embryology, cell signaling, genomics and bioinformatics. The basic understanding gained is required for success in the application of control to problems in human health broadly, and in technology development for cell interrogation specifically. Second, I will participate in the $1000/mammalian genome project to learn about the physics and biology of the hemolysin nanopore.

"Predict transcriptional enhancers using epigenetic signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of eukaryotic gene transcription involves the coordination of a multitude of transcription factors and cofactors on regulatory DNA sequences such as promoters and enhancers and on the chromatin structure containing these elements. Therefore, identification of these regulatory DNA elements is of utmost importance for understanding gene regulation in both healthy and diseased cells. Previous studies have demonstrated many characteristic epigenetic modifications occur at regulatory DNA elements, e.g., high levels of histone acetylation at gene promoters and at many enhancers. In addition, it is known that many regulatory elements carry these epigenetic modifications only in specific cell/tissue types or according to environmental conditions. In recent years, a vast amount of genome-wide histone modification data has been generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip (ChIP-chip) or with next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq). Currently, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze genome-wide histone modification data in order to identify functional DNA elements.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel computational method to identify transcriptional regulatory elements on the basis of their epigenetic characteristics. In the field of machine learning, it is well established that meaningful statistical features extracted from raw data can elude more relevant information and increase the prediction accuracy of a classifier. We hypothesize that by introducing efficient data transformation and feature extraction procedures before classification, we can increase the overall prediction accuracy of our method for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. We propose to test the aforementioned hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: (1) We will adopt well-established measures from signal processing to design and test a set of statistical features that could give us a better representation of signals in histone modification data. (2) We will evaluate the performance of several commonly used statistical classifiers in predicting enhancers. We will then develop a software tool combining the most informative features from Aim 1 with the optimal classifier. (3) We will apply our computational method to predict novel enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cell and human T cell using genome-wide histone modification maps in these two cell types. We will use both computational and experimental approaches to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Although in this project we focus on enhancers, the approach we develop can be readily extended to discover other types of functional DNA elements using histone modification data in different organisms and cell types. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

"High-throughput technology for automated single cell expression analysis for C. e    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research Area: This proposal is for 06: Enabling Technologies and specific Challenge Topic HG-102 Technologies for obtaining genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from individual viable cells in complex tissues. Abstract Most existing technologies can only measure the properties of a population of cells and not the properties of individual cells. C. elegans is unique among model organisms in that the complete cell lineage is known, enabling one to identify each nucleus in an individual. We have developed an automated cell lineage analyzer capable of extracting digital, single-cell expression information from confocal images of worms expressing GFP reporters. This cell analyzer can be used to extract expression data in a semi-high throughput manner. As proof-of-principle, we generated expression profiles of 93 genes in 363 specific cells from L1 stage larvae, and were able to quantitatively analyze expression of each gene as well as the molecular expression signature for each cell. This proposal is to first develop a generalized method to automatically annotate nuclei from confocal images, by assigning them a specific name from the cell lineage. We will then use the automated cell lineage analyzer in a data pipeline to analyze images from 1000 genes at six different developmental stages in 8000 confocal images. By generating a single cell expression database over the next two years, we will create a rich, new source of data for many years to come. Currently, images of worms in confocal data stacks can only be browsed manually, one gene at a time. Our database will convert images to quantitative expression values in an expression table that is suitable for computational analysis. Single cell expression analysis is a conceptually new way to study development and aging in C. elegans, using quantitative molecular signatures rather than cellular morphology. For instance, we can use the molecular signatures to determine how many different cell types are formed out of the total 959 cells in the lineage, to determine when and where during development cells begin to express different sets of genes, and to look for the way in which molecular fates are repeated in the cell lineage in order to extract the underlying regulatory modules that guide developmental pattern. This digital, single-cell expression database will be unique because C. elegans is the only model organism in which we can map the identities of individual nuclei and to our knowledge, we are the only group with a cell lineage annotator capable of extracting single cell expression information from larvae and adults.            Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Kim, Stuart K.

"Integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in multiple cell types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics, and specific Challenge Topic, 08-OD-101, Computational approaches for epigenomic analysis. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence. These epigenetic modifications lead to the diversity of function across different human cell types, and play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during development, and also in health and disease. The human ENCODE project, the NIH Epigenome Roadmap, and several other large-scale experimental efforts are currently underway to map dozens of histone and DNA modifications across multiple human cell types and disease states, generating a diversity of rich epigenomic datasets. This creates a pressing need for the development of rigorous computational methods for the systematic integrative analysis of epigenomic datasets, and for understanding their relationship to other genomic datasets, including gene expression, disease association, and phenotypic profiling. In this proposal, we will develop and apply graphical probabilistic models for describing chromatin modifications, based on multivariate hidden Markov models. We will use these models to discover the set of underlying chromatin state, based on recurrent combinations of epigenetic marks across the entire genome (Aim 1). We will validate and functionally characterize these states based on their enrichments and positional biases with respect to existing functional elements, as well as large-scale gene expression and disease association datasets (Aim 2). Lastly, we will extend these methods to study dynamics of chromatin state across both healthy and disease cell types, and study how these correlate with functional differences between the observed cell types (Aim 3). We will work closely with the scientists involved in data production and facilitate communication and data integration across them, and also with data analysis and coordination centers already established to facilitate sharing of methods and results across the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap consortia, and with the larger community. Overall, the proposed integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets will provide a unified view of current and planned epigenomic datasets, towards a systematic understanding of gene and genome regulation in health and disease. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence, leading to the diversity of function across different human cell types. This project will create a computational framework and resource to integrate large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets, to understand their functional role in health and disease, and to understand their dynamics across different cell lines and disease states.

"Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is a Fast-Track application to provide reliable, cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in cancer biopsies to assist pharmaceutical drug development and provision of patient-specific prognosis and therapy guidance (""personalized medicine""). The organizing theme is that the appropriate unit of analysis should be the individual cell as opposed to averaged tumor extracts. To this end, novel technologies will be coupled with careful methods-development. Spectral imaging and advanced image analysis tools will permit multi-target immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or immunofluorescence (IF) detection, at the cellular and subcellular level in intact tissue sections. CRi-developed image processing and machine-learning tools provide automation and sophisticated quantitation options. Multiplexed staining protocols will yield independent, potentially stoichiometric labeling with combined IHC and IF. The sensitivity of all potential markers to variations in tissue handling will be carefully assessed; some may be robust and suitable for archival tissue studies, others will be too labile. Ultrasound-assisted fixation will be tested for its ability to preserve such labile epitopes for use in prospectively acquired tissues. Four or more pathway-related proteins will be detected in tissue sections, on a cell-by-cell basis, even if co-localized and with spectrally overlapping labels. The coordinated subcellular location of the pathway molecules will be also tracked, with simultaneous assessment of cell-surface receptors (e.g., EGFR, VEGF, Her2-neu), downstream signaling proteins and phosphoproteins (e.g., pAKT, pERK), nuclear proteins (e.g., ER, Ki67), and novel players such as protein-folding mediators (e.g. BIP1).       The project will combine optimized tissue protocols, multiplexed IHC/IF reagent kits, and unique machine- learning image analysis that can be used to automate region-detection and label-quantitation. All these depend on CRi's multispectral imaging approaches for assessing multiple analytes on a cell-by-cell and cell- compartment basis in tissue sections. Our collaborators will provide small-animal tumor models for early methods development, multiplexed immunohistochemical labeling of pathway proteins in clinical cancer biopsies, access to archived and prospectively acquired tissues from pathway-targeting clinical drug trials, highly informative archival tissue microarrays, access to validated, activation-specific antibodies, ultra-fast tissue fixation, and biostatistics support. The ""deliverable"" will be a suite of products suitable for clinical use that can provide much-needed valid information on single-cell-based pathway status in an intact tissue context to support pharmaceutical drug development efforts and provide molecularly focused patient care.       Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine, which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific patients. Conventional molecular pathology methods are typically limited to a single immunohistochemical (IHC) test on a given tissue section or to expensive and time-consuming proteomics or expression-array approaches (which cannot directly report out pathway activation status in cancer cell populations and subpopulations). Multiplexed IHC (including immuno-fluorescence) combined with optimized sample handling protocols to retain pathway proteins and advanced image analysis will enable the unambiguous detection of active signaling pathways, benefiting pharmaceutical research in the selection of patients for better targeted trials and in the monitoring of response, and clinical practice for diagnosis, therapy selection, and monitoring response (i.e., theranostics).          n/a",Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging,7767720,R44CA130026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Avastin', 'BAY 54-9085', 'BIK gene', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'British Columbia', 'CD34 gene', 'Calibration', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Correlative Study', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'Employment', 'Energy Transfer', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Fixatives', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Nuclear Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Reagent', 'Receptor Activation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roche brand of trastuzumab', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transillumination', 'Translating', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Weight', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'clinical material', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lapatinib', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'member', 'method development', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'nanoparticle', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'protein folding', 'research study', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'statistics', 'subcutaneous', 'tissue culture', 'tissue processing', 'tissue/cell culture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R44,2010,913767,0.03425364700441769
"A Cell Phone-based Sign Reader for Blind & Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop and evaluate a cell-phone-based system to enable blind and visually impaired individuals to find and read street signs and other signs relevant to wayfinding. Using the built-in camera and computing power of a standard cell phone, the system will process images captured by the user to find and analyze signs, and speak their contents. This will provide valuable assistance for blind or visually impaired pedestrians in finding and reading street signs, as well as locating and identifying addresses and store names, without requiring them to carry any special-purpose hardware. The sign finding and reading software will be made freely available for download into any camera-equipped cell phone that uses the widespread Symbian operating system (such as the popular Nokia cell phone series). We will build on our prior and ongoing work in applying computer vision techniques to practical problem-solving for blind persons, including cell-phone implementation of algorithms for indoor wayfinding and for reading digital appliance displays. We will develop, refine and transfer to the cell phone platform a new belief propagation-based algorithm that has shown preliminary success in finding and analyzing signs under difficult real-world conditions including partial shadow coverage. Human factors studies will help determine how to configure the system and its user controls for maximum effectiveness and ease of use, and provide an evaluation of the overall system. Access to environmental labels, signs or landmarks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task. The proposed research would result in a highly accessible system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to augment existing wayfinding techniques, which could dramatically improve independent travel for blind and visually impaired persons.          n/a",A Cell Phone-based Sign Reader for Blind & Visually Impaired Persons,7911722,R01EY018210,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Belief', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Figs - dietary', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Left', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Modification', 'Names', 'Operating System', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'legally blind', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'way finding', 'web site']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2010,423145,0.04297919388720234
"Computational Modeling of Cell Migration in 3D Matrices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to construct and test predictive computational models for how diverse intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments. Our technical approach comprises several features in innovative combination: {1} 3D quantitative tracking of individual cell migration parameters within relevant biomacromolecular matrices; {2} quantitative biochemical measurements of key intracellular signals during this 3D migration; {3} modulation of these signals by genetic manipulation of receptor properties and by pharmacological inhibition of key molecular switches; {4} computational modeling of the quantitative relationship of these signals to the consequent migration response; and {5} experimental test of non-intuitive model predictions. We focus on signals and responses induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) cues. Signals generated downstream of ErbB family receptor ligand binding strongly influence migration response behavior of many cell types, including carcinoma cells during tumor progression to invasion and metastasis. This paradigmatic ""cue-signal- response"" system is important physiologically during organogenesis and tissue regeneration, and when aberrant enables the pathology of tumor invasion and dissemination. Thus, understanding how the signaling control is exerted quantitatively should have broadly relevant and useful implications for both basic science and therapeutic applications. Although a multitude of individual components in the ErbB signaling network have been identified, quantitative models integratively relating these divergent signaling pathways to migration response behavior are only now emerging. Very little fundamental work on signaling governing migration has been performed in 3D environments that truly represent the barriers to tumor invasion and dissemination. Our work intimately integrates computational modeling with dedicated quantitative experimental measurement of ErbB family-induced cell migration and signaling network activity within 3D matrices. Our modeling approach will focus not on the more commonly-pursued ""cue-signal"" facet (that of signal generation from ligand/receptor cues, but instead the sorely under-addressed ""signal-response"" facet. Although it is clear that multiple signaling pathways downstream of ErbB receptors can play significant roles in regulating migration, what is not understood is how multi-pathway networks quantitatively integrate to yield the observed phenotypic behavior. This question will be addressed using the statistical modeling framework known as Decision Tree analysis, which defines a control hierarchy relating logical combinations of signals to the migration behavioral response across all cue conditions. Our goal for the proposed grant is to apply decision tree modeling to prediction of effects of ErbB receptor signaling on epithelial and carcinoma cell migration through three-dimensional matrices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our goal is to construct and test predictive computational models for how intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments. We focus on signals and responses induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) cues, with relevance to tissue regeneration and tumor invasiveness.

"BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated. Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06). In vivo studies will use a preclinical heterotopic bone implantation model to examine the in vivo bone forming capacity of hMSC. Mathematical modeling will be used to describe kinetics of BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation, and Bayesian learning will be used to discover signaling networks that are unique to BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation. The completion of this five-year project will not only demonstrate the utility of BMP6 therapeutically to control hMSC osteoblast differentiation, but will also reveal novel signaling and transcriptional networks that govern hMC osteoblast differentiation. Long term, the identity of novel targets will lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic options for directing hMSC differentiation in tissue engineered constructs to repair bone.           n/a",BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation,7799797,R01DE017471,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autologous', 'BMP2 gene', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen Type I', 'Collagraft', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Marrow', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor Activation', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Development', 'Stem cells', 'Stimulus', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'UC06', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial repair', 'dosage', 'drug discovery', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'long bone', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'osteoblast differentiation', 'osteogenic', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2010,317080,0.052947274765905376
"Morphomic Analysis of a Simple Chordate The original application proposed a comprehensive characterization of morphogenesis in both wild type and experimentally manipulated embryos. Emphasis was to be placed on characterizing morphogenesis in both the notochord and the central nervous system. We also proposed to image experimentally manipulated embryos in which key embryogenesis genes were knocked down. In this revised two-year study we will restrict our efforts to the developing notochord in wild-type embryos. Our goal in focusing on the notochord is to establish the methodologies for image capture, segmentation and analysis that will be of broadest potential use to us, and others. In collecting the embryo images for this analysis we will be capturing the embryos in toto and in high resolution. Thus, while we will be focusing on the notochord, the image sets will be amenable to the analysis of other tissues in future studies. The notochord will serve as an ideal model for developing these methods. Besides the universal importance of the notochord for chordate development, the ascidian notochord presents a range of challenges for computer segmentation and analysis, yet it is probably the most tractable tissues in the embryo because of the low and fixed numbers of cells, and the fact that once cell intercalation is completed, the overall arrangement of the cells does not change. In the Preliminary Results section we demonstrated 3D time-lapse imaging of live embryos by both DIC and fluorescence microscopy. In this revised proposal we will continue with both of these imaging methods. As in the original proposal, several approaches for notochord cell segmentation will be pursued and optimized. We have presented preliminary results with two very different approaches for cell boundary detection: network snakes for DIC images; and a watershed-based method for confocal images of live embryos stained with a fluorescent membrane dye. We expect that concentrating on the notochord will allow us to make substantial contributions in only two years while building tools that can later be extended to more challenging tissues. Finally, we will develop tools for the morphometric analysis and visualization of the notochord data.  Organs and tissues are built during embryogenesis through the precise interactions of a myriad of cells and cell types. Advances in tissue repair and engineering will require that the rules and mechanisms that govern how cells come together to form organs and tissues be elucidated.

"Real-time computer vision tracking of stemness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the need for new stem cell engineering toolsets that can regulate adult stem cell expansion (self-renewal, without differentiation) ex vivo in order to create sufficient numbers of cells for clinical applications. The goals of this proposal are to: 1) develop a computer vision system that tracks in real-time the spatiotemporal histories of cell divisions in vitro in phase-contrast imagery; 2) use this data to automatically derive real-time metrics of symmetry, division times, confluence, and predictive population growth models; and, 3) apply this system to develop novel strategies that maximize the yield of adult stem cell expansion in growth factor-mediated conditions. 'Real-time' means that processing is completed 'on-line' in the 15 minute intervals between image acquisitions, and this information is available during cell culture as feedback for process monitoring and control. In Aim 1, robust image segmentation and tracking of dense cell populations will be achieved using multi-modal cell tracking modules that represent and reason about cell states and motion from different perspectives, and then fuse and coordinate their respective outputs to make collaborative decisions. The multi-modal modules will be formulated for fast implementation on vector-based graphics processing hardware. The system will measure: proliferation, lineage (i.e., parent-daughter relationship), quiescence, and apoptotic states of each cell in culture within developing confluent populations of muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs), including immortalized pluripotent C2C12, primary mouse MDSCs, and primary human MDSCs. In Aim 2, the system will be applied to efficient discovery and characterization of cell expansion behaviors and determination of nominal culture conditions to maximize symmetry using bio-printed combinatorial arrays of immobilized growth factors on extracellular matrix substrates. In Aim 3, real-time monitoring and control of cell expansion will be demonstrated using an adaptive subculturing strategy; the predictive growth model will signal when to suspend cell culture, followed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting to exclude apoptotic or differentiating cells, thus selectively enriching subcultures for cells exhibiting the highest proliferation rates.

"Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic sequencing in nanopores shows great promise for inexpensive DNA sequencing at high speed and with minimal preparative steps. Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human SNPs or other genetic variations, which would in turn have a significant impact in pharmacogenomics and other disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome. Recently, researchers identified the inability to regulate the speed of a molecule's translocation through the pore as the primary obstacle to realizing the sequencing potential of hemolysin nanopores.      The proposed research will investigate the application of feedback control to substantially improve the ability to regulate molecule translocation speeds in a nanopore, thereby improving the ability to sequence with existing nanopore technology. In particular, the primary goal is to design novel hardware and software algorithms for feedback control of single polymers in a hemolysin nanopore on a microsecond time scale and with near angstrom precision. Such capability would contribute to the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies, augment the efforts of the $1000/mammalian genome project, and be a revolutionary contribution to the realm of applied feedback control. The control algorithms would also leverage the long-term objective of the proposed effort: the development of a nanopore-based single cell analyzer. The device would enable one to efficiently determine the concentration of all mRNA in a single cell at an instant of time. This technology would improve the ability to accurately track molecular events that occur during cell differentiation, by reducing the number of cells required for event detection and increasing the time resolution of detection measurements.        There are two primary aspects to the proposed research program that are necessary augmentations to my expertise in control. First, I will engage in a two-year intensive period of didactic training in relevant courses, including molecular and cellular biology, embryology, cell signaling, genomics and bioinformatics. The basic understanding gained is required for success in the application of control to problems in human health broadly, and in technology development for cell interrogation specifically. Second, I will participate in the $1000/mammalian genome project to learn about the physics and biology of the hemolysin nanopore. In parallel to the $1000 genome project, I will explore the controlled capabilities of the nanopore for efficient mRNA sequencing, using tools from bioinformatics and machine learning to translate the controlled response data into the identity of unknown nucleotides.          n/a",Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore,7687632,K25HG004035,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Embryology', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemolysin', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Physics', 'Poly C', 'Poly U', 'Polymers', 'RNA', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uracil', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'base', 'cell analyzer', 'copolymer', 'design', 'improved', 'laptop', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'single molecule', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,K25,2009,165961,0.0499837382177984

We have developed an automated cell lineage analyzer capable of extracting digital, single-cell expression information from confocal images of worms expressing GFP reporters. This cell analyzer can be used to extract expression data in a semi-high throughput manner. As proof-of-principle, we generated expression profiles of 93 genes in 363 specific cells from L1 stage larvae, and were able to quantitatively analyze expression of each gene as well as the molecular expression signature for each cell. This proposal is to first develop a generalized method to automatically annotate nuclei from confocal images, by assigning them a specific name from the cell lineage. We will then use the automated cell lineage analyzer in a data pipeline to analyze images from 1000 genes at six different developmental stages in 8000 confocal images. By generating a single cell expression database over the next two years, we will create a rich, new source of data for many years to come. Currently, images of worms in confocal data stacks can only be browsed manually, one gene at a time. Our database will convert images to quantitative expression values in an expression table that is suitable for computational analysis. Single cell expression analysis is a conceptually new way to study development and aging in C. elegans, using quantitative molecular signatures rather than cellular morphology. For instance, we can use the molecular signatures to determine how many different cell types are formed out of the total 959 cells in the lineage, to determine when and where during development cells begin to express different sets of genes, and to look for the way in which molecular fates are repeated in the cell lineage in order to extract the underlying regulatory modules that guide developmental pattern. This digital, single-cell expression database will be unique because C. elegans is the only model organism in which we can map the identities of individual nuclei and to our knowledge, we are the only group with a cell lineage annotator capable of extracting single cell expression information from larvae and adults.            Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Kim, Stuart K.

"Integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in multiple cell types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics, and specific Challenge Topic, 08-OD-101, Computational approaches for epigenomic analysis. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence. These epigenetic modifications lead to the diversity of function across different human cell types, and play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during development, and also in health and disease. The human ENCODE project, the NIH Epigenome Roadmap, and several other large-scale experimental efforts are currently underway to map dozens of histone and DNA modifications across multiple human cell types and disease states, generating a diversity of rich epigenomic datasets. This creates a pressing need for the development of rigorous computational methods for the systematic integrative analysis of epigenomic datasets, and for understanding their relationship to other genomic datasets, including gene expression, disease association, and phenotypic profiling. In this proposal, we will develop and apply graphical probabilistic models for describing chromatin modifications, based on multivariate hidden Markov models. We will use these models to discover the set of underlying chromatin state, based on recurrent combinations of epigenetic marks across the entire genome (Aim 1). We will validate and functionally characterize these states based on their enrichments and positional biases with respect to existing functional elements, as well as large-scale gene expression and disease association datasets (Aim 2). Lastly, we will extend these methods to study dynamics of chromatin state across both healthy and disease cell types, and study how these correlate with functional differences between the observed cell types (Aim 3). We will work closely with the scientists involved in data production and facilitate communication and data integration across them, and also with data analysis and coordination centers already established to facilitate sharing of methods and results across the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap consortia, and with the larger community. Overall, the proposed integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets will provide a unified view of current and planned epigenomic datasets, towards a systematic understanding of gene and genome regulation in health and disease. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence, leading to the diversity of function across different human cell types. This project will create a computational framework and resource to integrate large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets, to understand their functional role in health and disease, and to understand their dynamics across different cell lines and disease states. The knowledge gained can play key roles in understanding the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during healthy development, and how dysregulation of these processes can lead to the onset of disease.               Narrative: While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence, leading to the diversity of function across different human cell types.

"Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is a Fast-Track application to provide reliable, cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in cancer biopsies to assist pharmaceutical drug development and provision of patient-specific prognosis and therapy guidance (""personalized medicine""). The organizing theme is that the appropriate unit of analysis should be the individual cell as opposed to averaged tumor extracts. To this end, novel technologies will be coupled with careful methods-development. Spectral imaging and advanced image analysis tools will permit multi-target immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or immunofluorescence (IF) detection, at the cellular and subcellular level in intact tissue sections. CRi-developed image processing and machine-learning tools provide automation and sophisticated quantitation options. Multiplexed staining protocols will yield independent, potentially stoichiometric labeling with combined IHC and IF. The sensitivity of all potential markers to variations in tissue handling will be carefully assessed; some may be robust and suitable for archival tissue studies, others will be too labile. Ultrasound-assisted fixation will be tested for its ability to preserve such labile epitopes for use in prospectively acquired tissues. Four or more pathway-related proteins will be detected in tissue sections, on a cell-by-cell basis, even if co-localized and with spectrally overlapping labels. The coordinated subcellular location of the pathway molecules will be also tracked, with simultaneous assessment of cell-surface receptors (e.g., EGFR, VEGF, Her2-neu), downstream signaling proteins and phosphoproteins (e.g., pAKT, pERK), nuclear proteins (e.g., ER, Ki67), and novel players such as protein-folding mediators (e.g. BIP1).       The project will combine optimized tissue protocols, multiplexed IHC/IF reagent kits, and unique machine- learning image analysis that can be used to automate region-detection and label-quantitation. All these depend on CRi's multispectral imaging approaches for assessing multiple analytes on a cell-by-cell and cell- compartment basis in tissue sections. Our collaborators will provide small-animal tumor models for early methods development, multiplexed immunohistochemical labeling of pathway proteins in clinical cancer biopsies, access to archived and prospectively acquired tissues from pathway-targeting clinical drug trials, highly informative archival tissue microarrays, access to validated, activation-specific antibodies, ultra-fast tissue fixation, and biostatistics support. The ""deliverable"" will be a suite of products suitable for clinical use that can provide much-needed valid information on single-cell-based pathway status in an intact tissue context to support pharmaceutical drug development efforts and provide molecularly focused patient care.       Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine, which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific patients. Conventional molecular pathology methods are typically limited to a single immunohistochemical (IHC) test on a given tissue section or to expensive and time-consuming proteomics or expression-array approaches (which cannot directly report out pathway activation status in cancer cell populations and subpopulations). Multiplexed IHC (including immuno-fluorescence) combined with optimized sample handling protocols to retain pathway proteins and advanced image analysis will enable the unambiguous detection of active signaling pathways, benefiting pharmaceutical research in the selection of patients for better targeted trials and in the monitoring of response, and clinical practice for diagnosis, therapy selection, and monitoring response (i.e., theranostics).          Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple  molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of  clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine,  which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific  patients.

"A Cell Phone-based Sign Reader for Blind & Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop and evaluate a cell-phone-based system to enable blind and visually impaired individuals to find and read street signs and other signs relevant to wayfinding. Using the built-in camera and computing power of a standard cell phone, the system will process images captured by the user to find and analyze signs, and speak their contents. This will provide valuable assistance for blind or visually impaired pedestrians in finding and reading street signs, as well as locating and identifying addresses and store names, without requiring them to carry any special-purpose hardware. The sign finding and reading software will be made freely available for download into any camera-equipped cell phone that uses the widespread Symbian operating system (such as the popular Nokia cell phone series). We will build on our prior and ongoing work in applying computer vision techniques to practical problem-solving for blind persons, including cell-phone implementation of algorithms for indoor wayfinding and for reading digital appliance displays. We will develop, refine and transfer to the cell phone platform a new belief propagation-based algorithm that has shown preliminary success in finding and analyzing signs under difficult real-world conditions including partial shadow coverage. Human factors studies will help determine how to configure the system and its user controls for maximum effectiveness and ease of use, and provide an evaluation of the overall system. Access to environmental labels, signs or landmarks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task.

"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impared Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urban intersections are the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard camera cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Drawing on our recent work on computer vision algorithms that help a blind person find crosswalks and other important features in a street intersection, as well as our ongoing work on cell phone implementations of algorithms for indoor wayfinding and for reading digital appliance displays, we will refine these algorithms and implement them on a cell phone. The information extracted by the algorithms will be communicated to the user with a combination of synthesized speech, audio tones and/or tactile feedback (using the cell phone's built-in vibrator). Human factors studies will help determine how to configure the system and its user controls for maximum effectiveness and ease of use, and provide an evaluation of the overall system. The street intersection analysis software will be made freely available for download into any camera-equipped cell phone that uses the widespread Symbian operating system (such as the popular Nokia cell phone series). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software. Ultimately a user will be able to download an entire suite of such algorithms for free onto the cell phone he or she is already likely to be carrying, without having to carry a separate piece of equipment for each function.

"Computational Modeling of Cell Migration in 3D Matrices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to construct and test predictive computational models for how diverse intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments. Our technical approach comprises several features in innovative combination: {1} 3D quantitative tracking of individual cell migration parameters within relevant biomacromolecular matrices; {2} quantitative biochemical measurements of key intracellular signals during this 3D migration; {3} modulation of these signals by genetic manipulation of receptor properties and by pharmacological inhibition of key molecular switches; {4} computational modeling of the quantitative relationship of these signals to the consequent migration response; and {5} experimental test of non-intuitive model predictions. We focus on signals and responses induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) cues. Signals generated downstream of ErbB family receptor ligand binding strongly influence migration response behavior of many cell types, including carcinoma cells during tumor progression to invasion and metastasis. This paradigmatic ""cue-signal- response"" system is important physiologically during organogenesis and tissue regeneration, and when aberrant enables the pathology of tumor invasion and dissemination. Thus, understanding how the signaling control is exerted quantitatively should have broadly relevant and useful implications for both basic science and therapeutic applications. Although a multitude of individual components in the ErbB signaling network have been identified, quantitative models integratively relating these divergent signaling pathways to migration response behavior are only now emerging. Very little fundamental work on signaling governing migration has been performed in 3D environments that truly represent the barriers to tumor invasion and dissemination. Our work intimately integrates computational modeling with dedicated quantitative experimental measurement of ErbB family-induced cell migration and signaling network activity within 3D matrices. Our modeling approach will focus not on the more commonly-pursued ""cue-signal"" facet (that of signal generation from ligand/receptor cues, but instead the sorely under-addressed ""signal-response"" facet. Although it is clear that multiple signaling pathways downstream of ErbB receptors can play significant roles in regulating migration, what is not understood is how multi-pathway networks quantitatively integrate to yield the observed phenotypic behavior. This question will be addressed using the statistical modeling framework known as Decision Tree analysis, which defines a control hierarchy relating logical combinations of signals to the migration behavioral response across all cue conditions. Our goal for the proposed grant is to apply decision tree modeling to prediction of effects of ErbB receptor signaling on epithelial and carcinoma cell migration through three-dimensional matrices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our goal is to construct and test predictive computational models for how intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments. We focus on signals and responses induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) cues, with relevance to tissue regeneration and tumor invasiveness.

"BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated. Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06). In vivo studies will use a preclinical heterotopic bone implantation model to examine the in vivo bone forming capacity of hMSC. Mathematical modeling will be used to describe kinetics of BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation, and Bayesian learning will be used to discover signaling networks that are unique to BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation. The completion of this five-year project will not only demonstrate the utility of BMP6 therapeutically to control hMSC osteoblast differentiation, but will also reveal novel signaling and transcriptional networks that govern hMC osteoblast differentiation. Long term, the identity of novel targets will lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic options for directing hMSC differentiation in tissue engineered constructs to repair bone.           n/a",BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation,7878908,R01DE017471,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autologous', 'BMP2 gene', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen Type I', 'Collagraft', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Marrow', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor Activation', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Development', 'Stem cells', 'Stimulus', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'UC06', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial repair', 'dosage', 'drug discovery', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'long bone', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'osteoblast differentiation', 'osteogenic', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2009,88138,0.052947274765905376

"Morphomic Analysis of a Simple Chordate The original application proposed a comprehensive characterization of morphogenesis in both wild type and experimentally manipulated embryos. Emphasis was to be placed on characterizing morphogenesis in both the notochord and the central nervous system. We also proposed to image experimentally manipulated embryos in which key embryogenesis genes were knocked down. In this revised two-year study we will restrict our efforts to the developing notochord in wild-type embryos. Our goal in focusing on the notochord is to establish the methodologies for image capture, segmentation and analysis that will be of broadest potential use to us, and others. In collecting the embryo images for this analysis we will be capturing the embryos in toto and in high resolution. Thus, while we will be focusing on the notochord, the image sets will be amenable to the analysis of other tissues in future studies. The notochord will serve as an ideal model for developing these methods. Besides the universal importance of the notochord for chordate development, the ascidian notochord presents a range of challenges for computer segmentation and analysis, yet it is probably the most tractable tissues in the embryo because of the low and fixed numbers of cells, and the fact that once cell intercalation is completed, the overall arrangement of the cells does not change. In the Preliminary Results section we demonstrated 3D time-lapse imaging of live embryos by both DIC and fluorescence microscopy. In this revised proposal we will continue with both of these imaging methods. As in the original proposal, several approaches for notochord cell segmentation will be pursued and optimized. We have presented preliminary results with two very different approaches for cell boundary detection: network snakes for DIC images; and a watershed-based method for confocal images of live embryos stained with a fluorescent membrane dye. We expect that concentrating on the notochord will allow us to make substantial contributions in only two years while building tools that can later be extended to more challenging tissues. Finally, we will develop tools for the morphometric analysis and visualization of the notochord data. Organs and tissues are built during embryogenesis through the precise interactions of a myriad of cells and cell types. Advances in tissue repair and engineering will require that the rules and mechanisms that govern how cells come together to form organs and tissues be elucidated. The project proposed here will combine the efforts of developmental biologists and computer engineers to capture and analyze images from live embryos with the goal of understanding cell behaviors in forming organs.",Morphomic Analysis of a Simple Chordate,7677473,R01HD059217,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell Size', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dyes', 'Economics', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and Supplies', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphogenesis', 'Movement', 'Neuraxis', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Snakes', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Students', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Visualization software', 'Wound Healing', 'ascidian', 'base', 'blastomere structure', 'career', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'economic impact', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'intercalation', 'knock-down', 'multidisciplinary', 'notochord', 'post-doctoral training', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell biology', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2009,397786,0.041326130746317614
"Real-time computer vision tracking of stemness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the need for new stem cell engineering toolsets that can regulate adult stem cell expansion (self-renewal, without differentiation) ex vivo in order to create sufficient numbers of cells for clinical applications. The goals of this proposal are to: 1) develop a computer vision system that tracks in real-time the spatiotemporal histories of cell divisions in vitro in phase-contrast imagery; 2) use this data to automatically derive real-time metrics of symmetry, division times, confluence, and predictive population growth models; and, 3) apply this system to develop novel strategies that maximize the yield of adult stem cell expansion in growth factor-mediated conditions. 'Real-time' means that processing is completed 'on-line' in the 15 minute intervals between image acquisitions, and this information is available during cell culture as feedback for process monitoring and control. In Aim 1, robust image segmentation and tracking of dense cell populations will be achieved using multi-modal cell tracking modules that represent and reason about cell states and motion from different perspectives, and then fuse and coordinate their respective outputs to make collaborative decisions. The multi-modal modules will be formulated for fast implementation on vector-based graphics processing hardware. The system will measure: proliferation, lineage (i.e., parent-daughter relationship), quiescence, and apoptotic states of each cell in culture within developing confluent populations of muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs), including immortalized pluripotent C2C12, primary mouse MDSCs, and primary human MDSCs. In Aim 2, the system will be applied to efficient discovery and characterization of cell expansion behaviors and determination of nominal culture conditions to maximize symmetry using bio-printed combinatorial arrays of immobilized growth factors on extracellular matrix substrates. In Aim 3, real-time monitoring and control of cell expansion will be demonstrated using an adaptive subculturing strategy; the predictive growth model will signal when to suspend cell culture, followed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting to exclude apoptotic or differentiating cells, thus selectively enriching subcultures for cells exhibiting the highest proliferation rates. Maintenance of differentiative potential will be monitored between subcultures using in vitro osteogenesis and myogenesis as paradigm differentiation indices.           n/a",Real-time computer vision tracking of stemness,7413724,R01EB007369,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell division', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Cultured Cells', 'Dactinomycin', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Daughter', 'Development', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Feedback', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Situ', 'In Vitro', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Metric', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Cells', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Muscle satellite cell', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Growth', 'Principal Investigator', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proliferating', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Video Microscopy', 'adult stem cell', 'base', 'bone', 'bone morphogenetic protein 2', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'cellular engineering', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'cytochemistry', 'desire', 'detector', 'experience', 'human stem cells', 'imaging Segmentation', 'immortalized cell', 'immunocytochemistry', 'in vivo', 'in vivo regeneration', 'indexing', 'member', 'myogenesis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'platelet-derived growth factor BB', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'spatiotemporal', 'stemness', 'tool', 'vector']",NIBIB,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,316913,0.10883241644213723
"Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic sequencing in nanopores shows great promise for inexpensive DNA sequencing at high speed and with minimal preparative steps. Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human SNPs or other genetic variations, which would in turn have a significant impact in pharmacogenomics and other disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome. Recently, researchers identified the inability to regulate the speed of a molecule's translocation through the pore as the primary obstacle to realizing the sequencing potential of hemolysin nanopores.      The proposed research will investigate the application of feedback control to substantially improve the ability to regulate molecule translocation speeds in a nanopore, thereby improving the ability to sequence with existing nanopore technology. In particular, the primary goal is to design novel hardware and software algorithms for feedback control of single polymers in a hemolysin nanopore on a microsecond time scale and with near angstrom precision. Such capability would contribute to the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies, augment the efforts of the $1000/mammalian genome project, and be a revolutionary contribution to the realm of applied feedback control. The control algorithms would also leverage the long-term objective of the proposed effort: the development of a nanopore-based single cell analyzer. The device would enable one to efficiently determine the concentration of all mRNA in a single cell at an instant of time. This technology would improve the ability to accurately track molecular events that occur during cell differentiation, by reducing the number of cells required for event detection and increasing the time resolution of detection measurements.        There are two primary aspects to the proposed research program that are necessary augmentations to my expertise in control.

"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impared Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urban intersections are the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard camera cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Drawing on our recent work on computer vision algorithms that help a blind person find crosswalks and other important features in a street intersection, as well as our ongoing work on cell phone implementations of algorithms for indoor wayfinding and for reading digital appliance displays, we will refine these algorithms and implement them on a cell phone. The information extracted by the algorithms will be communicated to the user with a combination of synthesized speech, audio tones and/or tactile feedback (using the cell phone's built-in vibrator). Human factors studies will help determine how to configure the system and its user controls for maximum effectiveness and ease of use, and provide an evaluation of the overall system. The street intersection analysis software will be made freely available for download into any camera-equipped cell phone that uses the widespread Symbian operating system (such as the popular Nokia cell phone series). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software. Ultimately a user will be able to download an entire suite of such algorithms for free onto the cell phone he or she is already likely to be carrying, without having to carry a separate piece of equipment for each function. Relevance: The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task. The proposed research would result in a highly accessible system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to augment existing wayfinding techniques, which could dramatically improve independent travel for blind and visually impaired persons.           n/a",A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impared Pedestrians,7490458,R01EY018345,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Figs - dietary', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Left', 'Light', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Modification', 'Operating System', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Zebra', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'day', 'digital', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'legally blind', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'skills', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'way finding']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2008,335542,0.07012299604666453
"Computational Modeling of Cell Migration in 3D Matrices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to construct and test predictive computational models for how diverse intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments. Our technical approach comprises several features in innovative combination: {1} 3D quantitative tracking of individual cell migration parameters within relevant biomacromolecular matrices; {2} quantitative biochemical measurements of key intracellular signals during this 3D migration; {3} modulation of these signals by genetic manipulation of receptor properties and by pharmacological inhibition of key molecular switches; {4} computational modeling of the quantitative relationship of these signals to the consequent migration response; and {5} experimental test of non-intuitive model predictions. We focus on signals and responses induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) cues. Signals generated downstream of ErbB family receptor ligand binding strongly influence migration response behavior of many cell types, including carcinoma cells during tumor progression to invasion and metastasis. This paradigmatic ""cue-signal- response"" system is important physiologically during organogenesis and tissue regeneration, and when aberrant enables the pathology of tumor invasion and dissemination. Thus, understanding how the signaling control is exerted quantitatively should have broadly relevant and useful implications for both basic science and therapeutic applications. Although a multitude of individual components in the ErbB signaling network have been identified, quantitative models integratively relating these divergent signaling pathways to migration response behavior are only now emerging. Very little fundamental work on signaling governing migration has been performed in 3D environments that truly represent the barriers to tumor invasion and dissemination. Our work intimately integrates computational modeling with dedicated quantitative experimental measurement of ErbB family-induced cell migration and signaling network activity within 3D matrices. Our modeling approach will focus not on the more commonly-pursued ""cue-signal"" facet (that of signal generation from ligand/receptor cues, but instead the sorely under-addressed ""signal-response"" facet. Although it is clear that multiple signaling pathways downstream of ErbB receptors can play significant roles in regulating migration, what is not understood is how multi-pathway networks quantitatively integrate to yield the observed phenotypic behavior. This question will be addressed using the statistical modeling framework known as Decision Tree analysis, which defines a control hierarchy relating logical combinations of signals to the migration behavioral response across all cue conditions. Our goal for the proposed grant is to apply decision tree modeling to prediction of effects of ErbB receptor signaling on epithelial and carcinoma cell migration through three-dimensional matrices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our goal is to construct and test predictive computational models for how intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments. We focus on signals and responses induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) cues, with relevance to tissue regeneration and tumor invasiveness.

"BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated. Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06).

First, I will engage in a two-year intensive period of didactic training in relevant courses, including molecular and cellular biology, embryology, cell signaling, genomics and bioinformatics. The basic understanding gained is required for success in the application of control to problems in human health broadly, and in technology development for cell interrogation specifically. Second, I will participate in the $1000/mammalian genome project to learn about the physics and biology of the hemolysin nanopore. In parallel to the $1000 genome project, I will explore the controlled capabilities of the nanopore for efficient mRNA sequencing, using tools from bioinformatics and machine learning to translate the controlled response data into the identity of unknown nucleotides.          n/a",Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore,7281328,K25HG004035,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Embryology', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemolysin', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Physics', 'Poly C', 'Poly U', 'Polymers', 'RNA', 'Rate', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uracil', 'Vision', 'base', 'cell analyzer', 'copolymer', 'design', 'desire', 'improved', 'laptop', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'single molecule', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,K25,2007,128462,0.0499837382177984
"Centrosomin and Centrosomes in Cell Division DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The equal distribution of chromosomes into daughter cells depends upon the accurate assembly of the mitotic spindle at cell division. The inappropriate segregation of chromosomes leads to aneuploidy, which can result in cell death or carcinogenesis. Proteins that control the cytoskeleton, including those that regulate microtubule dynamics and spindle assembly, can be oncogenic when altered. Our goal is to understand the function of the centrosome in cytoskeletal organization and other cellular processes. To achieve this, we must understand the roles of proteins that function at the centrosome. Our main focus is on Centrosomin (Cnn), a major core component of centrosomes in Drosophila. Cnn is a phosphoprotein with three putative leucine zippers, extensive coiled-coil domains, and two novel motifs that are highly conserved across species. Cnn is required to assemble functional centrosomes at mitosis. In somatic cells that lack Cnn, mitosis occurs efficiently, but by an alternate, anastral pathway. We hypothesize that the anastral pathway for mitosis may be a vestige of an evolutionary precursor to the current centrosomal mode of mitosis that is found in most animal cells. The purpose of this project is to understand the functions of Cnn and centrosomes in cell division, and to define the anastral pathway for mitosis. Three specific aims are designed to accomplish these goals. The first aim is to dissect the functional domains in Cnn protein using in vivo functional and rescue assays, to examine potential human homologs by rescue of Cnn in Drosophila, and to examine the role of phosphorylation in Cnn function. Our second aim is to identify Cnn protein partners using genetic and biochemical approaches, then assay their localization in the cell, their role in centrosome function, and their role in centrosomal localization of Cnn. Our third aim is to define the anastral meiosis-like pathway that is induced in cells that lack Cnn. The mechanisms for spindle assembly and chromosome segregation at mitosis in cells that lack Cnn (and have dysfunctional centrosomes) will be investigated. n/a",Centrosomin and Centrosomes in Cell Division,7268755,R01GM068756,"['Amino Acids', 'Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Cycle Stage', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line', 'Cell division', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Centrosome', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chromosomal Stability', 'Chromosome Segregation', 'Chromosomes', 'Coiled-Coil Domain', 'Complex', 'Cultured Cells', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Drosophila genus', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Incubated', 'Length', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Maps', 'Meiosis', 'Microtubule-Organizing Center', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic', 'Mitotic Spindle Apparatus', 'Mitotic spindle', 'Mutate', 'Normal Cell', 'Oncogenic', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Fragment', 'Protein Phosphatase 2A Regulatory Subunit PR53', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Proteins', 'Purpose', 'RNA Interference', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Sepharose', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Structure', 'Vertebrates', 'Yeasts', 'carcinogenesis', 'cell type', 'chromosome movement', 'cofactor', 'daughter cell', 'design', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'mutant', 'novel', 'protein function', 'research study', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2007,258854,0.050419470424646125
"Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is a Fast-Track application to provide reliable, cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in cancer biopsies to assist pharmaceutical drug development and provision of patient-specific prognosis and therapy guidance (""personalized medicine""). The organizing theme is that the appropriate unit of analysis should be the individual cell as opposed to averaged tumor extracts. To this end, novel technologies will be coupled with careful methods-development. Spectral imaging and advanced image analysis tools will permit multi-target immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or immunofluorescence (IF) detection, at the cellular and subcellular level in intact tissue sections. CRi-developed image processing and machine-learning tools provide automation and sophisticated quantitation options. Multiplexed staining protocols will yield independent, potentially stoichiometric labeling with combined IHC and IF. The sensitivity of all potential markers to variations in tissue handling will be carefully assessed; some may be robust and suitable for archival tissue studies, others will be too labile. Ultrasound-assisted fixation will be tested for its ability to preserve such labile epitopes for use in prospectively acquired tissues. Four or more pathway-related proteins will be detected in tissue sections, on a cell-by-cell basis, even if co-localized and with spectrally overlapping labels. The coordinated subcellular location of the pathway molecules will be also tracked, with simultaneous assessment of cell-surface receptors (e.g., EGFR, VEGF, Her2-neu), downstream signaling proteins and phosphoproteins (e.g., pAKT, pERK), nuclear proteins (e.g., ER, Ki67), and novel players such as protein-folding mediators (e.g. BIP1).       The project will combine optimized tissue protocols, multiplexed IHC/IF reagent kits, and unique machine- learning image analysis that can be used to automate region-detection and label-quantitation. All these depend on CRi's multispectral imaging approaches for assessing multiple analytes on a cell-by-cell and cell- compartment basis in tissue sections. Our collaborators will provide small-animal tumor models for early methods development, multiplexed immunohistochemical labeling of pathway proteins in clinical cancer biopsies, access to archived and prospectively acquired tissues from pathway-targeting clinical drug trials, highly informative archival tissue microarrays, access to validated, activation-specific antibodies, ultra-fast tissue fixation, and biostatistics support. The ""deliverable"" will be a suite of products suitable for clinical use that can provide much-needed valid information on single-cell-based pathway status in an intact tissue context to support pharmaceutical drug development efforts and provide molecularly focused patient care.       Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine, which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific patients. Conventional molecular pathology methods are typically limited to a single immunohistochemical (IHC) test on a given tissue section or to expensive and time-consuming proteomics or expression-array approaches (which cannot directly report out pathway activation status in cancer cell populations and subpopulations). Multiplexed IHC (including immuno-fluorescence) combined with optimized sample handling protocols to retain pathway proteins and advanced image analysis will enable the unambiguous detection of active signaling pathways, benefiting pharmaceutical research in the selection of patients for better targeted trials and in the monitoring of response, and clinical practice for diagnosis, therapy selection, and monitoring response (i.e., theranostics).          n/a",Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging,7298872,R44CA130026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Avastin', 'BAY 54-9085', 'BIK gene', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'British Columbia', 'CD34 gene', 'Calibration', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Correlative Study', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'Employment', 'Energy Transfer', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Fixatives', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Localized', 'Location', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Nuclear Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Reagent', 'Receptor Activation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roche brand of trastuzumab', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transillumination', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Weight', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'commercialization', 'day', 'design', 'drug development', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lapatinib', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'member', 'method development', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'nanoparticle', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'protein folding', 'research study', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'statistics', 'subcutaneous', 'tissue culture', 'tissue processing', 'tissue/cell culture', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R44,2007,227868,0.03425364700441769
"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impared Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urban intersections are the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard camera cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Drawing on our recent work on computer vision algorithms that help a blind person find crosswalks and other important features in a street intersection, as well as our ongoing work on cell phone implementations of algorithms for indoor wayfinding and for reading digital appliance displays, we will refine these algorithms and implement them on a cell phone. The information extracted by the algorithms will be communicated to the user with a combination of synthesized speech, audio tones and/or tactile feedback (using the cell phone's built-in vibrator). Human factors studies will help determine how to configure the system and its user controls for maximum effectiveness and ease of use, and provide an evaluation of the overall system. The street intersection analysis software will be made freely available for download into any camera-equipped cell phone that uses the widespread Symbian operating system (such as the popular Nokia cell phone series). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software. Ultimately a user will be able to download an entire suite of such algorithms for free onto the cell phone he or she is already likely to be carrying, without having to carry a separate piece of equipment for each function. Relevance: The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task. The proposed research would result in a highly accessible system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to augment existing wayfinding techniques, which could dramatically improve independent travel for blind and visually impaired persons.           n/a",A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impared Pedestrians,7298706,R01EY018345,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Figs - dietary', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Left', 'Light', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Modification', 'Operating System', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Zebra', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'day', 'digital', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'legally blind', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'skills', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'way finding']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2007,338243,0.07012299604666453
"BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated.  Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06). In vivo studies will use a preclinical heterotopic bone implantation model to examine the in vivo bone forming capacity of hMSC. Mathematical modeling will be used to describe kinetics of BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation, and Bayesian learning will be used to discover signaling networks that are unique to BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation.  The completion of this five-year project will not only demonstrate the utility of BMP6 therapeutically to control hMSC osteoblast differentiation, but will also reveal novel signaling and transcriptional networks that govern hMC osteoblast differentiation. Long term, the identity of novel targets will lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic options for directing hMSC differentiation in tissue engineered constructs to repair bone. n/a",BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation,7488678,R01DE017471,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autologous', 'BMP2 gene', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen Type I', 'Collagraft', 'Condition', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Marrow', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Numbers', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Range', 'Receptor Activation', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Role playing therapy', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Development', 'Stem cells', 'Stimulus', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'UC06', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial repair', 'dosage', 'drug discovery', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'long bone', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2007,49965,0.052203731455607305

"Novel TIRF microscopy analyzing trafficking & signaling at the cell cortex My major goal is to advance knowledge about events on or near the plasma membrane. This region directly controls membrane traffic to and from the cell surface (exo- and endocytosis) and is where extracellular signals are amplified and modulated by assembly of signaling scaffolds. The introduction of total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, a technique that allows unprecedented axial resolution, has revolutionized studies of dynamic processes at the cell cortex. I propose 1) to develop two highly innovative multi-angle TIRF microscopes and 2) to apply these instruments towards the elucidation of mechanisms that regulate exo- and endocytosis. These microscopes will allow the penetration depth of the light beam to be varied rapidly and avoid traditional imaging artifacts. Together with new analytical methods, they will permit high-resolution 3D imaging of a ~50- 1000 nanometer cortical region of living cells. Additionally, a highly innovative FRAP implementation will allow us to `pulse' photoactivate single vesicles and track their fate. I will use this novel instrumentation to expand our ongoing studies on exo- and endocytic traffic. A main new goal will be to elucidate mechanisms in the vesicular trafficking pathways that regulate levels of glucose transporters (Glut4) at the cell surface, a process whose dysfunction leads to type 2 diabetes. I will test the hypothesis that the exocyst complex participates in the spatial regulation of the insulin responsiveness of Glut4 vesicle exocytosis. Using photoactivatable Glut4-Dendra I will determine whether insulin signaling triggers a switch from lipid raft to clathrin-mediated endocytic pathways. To address where PI3K signaling acts, I will implement inducible dimerization technology to rapidly turn on/off PI(3,4,5)P3 at the plasma membrane. The innovative approaches of this proposal capitalize on my unique expertise in interdisciplinary research spanning instrumentation, cell biology, and quantitative biology and will fundamentally impact biology and a medically important field. n/a",Novel TIRF microscopy analyzing trafficking & signaling at the cell cortex,7432044,DP2OD002980,"['1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase', 'Abbreviations', 'Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adipocytes', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Buffers', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Cell Line', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clathrin', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Collimator', 'Color', 'Coma', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Dimerization', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drops', 'Dyes', 'Employee Strikes', 'Endocytosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exocytosis', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Figs - dietary', 'Flare', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic Screening', 'Germany', 'Glass', 'Glucose Transporter', 'Glycerol', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Insulin', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Length', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Localized', 'Location', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Microdomains', 'Membrane Protein Traffic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'PTEN gene', 'Paper', 'Parasites', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase, Catalytic, Gamma Polypeptide', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Photobleaching', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Planet Mars', 'Play', 'Pliability', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Private Sector', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Pulse taking', 'Pupil', 'Quantum Dots', 'RNA Interference', 'Radial', 'Randomized', 'Range', 'Reagent', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Refractive Indices', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Solid', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Spain', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Spottings', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Support of Research', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Transfection', 'Tubulin', 'Vesicle', 'Visual', 'Wolves', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'basal insulin', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cell cortex', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'concept', 'day', 'density', 'design', 'desire', 'extracellular', 'flotillin', 'fluorescence imaging', 'fluorescence microscope', 'fluorophore', 'handbook', 'human wyatt protein', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'insulin signaling', 'interest', 'lens', 'medical schools', 'micromanipulator', 'migration', 'millisecond', 'mouse wyatt protein', 'nanometer', 'novel', 'object shape', 'photoactivation', 'prototype', 'radius bone structure', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'scaffold', 'simulation', 'single molecule', 'success', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'trans-Golgi Network', 'trend', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",OD,YALE UNIVERSITY,DP2,2007,2481250,0.06367958976937023
"Centrosomin and Centrosomes in Cell Division DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The equal distribution of chromosomes into daughter cells depends upon the accurate assembly of the mitotic spindle at cell division. The inappropriate segregation of chromosomes leads to aneuploidy, which can result in cell death or carcinogenesis. Proteins that control the cytoskeleton, including those that regulate microtubule dynamics and spindle assembly, can be oncogenic when altered. Our goal is to understand the function of the centrosome in cytoskeletal organization and other cellular processes. To achieve this, we must understand the roles of proteins that function at the centrosome. Our main focus is on Centrosomin (Cnn), a major core component of centrosomes in Drosophila. Cnn is a phosphoprotein with three putative leucine zippers, extensive coiled-coil domains, and two novel motifs that are highly conserved across species. Cnn is required to assemble functional centrosomes at mitosis. In somatic cells that lack Cnn, mitosis occurs efficiently, but by an alternate, anastral pathway. We hypothesize that the anastral pathway for mitosis may be a vestige of an evolutionary precursor to the current centrosomal mode of mitosis that is found in most animal cells. The purpose of this project is to understand the functions of Cnn and centrosomes in cell division, and to define the anastral pathway for mitosis. Three specific aims are designed to accomplish these goals. The first aim is to dissect the functional domains in Cnn protein using in vivo functional and rescue assays, to examine potential human homologs by rescue of Cnn in Drosophila, and to examine the role of phosphorylation in Cnn function. Our second aim is to identify Cnn protein partners using genetic and biochemical approaches, then assay their localization in the cell, their role in centrosome function, and their role in centrosomal localization of Cnn. Our third aim is to define the anastral meiosis-like pathway that is induced in cells that lack Cnn. The mechanisms for spindle assembly and chromosome segregation at mitosis in cells that lack Cnn (and have dysfunctional centrosomes) will be investigated. n/a",Centrosomin and Centrosomes in Cell Division,7101773,R01GM068756,"['SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis', 'cell cycle', 'centrosome', 'chromosome movement', 'immunoprecipitation', 'mass spectrometry', 'mitotic spindle apparatus', 'phosphoproteins', 'phosphorylation', 'protein structure function', 'tissue /cell culture', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SW MED CTR,R01,2006,266585,0.050419470424646125
"Intelligent Microtome Instrumentation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Locating fluorescently-tagged cells in whole organisms is important to the development of gene therapy, stem cell therapy delivery methods, and for drug research. This project will develop an intelligent microtome to identify fluorescently labeled cells in whole mice and to collect those cells in thin sections. During Phase I, a small-mammal cryomicrotome with LED-based tissue illumination for fluorescence imaging will be constructed. Several CCD cameras will be evaluated to establish the spatial resolution and gray-scale resolution needed to provide necessary fluorescence-imaging capabilities for the instrument. The instrument will be tested on isolated muscle, tissue homogenates containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled cells, and on whole mice. The cells expressing GFP in these samples will provide data for the development of next-generation instrumentation during Phase II.       Phase II will add capabilities to use the fluorescence image data to intelligently acquire thin sections only when fluorescent cells are detected. Fluorescence images acquired during sectioning will provide morphological guides to identify and isolate the same cells in mounted sections by laser-capture microdissection. Automated thin-tissue acquisition will be an added capability and will be integrated with intelligent fluorescence analysis to produce a completely automated instrument. The instrument will allow processing of whole animals to obtain thin sections for laser dissection and for biochemical and/or PCR post processing of select tissue regions.           n/a",Intelligent Microtome Instrumentation,7154878,R43HL086267,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment', 'biomedical equipment development', 'computer program /software', 'computer system hardware', 'digital imaging', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'genetically modified animals', 'green fluorescent proteins', 'laboratory mouse', 'molecular /cellular imaging', 'muscle', 'muscular dystrophy', 'phantom model', 'sectioning', 'three dimensional imaging /topography']",NHLBI,"BARLOW SCIENTIFIC, INC.",R43,2006,100000,0.052150507652614156
"Minority Predoctoral Fellowship Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cell division cycle (cdc) is a tightly regulated process. Centrosomes are the main microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in most animal cells. Aberrations in this process often lead to cell abnormality, resulting in cell death or possibly oncogenesis. A common feature of tumor cells is abnormal centrosome numbers. The broad goal of this research proposal is to understand how the centrosome matures, maintains proper integrity, and what genes regulate its activity and function. The specific aims are to study centrosomin (Cnn), a core centrosomal protein necessary for centrosomal function, by mapping its functional domains and identifying interacting partners. Another specific aim is to identify the Drosophila homologs of Centrin, a centriolar protein implicated in centrosome duplication. Identification of fly Centrin based on sequence similarity to mammalian and yeast Centrin, followed by mutant analysis and RNAi in cell culture, will permit functional studies of Centrin in the fly.

"BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated. Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06). In vivo studies will use a preclinical heterotopic bone implantation model to examine the in vivo bone forming capacity of hMSC. Mathematical modeling will be used to describe kinetics of BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation, and Bayesian learning will be used to discover signaling networks that are unique to BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation. The completion of this five-year project will not only demonstrate the utility of BMP6 therapeutically to control hMSC osteoblast differentiation, but will also reveal novel signaling and transcriptional networks that govern hMC osteoblast differentiation. Long term, the identity of novel targets will lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic options for directing hMSC differentiation in tissue engineered constructs to repair bone.           n/a",BMP6 Induction of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteoblast Differentiation,7368654,R01DE017471,[' '],NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2006,246436,0.052947274765905376

"Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic sequencing in nanopores shows great promise for inexpensive DNA sequencing at high speed and with minimal preparative steps. Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human SNPs or other genetic variations, which would in turn have a significant impact in pharmacogenomics and other disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome. Recently, researchers identified the inability to regulate the speed of a molecule's translocation through the pore as the primary obstacle to realizing the sequencing potential of hemolysin nanopores.      The proposed research will investigate the application of feedback control to substantially improve the ability to regulate molecule translocation speeds in a nanopore, thereby improving the ability to sequence with existing nanopore technology. In particular, the primary goal is to design novel hardware and software algorithms for feedback control of single polymers in a hemolysin nanopore on a microsecond time scale and with near angstrom precision. Such capability would contribute to the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies, augment the efforts of the $1000/mammalian genome project, and be a revolutionary contribution to the realm of applied feedback control. The control algorithms would also leverage the long-term objective of the proposed effort: the development of a nanopore-based single cell analyzer. The device would enable one to efficiently determine the concentration of all mRNA in a single cell at an instant of time. This technology would improve the ability to accurately track molecular events that occur during cell differentiation, by reducing the number of cells required for event detection and increasing the time resolution of detection measurements.        There are two primary aspects to the proposed research program that are necessary augmentations to my expertise in control. First, I will engage in a two-year intensive period of didactic training in relevant courses, including molecular and cellular biology, embryology, cell signaling, genomics and bioinformatics. The basic understanding gained is required for success in the application of control to problems in human health broadly, and in technology development for cell interrogation specifically. Second, I will participate in the $1000/mammalian genome project to learn about the physics and biology of the hemolysin nanopore. In parallel to the $1000 genome project, I will explore the controlled capabilities of the nanopore for efficient mRNA sequencing, using tools from bioinformatics and machine learning to translate the controlled response data into the identity of unknown nucleotides.          n/a",Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore,7130891,K25HG004035,"['RNA', 'bioinformatics', 'cell sorting', 'copolymer', 'electrical potential', 'genome', 'hemolysin', 'human', 'learning', 'nucleotides', 'polymers']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,K25,2006,124719,0.0499837382177984
"Centrosomin and Centrosomes in Cell Division DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The equal distribution of chromosomes into daughter cells depends upon the accurate assembly of the mitotic spindle at cell division. The inappropriate segregation of chromosomes leads to aneuploidy, which can result in cell death or carcinogenesis. Proteins that control the cytoskeleton, including those that regulate microtubule dynamics and spindle assembly, can be oncogenic when altered. Our goal is to understand the function of the centrosome in cytoskeletal organization and other cellular processes. To achieve this, we must understand the roles of proteins that function at the centrosome. Our main focus is on Centrosomin (Cnn), a major core component of centrosomes in Drosophila. Cnn is a phosphoprotein with three putative leucine zippers, extensive coiled-coil domains, and two novel motifs that are highly conserved across species. Cnn is required to assemble functional centrosomes at mitosis. In somatic cells that lack Cnn, mitosis occurs efficiently, but by an alternate, anastral pathway. We hypothesize that the anastral pathway for mitosis may be a vestige of an evolutionary precursor to the current centrosomal mode of mitosis that is found in most animal cells. The purpose of this project is to understand the functions of Cnn and centrosomes in cell division, and to define the anastral pathway for mitosis.

"Attractors of Complex Signal Transduction Systems   DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Biochemical signal transduction is a        critical basic cellular process by which information travels from the receptors      on the surface of a cell to the nucleus where responses to the signals are           generated. Originally thought to be a relatively simple system that merely           passed along signals, signal transduction has proven to be a highly complicated      system of molecules whose interactions have yet to be fully understood.              Furthermore, a number of disease states such as cancer, diabetes, and                neurological disorders have their origins in malfunctioning signal transduction      components. Until signal transduction is understood in its totality, rational        intervention of these diseases will be significantly hampered. While                 conventional laboratory methods have been used to study individual components        or pathways involved in signal transduction, they have less utility in studying      how signal transduction systems work as a whole and therefore do not detect          higher levels or organization and regulation that are known to exist in other        complex systems. In this application, it is proposed that signal transduction        systems be mathematically modeled and analyzed in order to determine the role        of complexity in the system. It is hypothesized that signal transduction             involves both the movement and processing of information in such a way as to         provide a cell the capacity for decision making, something every cell must           possess at some level.

Furthermore, a number of disease states such as cancer, diabetes, and                neurological disorders have their origins in malfunctioning signal transduction      components. Until signal transduction is understood in its totality, rational        intervention of these diseases will be significantly hampered. While                 conventional laboratory methods have been used to study individual components        or pathways involved in signal transduction, they have less utility in studying      how signal transduction systems work as a whole and therefore do not detect          higher levels or organization and regulation that are known to exist in other        complex systems. In this application, it is proposed that signal transduction        systems be mathematically modeled and analyzed in order to determine the role        of complexity in the system. It is hypothesized that signal transduction             involves both the movement and processing of information in such a way as to         provide a cell the capacity for decision making, something every cell must           possess at some level. The most advanced techniques in the field of chaos            theory and neural networks (the basis of artificial intelligence) will be            applied to determine whether biochemical signal transduction systems have the        fundamental features of a complex system, how those features might be used for       cell level decision making, and how mutations in the system might affect the         higher level functions of the system. The elucidation of such higher levels of       function in signal transduction systems would greatly enhance our understanding      of this basic cellular function and make the rational design of therapy more         effective.                                                                                                                                                                n/a",Attractors of Complex Signal Transduction Systems,6640799,R01GM067272,"['biological information processing', ' biological signal transduction', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' mathematical model', ' mathematics', ' model design /development']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA OMAHA,R01,2003,208750,0.02487053390266664
"Rare Cell Analysis by Multi-Spectral Flow Imaging The ability to detect and analyze rare malignant cells in body fluids has profound implications for the early detection of malignancy as well as for monitoring of residual disease and metastases. Current methodologies for accurately detecting abnormal cells within a population of normal cells are limited. Amnis' ImageStream technology combines the high-resolution imaging performance of microscopy and the high-speed cellular analysis and sorting capabilities of flow cytometry in a single platform. ImageStream employs time delay integration detection, resulting in up to a 1000 fold increase in signal collection over conventional instrument designs. The goal of this Phase I study is to optimize algorithms, electronics, and assays for the detection and analysis of rare exfoliated cells in body fluids. The image segmentation algorithm will be redesigned to operate with brightfield imagery as well as fluorescence and implemented on high-speed image computing hardware. A morphological feature set will be developed to discriminate epithelial cells. Ultimately, it is expected that instrumentation based on ImageStream technology will find application in the biological research laboratory, drug discovery arena, and in the clinical setting as a screening system for he early detection of cancer. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Amnis' ImageStream technology represents an entirely new class of cellular analysis instrumentation with numerous opportunities for commercialization. It is expected that ImageStream will find application in drug discovery, biological research, genomics and proteomics, non- invasive prenatal diagnostics and early-stage cancer detection. n/a",Rare Cell Analysis by Multi-Spectral Flow Imaging,6446577,R43CA094590,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cell line', ' cell population study', ' cell type', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' cytology', ' fluorescence microscopy', ' fluorescent dye /probe', ' human tissue', ' image processing', ' imaging /visualization /scanning']",NCI,AMNIS CORPORATION,R43,2002,124380,0.007053757957852566

"CIPER--A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATOR INVOLVED IN CANCER Dysfunction of apoptotic pathways plays a critical role in the development of cancer, and the identification and characterization of genes encoding regulators of apoptosis is therefore critical for understanding the pathophysiology of cancer and for developing novel therapeutic approaches. The laboratory has identified CIPER, a gene that regulates both apoptosis and the NF-kB signal transduction pathway, one which is associated with cell survival. Because of this dual function, CIPER appears to play an important role as the control point of a molecular decision-tree; under some circumstances, CIPER may promote apoptosis, while at other times CIPER may favor cell survival. Importantly, the CIPER gene has been found to be located at the chromosomal breakpoint region of t(1;14), a recurrent translocation associated with MALT B-cell lymphoma, and is frequently mutated in lymphomas of various other histologic types as well as some non-lymphoid neoplasms. Our hypothesis is that CIPER promotes tumor development through a combination of dysregulated apoptosis and NF-kB signaling which result from chromosomal mutations affecting the CIPER gene. We are proposing a series of aims to further define the molecular mechanisms by which CIPER controls these signaling pathways, to understand the cellular stimulae which influence CIPER function, and to explore how natural mutations in the CIPER gene affect its important role as a regulator of cell survival.  n/a",CIPER--A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATOR INVOLVED IN CANCER,6463554,F32CA088470,"['B cell lymphoma', ' apoptosis', ' biological signal transduction', ' chromosome translocation', ' gene mutation', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neoplastic transformation', ' nuclear factor kappa beta', ' phosphoproteins', ' regulatory gene', ' tissue /cell culture']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2002,33997,0.007657044960143826
"MODELLING CELL MEDIATED IMMUNE RESPONSES IN THE COMPUTER DESCRIPTION:  (Adapted from the applicant's abstract) Impressive advances in     computer technology have opened the way to the simulation in machina of          complex biological systems.  In immunology, this has proven helpful as it        can foster both critical phases of generating and testing novel hypotheses.      At variance with ""conventional"" models based upon differential equations,        the applicant has reproduced the dynamics of the humoral response by means       of cellular automata, where discrete entities cooperate and develop              according to elementary local rules.                                                                                                                              The success of this model in tackling several ""hot"" aspects currently            debated among immunologists signals that the time is ripe for the                exploration of the complex and challenging cell-mediated immunity.                                                                                                The subject of this proposal is a computer simulation of the immune response     to viral infection and to foreign cells.  This requires an extensive             upgrading of our IMMSIM code, including the introduction of infective            antigens, target cells, dendritic cells, CD8 T cell receptors and class I        MHCs.  The body is represented by a bi-dimensional space subdivided into         sites where all interactions take place in discrete time steps.                  Interactions are probablistic occurrences between cells that take place via      their receptors, on the basis of complementarity between binary bit strings.     These interactions may lead to destruction, presentation, stimulation or         tolerance.  As in the living organism, a virus-specific Tc precursor will        become anergic by meeting a Class I-bearing infected target cell but will        mature to a serial killer upon binding to a DC that has attracted a Th cell,     whose lymphokines will act on both Tc and DC.                                                                                                                     The outcome of each event depends on a number of parameters of largely           unknown biological weight.  Their effects will be tested experimentally by       running the same response serially, varying one parameter at a time, and         comparing the results to ascertained immunological behaviors.  This will         allow us to identify the critical nodes of the virus/response progress and       then to use the model to challenge further fundamental aspects, such as          viral mutation, lymphoid cell infection, and, ultimately, the                    cooperative/competitive interplay between the cellular and humoral response      against the same invader.                                                         n/a",MODELLING CELL MEDIATED IMMUNE RESPONSES IN THE COMPUTER,6137236,R01AI042262,"['MHC class I antigen', ' T cell receptor', ' antigen presenting cell', ' antigens', ' artificial intelligence', ' biological models', ' cell transplantation', ' cell type', ' cellular immunity', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' dendritic cells', ' foreign body reaction', ' humoral immunity']",NIAID,HOSPITAL FOR JOINT DISEASES ORTHO INST,R01,2000,204225,0.07309398865403341

"Interpretable deep learning models for translational medicine Understanding the state of cellular signaling systems provides insights to how cells behave under physiological and pathological conditions. Cellular signaling systems are organized as hierarchy (cascade) and signals of a molecular is often compositionally encoded to control cellular processes, such as gene expression. This project aims to develop advanced deep learning models (DLMs) to simulate cellular signaling systems based on gene expression data. In last 3 years, the project has made significant progresses, but the challenges remain. Importantly, contemporary DLMs behave as “black boxes”, in that it is difficult to interpret how signals are encoded and how to interpret which signal a hidden node represent in a DLM. This black-box nature prevents researchers from gaining biological insights using DLMs, even though these models can be much superior in modeling data than other types of models in many tasks, e.g., predicting drug sensitivity of cancer cells. In this competitive renewal, we propose to develop novel DLMs and innovative inference algorithms to train “interpretable” DLMs and apply them in translational research. The proposed research is innovative and of high significance in several perspectives: 1) Our novel DLMs and algorithms take advantage of big data resulting from systematic chemical/genetic perturbations of cellular signaling machinery, so that we can use the perturbation condition as side information to reveal how signals are encoded in a DLM. 2) We integrate principles of causal inference and information theory with deep learning method to make DLMs interpretable. As results, that researchers can gain mechanistic insights from such models. 3) Innovative application of interpretable DLMs will advance translational research. For example, we will train interpretable DLMs to model cellular signaling at the level of single cells and use this information investigate inter-cellular interactions among cells in tumor microenvironment to shed light on immune evasion mechanisms of cancers. We will also use information derived from interpretable DLMs to predict cancer cell drug sensitivity. We anticipate that our study will bring forth significant advances not only in deep learning methodology but also in precision medicine. This project aims to develop advance machine learning methods, referred to as deep learning models, to simulate cellular signaling systems, at both multiple cell and single cell levels. Success of these models will enable researchers to investigate cellular behaviors under physiological and pathological condition, and such information can be used to guide therapy of cancer patients.",Interpretable deep learning models for translational medicine,9972153,R01LM012011,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Grain', 'Human', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell behavior', 'chemical genetics', 'data modeling', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'patient response', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'translational model', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,309622,0.02962802026120734
"Combined Topological and Machine Learning Tools for Neuroscience Two major recent advances have raised the possibility of fundamental breakthroughs in both basic and clinical neuroscience: the development of new tools to probe the nervous system with single-cell resolution as well as brain-wide scope, and breakthroughs in machine learning methods for handling complex data. Yet there remain crucial barriers to progress: while data acquisition tools are now broadly within the grasp of neuroscience researchers, the same cannot be said about data analytical tools that can tackle the complexities of the new data sets being gathered. In addition, the highly training-data dependent, black-box Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods that have shown rapid growth in the technological domain, are not well-suited to scientific data analysis, where transparency and understanding is more important than black-box performance measures. This proposal brings together a cross-disciplinary team of leading neuroscience and computer science researchers to develop and deploy a critical set of data analytical tools for the neuroscience community. The tools will be useful for data already gathered in major group efforts in the US Brain Initiative, and also for new data sets being acquired using the tools developed in the Initiative.  Extraction of the projection morphologies of individual neurons, and the classification and analysis of neuronal cell types is a central goal of the Brain Initiative. Because data from various sources are often analyzed with custom algorithms, scaling up existing approaches for use across large datasets and multiple data types has been a challenge. Instead researchers need a comprehensive, flexible mathematical framework that can be applied to a wide variety of data, including both static and dynamic measures. We propose to achieve this goal by combining Topological Data Analysis (TDA) methods with Deep Net based machine learning methods. Such a combined approach retains the flexibility of data-driven ANN methods while at the same time brings in conceptually well-grounded methods from TDA that are still able to address the complexities of brain-wide data sets with single-cell resolution. Aim 1 of the proposal will use these methods to automate tasks in neuroanatomy previously requiring intensive human expert effort. Aim 2 will apply the methods to single cell omics data sets. Aim 3 will deploy the tools developed to the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network and the neuroscience community. Recent years have seen many advances in experimental tools for probing brains in unprecedented ways, with single cell resolution, and as a result both individual investigators and large consortia are generating brain-wide single-cell data at an unprecedented scale. To derive full benefit from these data sets, researchers need theoretical and computational tools to analyze, visualize and derive knowledge from the data. In the proposed work, theoretically principled tools from Topological Data Analysis, in particular Discrete Morse Theory, are combined with artificial neural networks for Machine Learning, to provide a computational and analytical framework to deal with the complexity of the large-scale, high-dimensional data sets and derive the full benefits for basic as well as clinical neuroscience research.",Combined Topological and Machine Learning Tools for Neuroscience,10123310,RF1MH125317,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Axon', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Performance', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Skeleton', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'complex data ', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data acquisition', 'data centers', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'high dimensionality', 'informatics tool', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical methods', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple data types', 'neuronal cell body', 'rapid growth', 'repository', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,RF1,2020,2048230,0.027701345030337984
"DEVELOP NOVEL DEEP LEARNING AND COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION METHODS TO IDENTIFY KEY DISEASE REGULATORY ELEMENTS FOR SINGLE-CELL DATA Contact Principal Investigator / Project Leader: Yang, Mary Organization: University of Arkansas Little Rock Title: DEVELOP NOVEL DEEP LEARNING AND COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION METHODS TO IDENTIFY KEY DISEASE REGULATORY ELEMENTS FOR SINGLE-CELL DATA Abstract Text: Description: Traditional bulk sequencing measures the average of cell population constituents, inevitably masking the intrinsic cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Single-cell technologies, on the other hand, enable a high-resolution measurement for each individual cell, providing new opportunities to capture cell population diversity and dissect the heterogeneity of complex diseases. Meanwhile, the high-sparsity and the relatively small number of sequencing reads pose new data analytic challenges. In this proposed project, we will develop innovative computational methods for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis and integration to identify key regulatory elements that underlie disease heterogeneity and drive disease development. The scRNA-seq data contains substantial proportion of zero expression counts due to low capture efficiency and stochastic gene expression. We will develop a novel data-driven deep learning model to recover the missing values. Our model utilizes a deep learning algorithm to capture complex and latent distributions of missing values without assuming an underlying distribution, thus, ensuring effective performance across various scRNA-seq generated by different protocols. scRNA-seq profiles enable characterization of unique transcriptome for each cell type. We hypothesize that disrupted expression patterns accompanying the disease development in different cell types are controlled by sequential alterations of the activity and connectivity in the regulatory networks. Hence, using scRNA-seq data, we will first infer cell lineage trajectories. Then, we will develop a novel deep neural network method to reconstruct cellular regulatory networks according to pseudo-time ordering of the cell types. With a new network alignment model, we will exploit the dynamic changes of regulations in the disease process, revealing key regulators and providing cell type-specific drug targets. The fulfillment of the proposed project will facilitate single-cell genomic and biomedical research efforts allowing for a much broader, cross-disciplinary understanding of the underlying mechanisms of complex diseases. The proposed project will be devised into capstone projects and will be primarily completed by undergraduate students under the PI's supervision with the assistance of a graduate student. The project will serve as a vehicle to equip undergraduate students with essential research skills and interdisciplinary knowledge, and to stimulate the students' ambition to pursue careers in the biomedical science. This project will create a multidisciplinary platform in a comprehensive university setting that encourages undergraduate students to engage in biomedical research.! Public Health Relevance Statement: This R15 project aims to provide novel deep learning and hybrid statistical methods to tackle challenges with a focus on single-cell genomic data to improve our understanding of disease evolution mechanisms and advance treatment strategies for the complex diseases. Our approaches enable the reconstruction of cell type-specific regulatory networks and infer dysregulated pathways in different cell types and the integration of the research efforts made on the bulk-level, hence, lead to further discoveries, accurate diagnosis and new cell type-specific therapies.

"Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings Project Summary: Darwin Babino, PhD, a trained pharmacologist/electrophysiologist, has spent the last ten years working on several disciplines in the vision sciences. His proposal entitled “Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings” presents his overarching goal to improve vision restoration approaches by developing methods to test the potential of these techniques thereby accelerating the development of effective interventions. Dr. Babino and his primary mentor, Dr. Russell Van Gelder, have assembled a strong team of co-mentors at the University of Washington SOM and collaborators to guide him through the proposed training and research. His previous training will be supplemented with goals to help his development as an independent investigator: 1) Study design and practical learning in performing panretinal (MEA) biological experiments; 2) Fundamental and advanced techniques of the proposed optogenetic and stem-cell restoration techniques; 3) Application of advanced machine learning techniques; 4) Develop leadership and professional skills to establish an independent group. The ability to assess the function of panretinal circuitry will foster our understanding of the advantages and weaknesses of different restoration techniques (Aim 1). The work proposed here will improve an existing retinal acuity assessment tool which combines machine learning techniques on novel, high-density multielectrode array recordings of ganglion cell responses in several mouse models. The utility of this system will be demonstrated in assessing visual potential of the mouse retina in three different approaches to vision restoration that are challenging for in vivo assessment (Aim 2). In collaboration with Dr. Deepak A. Lamba at UCSF, we will apply our system to animals which have undergone stem-cell replacement of retinal cells including photoreceptor cells. An optogenetics approach will also be evaluated in collaboration with Dr. John Flannery at UC Berkeley whose group has developed vectors for expressing rhodopsin and cone opsins in ganglion and bipolar cells. Finally, differences between native and restored vison with small molecule photoswitches, light-activated inhibitors of voltage-gated potassium channels, which confer light-dependent firing on treated cells, will be assessed. The resulting advanced electrophysiology application will help elucidate fundamental questions about the functional retina, mechanisms that lead to retinal degeneration and the potential of several therapeutics for the treatment of retinal diseases. Furthermore, this career development award will facilitate Dr. Babino’s development into an independent investigator by priming an R01 grant application. Project Narrative: Project Narrative: The prevalence of vision loss from retinal degeneration numbers in the millions world-wide and is expected to double by the year 2050, and despite the development of several promising approaches to restore vision in the blind, progress in developing these therapies has been hampered by challenges in analysis of these methods in animal models. We describe a novel system that analyzes, by machine learning, retinal ganglion cell output in native, degenerated and therapeutically treated blind retinas which can characterize the visual information content of the ‘reanimated’ blind retina and thereby facilitate the development of these technologies. The system developed through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to the assessment of potential retinal acuity restoration by current and novel therapeutic approaches.",Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings,9943144,K99EY031333,"['Aftercare', 'Amacrine Cells', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Applications Grants', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Blindness', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Cone', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Electroretinography', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Ganglia', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Light', 'MW opsin', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Opsin', 'Output', 'Photoreceptors', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Cone', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Retinal gene therapy', 'Rhodopsin', 'Rod', 'Rodent', 'Saccades', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Synapsins', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Universities', 'Vertebrate Photoreceptors', 'Viral', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual system structure', 'Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel', 'Washington', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior test', 'blind', 'career development', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'density', 'effective intervention', 'experimental study', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'light intensity', 'mimicry', 'mouse model', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'mutant', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'promoter', 'rapid eye movement', 'response', 'restoration', 'scale up', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'stem cells', 'technology development', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'vector', 'vision science', 'visual information']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,113080,0.01791798072109677
"A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy The purpose of this research is to provide a flexible prenatal genetic testing product that can be expanded to detect any inheritable trait as early as 5, and up to 20, weeks of gestation, from a safe, noninvasive Pap smear. Published studies, as well as our own experience, show that perinatal Pap collections using a cervical cytobrush pose no risk to mother or fetus, and captures trophoblast cells that migrate from the placenta into the reproductive tract. Trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC) efficiently isolates hundreds of trophoblast cells without limitations due to early gestational age, maternal obesity, or uteroplacental insufficiency disorders. In our report published in Science Translational Medicine, we isolated sufficient genomic DNA from intact fetal trophoblast cells obtained by TRIC at 5-19 weeks of gestation (n=20) to definitively distinguish maternal and fetal DNA by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short terminal repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to massively parallel sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal serum, which has a fetal fraction of only 4-10% at week 10 of gestation, the complete genome obtained by TRIC has a fetal fraction of 85-100%, and provides nucleotide-specific haplotyping. In our Phase I award, we developed this technology for prenatal genotyping of single gene disorders located on the hemoglobin B (HBB) gene, using custom multiplex PCR amplification of SNPs, STRs and loci across HBB for NGS. We successfully haplotyped the locus for the sickle cell disease (SCD) point mutation and genotyped the remainder of the HBB exome, which includes alternate SCD loci, beta thalassemias and anemias. In Phase II, we will expand the test to include HBA1 and HBA1 genes (alpha thalassemias) to provide a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy screen. Phase I studies revealed that genotyping was consistently accurate, unless cervical specimen collection was suboptimal and <40 trophoblast cells were isolated. Commercialization will require operators to obtain adequate specimens. We will accomplish six milestones towards commercialization of this test: 1. Incorporate the HBA1 and HBA2 loci into a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy test. 2. Optimize success rates through operator training and innovations in collection device designs to increase cervical cell recoveries. 3. Innovate a novel alternative method to cytobrush-based cervical collection. 4. Automate the TRIC processing pipeline for high throughput cell isolation, DNA purification and NGS. 5. Establish sample quality assessment tools powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. 6. Perform a clinical validation trial to assess test performance. With an estimated annual market potential over $284 million for prenatal hemoglobinopathies testing, the envisioned technology will fill an existing gap in clinical diagnostics and outcompete existing invasive prenatal testing. Our initial commercial product will to enable management of high-risk pregnancies and provide valuable information to physicians and patients in the process of establishing families. Specifically, this initial product will benefit pregnancies at risk of having a child with SCA or other hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and anemia. This research provides major public health benefits by leveraging a safe, noninvasive method to capture fetal cells that migrate into the reproductive tract from a Pap smear for development of genetic tests to identify women carrying a fetus with an inherited disorder. We will build a DNA sequencing kit that can be commercialized to determine the genotype of fetuses at risk for sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies as early as 5 weeks of pregnancy. Advances emerging from the proposed research will generate new clinical tools for managing pregnancy complications to benefit the well-being of mothers and their babies.","A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy",9940863,R44HD092205,"['African American', 'Amniocentesis', 'Anemia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Child', 'Chorion', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conceptions', 'Conceptus', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA purification', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genotype', 'Germ Cells', 'Gestational Age', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Pap smear', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speculums', 'Technology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vagina', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'alpha-Thalassemia', 'base', 'beta Thalassemia', 'cell free fetal DNA', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'data infrastructure', 'exome', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'fetus at risk', 'fetus cell', 'flexibility', 'genetic testing', 'genomic locus', 'hemoglobin B', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal obesity', 'maternal serum', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'operation', 'performance tests', 'perinatal health', 'phase 1 study', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'reproductive', 'reproductive tract', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'testing services', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational medicine', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,"CRADLE GENOMICS, INC.",R44,2020,901625,0.014360581952739539
"Dissecting the mechanism of cell migration at the systems level Project Summary/Abstract Cell migration is required for many important physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancerous invasion. As a process that involves concerted action of multiple ensembles of molecules over the length of the entire cell, cell migration cannot be understood using conventional molecular approaches alone without considering sensing, actuation, and control at the whole cell level. This project seeks to approach migrating cells in a top-down manner as an integrated mechanochemical system. Based on observations that likely represent the manifestation of a complex network of molecular interactions, we may deduct how the underlying machine operates. The project will be facilitated by the development of new technologies, including 3D printing of polyacrylamide hydrogels and machine learning for cell tracking, traction force microscopy, and super resolution imaging. We will address three important aspects. First, we will ask how cells initiate migration through a process known as symmetry breaking, which causes a symmetrically spreading cell to initiate directional migration. We will examine various anisotropic properties of the substrate as potential symmetry breaking cues. In addition, the function of filopodia as possible sensors for symmetry breaking will be studied with imaging and pharmacological approaches. Second, we will address several poorly understood aspects of 2D and 3D cell migration. By following migrating cells over a long distance at a high magnification, we expect to place the newly discovered process of contact following in the context of cell collectives. To understand how cell shape control, cell-cell interaction, and cell migration respond to 3D environment, we will use 3D printed polyacrylamide to create model systems and systematically vary geometrical and mechanical parameters. We will then extend the experiments to decellularized lung scaffolds, which have been used for tissue engineering, to determine how migration characteristics in 3D is related to the promotion of tissue formation. Another overlooked area we will examine is the function of the tail in defining cell polarity and mediating contact following. Third, we will seek mechanistic understanding of cellular responses to cyclic stretching, which occurs in various tissues. A novel imaging approach will allow us to determine the responses during the stretching and relaxation phase respectively. A combination of experimentation and computer modeling is planned to explain why epithelial cells respond to static stretching along the direction of forces but perpendicularly in response to cyclic stretching. We will also test the hypothesis that responses to cyclic stretching can cause cell intercalation, a fundamentally important process in embryonic morphogenesis. We expect our results to complement studies at the molecular level and bring paradigm shifting insights into cell migration for both basic cell biology and repair of tissue functions. Project Narrative This project seeks to fill important gaps of knowledge in cell migration, which is essential for many physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancerous invasion. We will use a top-down approach that treats migrating cells as an integrated mechanical system, and we are developing technologies such as 3D printing and artificial intelligence for fabricating experimental environments, following cell movements, and imaging interactions in 3D scaffolds. Knowledge in how migrating cells interact with the environment and with each other is expected to further our abilities to counter diseases and restore body functions.",Dissecting the mechanism of cell migration at the systems level,9931843,R35GM136345,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Filopodia', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Property', 'Relaxation', 'Resolution', 'Stretching', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Traction Force Microscopy', 'base', 'cell motility', 'experimental study', 'imaging approach', 'insight', 'intercalation', 'migration', 'new technology', 'novel', 'polyacrylamide', 'polyacrylamide hydrogels', 'response', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'tissue repair', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,275685,0.13285879012096105
"Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases of aging account for a significant proportion of healthcare spending and result in a painful and limiting existence for many tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of people around the world. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that re-purposes known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content fluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced in human cells in which diseases and treatments have been modeled. This system has been adapted to screen for drugs which may preferentially destroy senescent cells, as this may result in improved tissue function and decreases in pathology and mortality related to aging. In this SBIR fast-track proposal we will:  PHASE I Identify a morphological profile of senescence in a variety of human cell types. Progression to Phase II will depend on our ability to demonstrate the power of our morphological approach to identify senescent cells independent of any known senescent markers.  PHASE II Identify known drugs which preferentially destroy senescent cells, without affecting healthy cells, as identified by morphometric means.  Evaluate the efficacy of identified senolytic agents in a variety of tissue function and health-span models in mice. *Evaluate the effect of identified senolytic agents in a murine model of age-associated cardiovascular disease. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I/Phase II Fast-track SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds we identify as a result. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic diseases of aging affect a significant proportion of Americans. Cellular senescence, a useful biological program which prevents replication of cells exposed to various stresses that may be at risk of initiating tumors, has long-term deleterious inflammatory effects. We will combine biological, imaging, and computational approaches to identify complex morphological profiles associated with senescence, to identify senescence- killing effects of known drugs, and to evaluate any hits in relevant models of aging.",Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction,9948564,R44AG053131,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Aging', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'CDKN2A gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Aging', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Stress', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Length', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organ', 'Oxidants', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Telomere Shortening', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Tumor Suppression', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'beta-Galactosidase', 'cell type', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'functional disability', 'healthspan', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'senescence', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NIA,"RECURSION PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC",R44,2020,447905,0.02238304874253472
"Modeling Emergent Behaviors in Systems Biology: A Biological Physics Approach Project Summary Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.) due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological Physics, but draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of biological data now being generated by modern DNA sequencing-based techniques and quantitative microscopy. An important goal of the proposed research is to find common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and models systems. The proposed research pursues four distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1) understanding how distinct cell fates emerge from bimolecular interactions within mammalian cells (2) investigating how bimolecular networks within cells exploit energy consumption to improve computations, with applications to Synthetic Biology; (3) identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing techniques for synthetically engineering ecological communities; and (4) developing new machine learning algorithms and techniques for biological data analysis. In addition to developing physics-based models for diverse biological phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical important tools and algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) a new linear-algebra based algorithm for assessing the fidelity of directed differentiation and cellular reprogramming protocols and visualizing reprogramming/differentiation dynamics and (2) improved algorithms for inferring microbial interactions in the human microbiome from high-throughput sequence data. These computational tools will allow scientists to realize the immense therapeutic potential of cellular reprogramming and microbial ecology-based techniques for studying and treating human disease.

"Predictive engineering of cellular transcriptional state PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Specific combinations of transcription factors (TFs) exhibit emergent properties when functioning together, enabling the generation of diverse cell types and behaviors. However, identifying which combinations regulate a behavior of interest requires overcoming a combinatorial explosion, as among the ~1,600 TFs in the human genome there are ~1.3 million possible pairs alone. This scaling challenge has forced past efforts at systematically mapping such genetic interactions (GIs) to rely on simple, parallelizable measures of phenotype such as growth rate. Each GI is then characterized only by a single number, obscuring the mechanistic or molecular basis for any particular interaction: put simply, there are many ways for cells to appear equally “unfit.” Finally, many human cell types are quiescent or post-mitotic, so that the growth-based measures of interaction that have been highly successful in model organisms such as yeast do not apply. Here we address these challenges by introducing a new, massively parallel method for studying GIs in human cells that combines rich phenotyping of single cells with an analytical framework for predicting which combinations are most informative to measure. We leverage the recently developed Perturb-seq screening technology, which allows pooled profiling of CRISPR-mediated genetic perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing as the phenotypic readout. This approach allows us to overexpress many programmed combinations of TFs using CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and obtain a direct readout of their transcriptional consequences. The resulting rich phenotypes yield insight into the biological origins of GIs, and can for example identify combinations of TFs that promote differentiation to diverse cell states. They also provide a critical “handle” to apply modern machine learning methods. Using techniques from the field of compressed sensing, we propose a predictive approach for searching combinatorial spaces of GIs that would be too large to profile exhaustively by any experimental technology. Since the transcriptome is a direct readout of TF function and TFs interact via specific mechanisms such as cooperative binding at target promoters, these large-scale experiments can also be used to study deeper questions on how GIs emerge mechanistically, and how neomorphic (i.e. entirely new or unpredictable) phenotypes are generated. Our research provides the first scalable method for simultaneously finding and characterizing GIs in any system, a technique for rapidly mapping the “levers” controlling cell fate in diverse models of development and disease, and a model for how machine learning can be used to design the large combinatorial genetics experiments made possible by Cas9. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding how genes work together to realize different cellular phenotypes is one of the core problems of genetics. This proposal develops a new experimental and computational approach for mapping the different states that cells can occupy, and for identifying combinations of genes that push cells into these states. This technique will help us understand how complex interactions among genes affect human health and disease.",Predictive engineering of cellular transcriptional state,10001677,DP2GM140925,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Explosion', 'Gene Combinations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'cellular engineering', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'overexpression', 'promoter', 'rapid technique', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,DP2,2020,2655000,0.06681721983738981
"Computational Methods to Integrate and Interpret the Transcriptome from Single Cell and Tissue Level Data In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in discovery of genetic variants and genes associated with risk for psychiatric disorders. Altered gene expression in the brain, particularly at the cell-type-specific level, is believed to be a driving factor in conferring risk through these genetic variants. To link altered transcription to psychopathology, an immense amount of transcriptomic data is being accumulated, including single-cell and tissue level transcriptomes. Some of these samples cover critical developmental periods. An outstanding challenge is how to integrate single cell and tissue level transcriptomic data and how genetic variation alters transcription in specific cells to produce psychopathology. In this high dimensional ‘omics setting, we need powerful statistical and machine learning tools to produce integrative analyses and mesh those results with large psychiatric genetic datasets to achieve new insights. We propose to use our expertise in high dimensional statistical inference to tackle this challenge. We go beyond machine learning models that specialize in prediction, focusing instead on providing interpretable statistical inferences. We identify gene communities, defined in terms of cell type and spatiotemporal window, driving risk. With vast amounts of data comes great risk of spurious inferences based on non-rigorous analyses. On the other hand, reliable, but naïve tools can sacrifice power by not fully integrating all available information. Our overall objective to produce analytic tools that yield reliable and powerful inferences relating cell-type-specific gene expression with genetic risk factors. With these analytical tools made available to the research community, our longer-term goal is to hasten discoveries in the field and thus build the foundation from which therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders emerge. Our objectives will be accomplished with the following Specific aims: 1) statistically rigorous methods to select cell-type markers and to estimate cell-type-specific (CTS) expression, which will facilitate downstream analyses, including CTS eQTLs from tissue; 2) modeling dynamic gene communities throughout development of cell lineages or tissue and relating them to community-based-score statistics to gain insight into the impact of genetic risk factors on psychiatric disorders; and 3) novel methods for estimating gene co-expression networks from single cell RNA-seq. This contribution is significant because it will make many transcriptomic resources more valuable and enable downstream analyses, such as detection of CTS eQTLs in larger sample sets with higher power. Dynamic network analysis tools enhance our ability to identify gene communities that vary over developmental epochs and this variation facilitates inferences that relate cell type and developmental period with risk factors. The research proposed is innovative, in our opinion, because it uses novel statistical methods for integrative analysis of data from multiple sources, and cutting edge results to represent high dimensional data in a meaningful way that lends itself to clustering and network analysis. The statistical tools and results arising from the proposed research are relevant to public health because they will generate a deeper understanding of the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, the refined methods and new results provided by our research will be directly useful for the research community as they hunt for ways to prevent or treat mental disorders.",Computational Methods to Integrate and Interpret the Transcriptome from Single Cell and Tissue Level Data,10007193,R01MH123184,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'brain cell', 'case control', 'cell type', 'critical developmental period', 'gene discovery', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'prevent', 'psychogenetics', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,516076,0.018490894007025138
"Deciphering the building blocks of hippocampal circuits   Abstract   Since  Ramon  y  Cajal,  neuroscientists  have  speculated  that  even  the  most  complex  brain  functions  might  eventually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. Unfortunately, our under‐ standing of the brain's extensive diversity of cell types and elaborate circuitry remains far from complete. For  example, despite the hippocampus being essential for learning and memory and its dysfunction underlying a  wide variety of devastating neuropsychiatric disorders, we still lack fundamental knowledge about its constit‐ uent cell types and their molecular profiles and connectivity, slowing progress towards a mechanistic circuit‐ level understanding of memory formation. We propose to identify all of the interneuron cell types in area CA1  of the hippocampus and decipher their canonical connectivity. We have assembled a strong interdisciplinary  team  capable  of  combining  cutting‐edge  technologies  including  high‐throughput  multi‐cell  patch  recordings,  morphological reconstructions, single‐cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to achieve two main goals:  1) dissect CA1 microcircuit organization by generating a morphological and electrophysiological taxonomy of  all interneuron cell types in mouse CA1 and map their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of  morphologically defined CA1 interneurons using our newly developed Patch‐seq method. Our team recently  implemented  this  interdisciplinary  experimental  strategy  to  successfully  identify  cell  types  in  the  neocortex  and dissect their microcircuitry. Using multi‐cell patch clamp recording, we will characterize the electrophysi‐ ological properties, morphology, laminar location and connectivity of thousands of neurons from mouse CA1  hippocampus. We will also utilize a new, highly sensitive, cost effective technique for single‐cell RNA sequenc‐ ing (Smart‐seq2) to map their transcriptomes and machine learning techniques to classify cells into molecular  types.  Importantly,  our  high‐throughput  method  will  allow  us  to  obtain  morphological,  electrophysiological  and  complete  transcriptome  information  for  single  neurons,  which  cannot  be  achieved  using  other  methods  such as dissociating tissue for single‐cell sequencing. In‐house customization and automation has reduced our  sequencing costs, enabling us to sequence thousands of cells within a reasonable budget. Cell type identifica‐ tion will be validated using morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular tests. Identifying all of the in‐ terneuron  cell  types  that  comprise  CA1  and  determining  how  they  connect  to  each  other  will  have  a  broad,  paradigm‐shifting impact. For instance, it will contribute to a circuit‐level understanding of the computations  that take place in CA1, such as memory formation. From a clinical perspective, single‐cell transcriptome data

"A Scalable Platform for Exploring and Analyzing Whole Brain Tissue Cleared Images Abstract  The ability of accurate localize and characterize cells in light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) image is indispensable for shedding new light on the understanding of three dimensional structures of the whole brain. In our previous work, we have successfully developed a 2D nuclear segmentation method for the nuclear cleared microscopy images using deep learning techniques. Although the convolutional neural networks show promise in segmenting cells in LSFM images, our previous work is confined in 2D segmentation scenario and suffers from the limited number of annotated data. In this project, we aim to develop a high throughput 3D cell segmentation engine, with the focus on improving the segmentation accuracy and generality. First, we will develop a cloud based semi-automatic annotation platform using the strength of virtual reality (VR) and crowd sourcing. The user-friendly annotation environment and stereoscopic view in VR can significantly improve the efficiency of manual annotation. We design a semi-automatic annotation workflow to largely reduce human intervention, and thus improve both the accuracy and the replicability of annotation across different users. Enlightened by the spirit of citizen science, we will extend the annotation software into a crowd sourcing platform which allows us to obtain a massive number of manual annotations in short time. Second, we will develop a fully 3D cell segmentation engine using 3D convolutional neural networks trained with the 3D annotated samples. Since it is often difficult to acquire isotropic LSFM images, we will further develop a super resolution method to impute a high resolution image to facilitate the 3D cell segmentation. Third, we will develop a transfer learning framework to make our 3D cell segmentation engine general enough to the application of novel LSFM data which might have significant gap of image appearance due to different imaging setup or clearing/staining protocol. This general framework will allow us to rapidly develop a specific cell segmentation solution for new LSFM data with very few or even no manual annotations, by transferring the existing 3D segmentation engine that has been trained with a sufficient number of annotated samples. Fourth, we will apply our computational tools to several pilot neuroscience studies: (1) Investigating how topoisomerase I (one of the autism linked transcriptional regulators) regulates brain structure, and (2) Investigating genetic influence on cell types in the developing human brain by quantifying the number of progenitor cells in fetal cortical tissue. Successful carrying out our project will have wide-reaching impact in neuroscience community in visualizing and analyzing complete cellular resolution maps of individual cell types within healthy and disease brain. The improved cell segmentation engine in 3D allows scientists from all over the world to share and process each other’s data accurately and efficiently, thus increasing reproducibility and power. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a next generation cell segmentation engine for the whole brain tissue cleared images. Our proposed work is built upon our previous 2D nuclear segmentation project using deep learning techniques. However, we found that our current computational tool is limited in 2D segmentation scenario and insufficient of annotated training samples. To address these limitations, we will first develop a cloud-based semi-automatic annotation tool with the capacity of virtual reality. Our annotation tool is designed to be cross- platform, which allows us to partner with “SciStarter” (the largest citizen science projects in the world) and acquire large amount of cell annotations from the science enthusiastic volunteers. Meanwhile, we will develop next generation 3D cell segmentation engine using an end-to-end fully connected convolution neural network. To facilitate 3D cell segmentation, we will also develop a super resolution method to impute an isotropic high- resolution image from a low-resolution microscopy image. After the development of 3D cell segmentation engine, we will continue to improve its generality by developing a transfer learning framework which enables us to rapidly deploy our 3D cell segmentation engine to the novel microscopy images without the time-consuming manual annotation step. Finally, we will apply our segmentation tool to visualize and quantify brain structure differences within genetically characterized mouse and human brain tissue at UNC neuroscience center. In the end of this project, we will release the software (both binary program and source code) and the 3D cell annotations, in order to facilitate the similar neuroscience studies in other institutes. Considering the importance of high throughput computational tools in quantifying three dimensional brain structure, this cutting- edge technique will be very useful in neuroscience research community.",A Scalable Platform for Exploring and Analyzing Whole Brain Tissue Cleared Images,9923760,R01NS110791,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anecdotes', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Source Code', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Type I DNA Topoisomerases', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'computerized tools', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fetal', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'microscopic imaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'programs', 'stem cells', 'stereoscopic', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality', 'volunteer']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,335344,0.03235769310350001
"Symmetry Breaking and Collective Cell Growth in Drosophila Oogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY In many studied animal species, including mammals, the future oocyte develops within a cluster of cells that exchange molecules and organelles through a network of cytoplasmic bridges, which are formed by stabilized and reinforced cytokinetic furrows. While the formation and structure of this interesting class of multicellular systems has been extensively studied, their dynamics is poorly understood, leaving many critical questions about oocyte determination and development unanswered. I will investigate two of these questions in Drosophila, an experimental model that continues to provide valuable insights into general mechanisms of animal oogenesis. Using experimental, modeling, and computational approaches, I will investigate how one cell within the germline cell cluster is chosen to be the future oocyte and how the germline cell cluster comprising the oocyte and supporting nurse cells grows during development. Specifically, Aim 1 is designed to evaluate the differential contributions of the prepatterning and self-organizing mechanisms of oocyte determination. Focusing on the fusome, a membranous structure that is essential for intercellular communication in early oogenesis, and on a recently discovered positive feedback loop involving mRNA localization and translation, I will establish data- driven mathematical models for oocyte selection. In parallel, Aim 2 will investigate growth of the oocyte and supporting cells, using the germline cluster as a tractable system for exploring how the scaling laws established by studies of single cell growth are altered when cells grow together. In particular, I will focus on size regulation of nuclei and nucleoli, aiming to understand how their sizes adjust to rapidly increasing cell volumes within the germline cell cluster. The completion of these proposed studies, which are supported by strong preliminary results, including a machine learning approach for 3D image reconstructions and morphometric analysis, should provide new insights into some of the first steps of animal oogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will establish new quantitative approaches for studies of oocyte specification and collective cell size regulation during Drosophila oogenesis, an experimental system that continues to reveal highly conserved mechanisms of female germline development and provides unique opportunities for the integration of genetic, imaging, and computational techniques.",Symmetry Breaking and Collective Cell Growth in Drosophila Oogenesis,9910741,F31HD098835,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Volumes', 'Cells', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Insecta', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Messenger RNA', 'Nurses', 'Oocytes', 'Oogenesis', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Regulation', 'Regulation of Cell Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Supporting Cell', 'System', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'cell growth', 'design', 'egg', 'experimental study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'intercellular communication', 'mathematical model', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NICHD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,39120,0.09590153886269223
"Paneth cell phenotype as a predictive biomarker for ulcerative colitis ABSTRACT One of the challenges for the management of ulcerative colitis (UC; a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease) is the lacking of a predictive biomarker that can help stratify patients for personalized treatment strategies. We have previously shown that in Crohn’s disease (CD; another subtype of inflammatory bowel disease), the morphologic phenotype of small intestinal Paneth cells readily predicts outcome in post-surgical CD patients. Given the shared genetic etiology and clinical features between CD and UC, we hypothesize that Paneth cell phenotype will also predict outcome in UC. Our long-term goal is to define the clinical indications of inflammatory bowel disease of which Paneth cell phenotype can predict outcome. The objective of this grant is to determine to the extent of which Paneth cell phenotype predicts development of ileal complications in UC. The central hypothesis is that in UC patients undergoing total colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA), the Paneth cell phenotype obtained at time of colectomy will predict development of pouchitis and de novo CD in the ileal pouch. Our rationale is that Paneth cell phenotype will offer better outcome prediction over current practice. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim1) Paneth cell phenotype correlates with ileal complications in UC patients with IPAA; (Aim 2) Deep learning will reduce observer variation and enhance rigor and reproducibility of Paneth cell phenotype analysis in surgical pathology specimens, and also identify novel clinical factors that correlate with Paneth cell function; (Aim 3) Serum markers that correlate with Paneth cell phenotype could be used to predict outcome in UC. Upon conclusion, we will understand the role for Paneth cell function in modulating disease course in IBD. This contribution is significant since it will establish Paneth cell phenotype as a critical predictive biomarker for IBD. The proposed research is innovative because we use state-of-the-art deep learning approach to build an imaging analysis pipeline, and to identify novel clinical factors that affect Paneth cell functions. Identifying how epithelial cells with innate immune function affect disease course will provide insight into other inflammatory disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to the public health because ulcerative colitis, which is increasing in prevalence worldwide, represents a major national cost measured by both patient suffering and economic burden. Despite significant advances in care, clinical trial data demonstrate remission rates is at best of 40%. Strategies that stratify patients based on Paneth cell function represent a novel approach for outcome prediction. Upon conclusion, we will establish that Paneth cell phenotype is a predictive cellular biomarker for ileal complications in ulcerative colitis patients undergoing total colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis. We will also define the underlying genetic associations and molecular pathways of abnormal Paneth cell phenotype in these patients. In addition, we will develop deep learning algorithms that will streamline the interpretation of Paneth cell phenotype for pathology specimens, and define serum markers that correlate with Paneth cell phenotype to allow for less invasive and more frequent monitoring.",Paneth cell phenotype as a predictive biomarker for ulcerative colitis,10119843,R01DK124274,"['Affect', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colectomy', 'Complex', 'Cost Measures', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease remission', 'Economic Burden', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Excision', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Homeostasis', 'Ileal Reservoirs', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuals', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Natural History', 'Natural Immunity', 'Observer Variation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paneth Cells', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Pouchitis', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Small Intestines', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'gastrointestinal', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'improved', 'innate immune function', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intestinal epithelium', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,386463,0.07530606987015356
"Phenotypic Screening for Longevity Interventions Using Single-cell Epigenetic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. However, such interventions should have essentially no toxicity or side effects. In practice, the throughput of drug testing (currently conducted in animals) is one of the major limitations for identifying interventions to promote healthy aging. Hence, a challenge is to identify candidate drugs able to induce rejuvenation and/or healthy aging, with minimal side effects in a high throughput fashion. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel high content screening approach based on imaging of epigenetic landscape in single cells. To meet the challenge, we propose to take advantage of a novel technique we have developed that is rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level, automated microscopy, and machine learning. “Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes” (MIEL) captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. Pertinent to this application, we have tested whether MIEL approach is suitable for building a phenotypic cell-based assay for inducers of longevity at the cellular level. Our preliminary results validated MIEL assay for a high content screening application to identify novel candidate pro-longevity compounds. In sum, we have developed and validated a high content cell-based screening assay capable of identifying pro-longevity/healthy aging compounds based on their effect on epigenetic signature. Our specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1. Screen for novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation. Specific Aim 2. Validation of novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation.

"Novel approaches to study the intersection of cellular heterogeneity and tissue microanatomy Project Summary/Abstract “Novel approaches to study the intersection of cellular heterogeneity and tissue microanatomy” Positioning of cells in tissues is intimately linked to major cellular- and organ-level processes. Appropriate localization promotes exposure of cells to specific microenvironments and stimuli that define their differentiation states and functions. Cellular positioning also determines local tissue microanatomy, as well as the global macro-architecture, allowing for proper organ function and physiology. Thus, understanding the links among cellular positioning, heterogeneity and global tissue architecture are critical for biomedical research. However, current tools for understanding such relationships are limiting. Here, we will develop novel approaches to study cells using currently existing high-content tools, but importantly while also retaining information on the precise positioning of cells within tissues (Aim 1). This will allow us to interrogate how cellular heterogeneity and function is influenced by the exposure to distinct tissue microenvironments and localized stimuli. Further, we will generate novel computational approaches to understand how cellular positioning defines global tissue architecture (Aim 2). For this, we will develop a robust analytical methodology based on machine learning algorithms to study how complex patterns of cellular spatial positioning influences tissue organization and structure. These approaches will be broadly applicable across diverse disciplines of biology for both murine and human (or other species) studies, and will be highly pertinent in clinical settings, such as for cancer diagnostics. In summary, the proposed studies are significant, as they will provide a new toolbox for studying cellular and organ physiology based on cellular tissue positioning, as well as will lead to the development of new diagnostic tools for clinical medicine. Project narrative / Relevance statement The positioning of cells in tissues is critical for shaping both the cellular identity and function, as well as the structure and physiology of the entire organ. The proposed research will generate a novel, comprehensive toolbox for interrogating the relationships among cellular spatial positioning, cell heterogeneity, as well as tissue architecture. These tools will be relevant to public health because they will promote a better fundamental understanding of cellular and organ physiology, and because the developed tools will be directly applicable to the clinic, such as for pathology and diagnostic medicine.",Novel approaches to study the intersection of cellular heterogeneity and tissue microanatomy,9873919,R21AI142667,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bar Codes', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Label', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microanatomy', 'Molecular', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Neighborhoods', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'fluorophore', 'genetic manipulation', 'high dimensionality', 'human tissue', 'imaging approach', 'lymphoid neoplasm', 'lymphoid organ', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'organizational structure', 'patient stratification', 'protein expression', 'spatial relationship', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2020,220625,0.036520339346668686
"Mechanisms of mechanosensing through integrins Project Summary  Cells sense extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and physical forces applied through the ECM through integrin-mediated adhesions. These mechanotransduction processes play critical roles in embryonic development, normal physiology and multiple diseases, including cancer, hypertension, atherosclerosis and fibrosis among others. However, mechanical responses differ between cell types, between the same cell type in different states, and even in different regions of single cells. While much has been learned about mechanotransduction through integrins, a major area of ignorance is how different types and components of matrix adhesions modulate cell responses to force. The aim of this project is therefore to characterize the mechanosensing properties of distinct types and compositions of integrin mediated adhesions and elucidate the molecular basis for these differences.  A major limitation in our current understanding of mechanosensing by different types of adhesions is that current, morphology-based classifications into nascent, focal or fibrillary adhesions or focal complexes are imprecise, with little information about composition or structure. Additionally, adhesions in cells continuously evolve, so that actual adhesions are often mixtures of different types. Recent work has now defined specific molecular complexes that serve as modules for construction of different adhesion classes. Indeed, the data argue that adhesions have a modular structure with these protein complexes serving as the core modules that are combined and modified to generate diversity. Based on this hypothesis, we will: 1.Combine biochemical approaches with novel imaging and machine learning methods to elucidate the composition and behaviors of the distinct adhesion modules. 2.Utilize these biochemical and imaging methods in conjunction with assays of cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics and tension to characterize the cytoskeletal organization and dynamics for the distinct adhesion complexes. 3.Combine novel imaging and engineering approaches to characterize the distinct signaling properties of the different adhesion states and their responses to substrate stiffness and applied strain. Project Narrative Integrin mediated adhesions sense the mechanical properties of and forces applied through the extracellular matrix. A major area of ignorance in this field is how different types of adhesions differentially respond to mechanical information. One reason for this problem is our limited current understanding of the composition and structure of different types of adhesions. This multi-PO project will combine highly novel biochemical, imaging and image analysis, force measurement, mechanotransduction and signaling methods to develop a deeper understanding of the composition and structure of different adhesion types, and apply this information to understanding their cytoskeletal dynamics and mechanotransduction properties.",Mechanisms of mechanosensing through integrins,9933958,R01GM047214,"['Actomyosin', 'Adhesions', 'Admixture', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibrosis', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Integrins', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Talin', 'Vinculin', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mechanical properties', 'mechanotransduction', 'molecular imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'protein complex', 'response', 'sensor', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,412050,0.043383139925514715
"Calcium oscillations and cell motility with corneal injury According to the World Health Organization, corneal blindness from disease and injury is one of the top causes of blindness. Diabetes increases the risk of improper wound repair after minor scratches, corneal transplantation, and removal of epithelium during vitrectomy or refractive surgery. Altered focal adhesion, hemidesmosome, and cell-cell junction dynamics are common hallmarks of poor wound healing. Our group has demonstrated increased expression of the ATP-binding purinoreceptor, P2X7 in human diabetic corneas and in a murine model of Type II diabetes (DIO) accompanied by impaired wound healing. Furthermore, changes in P2X7 alters focal adhesion turnover and actin bundling in vitro that may lead to impaired wound healing. We have preliminary data from both wounded corneal epithelial cultures and explants demonstrating that sustained calcium oscillations occur after stimulation and travel between cells for hours. We found that when calcium mobilizations were absent between cells at the leading edge, that lamellipodial protrusions were absent. It is not known which receptor is required for this activity; however, we predict that the oscillations are a result of a highly-orchestrated activation of purinoreceptors. Previously we demonstrated that knockdown of specific purinoreceptors altered downstream signaling pathways that involve cell motility and adhesion proteins.  Our goal in this innovative proposal is to use image processing and machine learning to understand the events that occur in cell-cell communication that induce cell migration in corneal epithelia and to examine how these events are mediated in corneas from a diabetic induced obesity murine model. The proposal challenges the accepted paradigm that the cell-cell communication wave in the wounded cornea is a short-lived on-and-off signal, but that it is a prolonged oscillating signal needed for healthy epithelial cell migration to effectively heal the wounded cornea. As the calcium and motility assays yield large data sets and complex patterns, we are collaborating with a neuroscientist and a computer scientist to utilize machine learning to determine when cells will interact if specific receptors or complexes of receptors are activated. To address these questions, we will simultaneously perform live cell imaging of calcium mobilization, actin and ATP release in epithelium of wounded corneas under normal and diabetic conditions. The aims are: 1. To determine if there are specific response signatures elicited by the sustained calcium mobilizations and signaling generated with injury in control corneas and corneas from diet induced obesity mice; and 2. To determine if the intercellular calcium mobilizations required for the initiation of lamellipodial ruffling are necessary for proper migration? Narrative Injury to the cornea can be both painful and compromise vision. We and others have shown that repair and innervation of the diabetic cornea is compromised. Our goal is to use a combination of live cell imaging, computational modeling and molecular tools to determine the changes in signals that tell corneal epithelial cells to heal under control conditions compared to those under pathologic conditions such as diabetes.",Calcium oscillations and cell motility with corneal injury,9853790,R21EY029097,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Actins', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Bundling', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Oscillations', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Injury', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Fingerprint', 'Focal Adhesions', 'Goals', 'Hemidesmosomes', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impaired wound healing', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Intercellular Junctions', 'Keratoplasty', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Molecular', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Vitrectomy', 'World Health Organization', 'cell motility', 'computer science', 'corneal epithelial wound healing', 'corneal epithelium', 'diabetic', 'epithelial wound', 'healing', 'image processing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'large datasets', 'live cell imaging', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'nerve supply', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'receptor', 'release of sequestered calcium ion into cytoplasm', 'repaired', 'response', 'response to injury', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing']",NEI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2020,206250,0.10682298965521166
"Systems biology of quiescence entry Abstract This proposal aims to provide crucial training for the candidate’s long-term career plan to study how cellular quiescence is established through decision-making processes. The decision to undergo quiescence in response to stress or developmental signals is a fundamental and understudied property of living systems. Failure to maintain quiescence can lead to cell proliferation disorders in humans, such as fibrosis or cancer. Quiescence entry is triggered when multiple nutrient- and stress-sensing signaling pathways arrest the cell cycle machinery. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate stress response pathways with the cell cycle during quiescence remain largely unclear. This is, in part, due to the difficulties to simultaneously quantify multiple stress pathways at the single cell level in vivo. To solve this limitation, the candidate will use a microfluidics- fluorescent imaging system that tracks up to six different pathways simultaneously during the transition from proliferation into quiescence. Using this approach, the coordination between stress responses and the cell cycle machinery can be quantified with unprecedented temporal resolution in the model organism S. cerevisiae. A computational platform based on machine learning and time series analysis will be used to process the large imaging data derived from tracking six biomarkers simultaneously in single cells. An initial version of this framework found that during the onset of quiescence the nuclear levels of the conserved DNA-replication kinase Cdc7 are dynamically regulated. This approach also identified that the nuclear levels of the stress-activated transcriptional repressor Xbp1 define how the cell cycle is stopped during quiescence entry. Combining this computational approach with biochemical techniques will determine the molecular mechanisms for the establishment of cellular quiescence by modulation of stress responses and the cell cycle machinery. The candidate is to acquire crucial training in computational biology during the K99 phase of this proposal to complement his previous training in biochemistry, cell biology and yeast genetics. The candidate will be mentored by a leader in computational biology Dr. Gaudenz Danuser, whose lab develops advanced machine learning and time series analysis to study cellular signal transduction. This proposal harnesses the commitment of an entire bioinformatics core facility and the training environment of a world-class research institution at UTSW. Establishing a unique computational and imaging framework, combined with biochemical approaches for the study of quiescence, will support the candidate’s transition to an independent research academic position and will lead to the discovery of biomedically relevant principles of quiescence and cell cycle regulation. Narrative The precise integration of stress signals during the establishment of cellular quiescence is crucial to prevent cell proliferation disorders, such as fibrosis and cancer. However, it is unclear how stress responses are integrated during quiescence, in part, because of a lack of methods for simultaneously quantifying multiple stress pathways in single cells. To solve this problem, the proposed work will combine machine learning approaches with six color fluorescent microscopy to reveal the mechanisms by which stress responses coordinate quiescence.",Systems biology of quiescence entry,9870847,K99GM135487,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Carbon', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cellular biology', 'Color', 'Complement', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Core Facility', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In complete remission', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Meiosis', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Nitrogen', 'Nuclear', 'Nutrient', 'Nutrient Depletion', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Starvation', 'Stress', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcription Repressor', 'Work', 'XBP1 gene', 'anaphase-promoting complex', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'design', 'detection of nutrient', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'gene repression', 'genetic approach', 'imaging approach', 'imaging system', 'in vivo', 'prevent', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'yeast genetics']",NIGMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2020,95866,0.0709598461203139
Transfer learning approaches for integration of single cell RNA sequencing data from multiple sources Project Summary Neurobiology and Neurooncology are challenging fields of study due to the complexity of the brain as an organ as well as the difficulty in attaining human samples of brain tissue. These challenges have increasingly been addressed by the use of mouse models and molecular profiling that have uncovered complex sets of cell types. Fundamentally all cell types contain the same DNA but can be stratified by their RNA profile. This approach has taken advantage of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) which allows for single cells to be measured individually and for many cell types to be uncovered. In the past 5 years these experiments have become ever more prolific with large numbers of labeled datasets of single cells. These datasets can be used to explore a variety of questions involving the stratification of cell types to the distribution of these cell types in tissue. One of the most promising areas is the use of these cell types to better understand tumor heterogeneity and response to treatment. A promising avenue to leverage these diverse datasets for the study of heterogeneity is Transfer Learning. Transfer Learning is the subfield of Machine Learning that applies information learned from source data to target data to generate more generalizable or accurate models. We will develop methods to combine datasets into more robust models of tissue heterogeneity using transfer learning in both normal and Glioblastoma brain. These models can be used to predict clinical outcomes and study unique cellular relationships between datasets. Project Narrative The brain is a very complex organ with a wide variety of cell types -- the more granular of which have just recently been uncovered. We develop transfer-learning methods to integrate multiple datasets across species and disease states to glean information that will improve our understanding of the brain at the cellular level. We reframe Glioblastoma's genetic associations to survival as mixtures of quantifiable cell types effectively eliminating the “curse of dimensionality” via semi-supervised transfer-learning.,Transfer learning approaches for integration of single cell RNA sequencing data from multiple sources,9879629,F31LM013056,"['Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain Glioblastoma', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Glean', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurobiology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Psychological Transfer', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Supervision', 'Systematic Bias', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'clinically actionable', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'genetic association', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'multiple data sources', 'multiple data types', 'multiple datasets', 'neural network', 'neuro-oncology', 'predict clinical outcome', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NLM,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,12953,0.10846296462447444
"Finding emergent structure in multi-sample biological data with the dual geometry of cells and features    A fundamental question in biomedical data analysis is how to capture biological heterogeneity and characterize the complex spectrum of health states (or disease conditions) in patient cohorts. Indeed, much effort has been invested in developing new technologies that provide groundbreaking collections of genomic information at a single cell resolution, unlocking numerous potential advances in understanding the progression and driving forces of biological states. However, these new biomedical technologies produce large volumes of data, quantified by numerous measurements, and often collected in many batches or samples (e.g., from different patients, locations, or times). Exploration and understanding of such data are challenging tasks, but the potential for new discoveries at a level previously not possible justifies the considerable effort required to overcome these difficulties.  In this project we focus on multi-sample single-cell data, e.g., from a multi-patient cohort, where data points represent cells, data features represent gene expressions or protein abundances, and samples (e.g., considered as separate batches or datasets) represent patients. We consider a duality or interaction between constructing an intrinsic geometry of cells (e.g., with manifold learning techniques) and processing data features as signals over it (e.g., with graph signal processing techniques). We propose the utilization of this duality for several data exploration tasks, including data denoising, identifying noise-invariant phenomena, cluster characterization, and aligning cellular features over multiple datasets. Furthermore, we expect the dual multiresolution organization of data points and features to allow us to compute aggregated signatures that represent patients, and then provide a novel data embedding that reveals multiscale structure from the cellular level to the patient level.  The proposed research combines recent advances in several fields at the forefront of data science, including geometric deep learning, manifold learning, and harmonic analysis. The methods developed in this project will provide novel advances in each of these fields, while also establishing new relations between them. Furthermore, the challenges addressed by these methods are a foundational prerequisite for new advances in genomic research, and more generally in empirical data analysis where data is collected in varying experimental environments. The developed algorithms and methods in this project will be validated in several biomedical settings, including characterizing Zika immunity in Dengue patients, tracking progress of Lyme disease, and predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy. In this project we will develop new algorithms for biomedical data analysis that will characterize the complex spectrum of health states across various patient populations. These algorithms will leverage the large volumes of data collected by new biomedical technologies, focusing on single-cell data. Specific analysis will be carried out for characterizing Zika immunity in Dengue patients, tracking progress of Lyme disease, and predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy.",Finding emergent structure in multi-sample biological data with the dual geometry of cells and features   ,10022130,R01GM135929,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dengue', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Immunity', 'Immunotherapy', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Lyme Disease', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'ZIKA', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data exploration', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'driving force', 'multiple datasets', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient population', 'signal processing']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,353150,0.03654427749646858
"Molecular and biophysical mechanism of plasma membrane internalization during nonclathrin endocytosis During endocytosis, the cell's plasma membrane is deformed and internalized to bring in extracellular cargo and transmembrane receptors. Nonclathrin/noncaveolar (CLIC/GEEC) endocytosis internalizes glycosylated receptors and extracellular fluid, and is connected to cell polarity development, blebbing, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during cancer metastasis. A molecular and mechanical understanding of CLIC is necessary to understand how CLIC coordinates membrane curvature and actin polymerization to internalize the plasma membrane against membrane tension.  The primary limitation in studying CLIC has been the lack of unambiguous markers for the process. A machine learning approach used in Dr. Akamatsu's postdoctoral lab to classify bona fide endocytic events will be adapted to disambiguate markers for CLIC endocytosis relative to other types of endocytosis. This will define the first unique markers for CLIC and will reveal the order of protein assembly during CLIC membrane internalization, which is essential for understanding the function of each protein. To test the hypothesis that membrane tension controls CLIC progression, Dr. Akamatsu will combine lattice light-sheet microscopy with a calibration method he developed during his postdoctoral research to convert fluorescence intensity to numbers of molecules in live cells. With this new method, molecule-counting lattice light-sheet microscopy, he will measure the numbers of molecules of CLIC endocytic proteins at both the apical and basolateral surfaces of polarized iPS cells, which differ in their membrane tension. He will image the cells under osmotic stress to increase cellular membrane tension. Finally, to understand the feedback relationship between membrane curvature-sensing BAR proteins and actin polymerization during CLIC membrane internalization, he will incorporate membrane tubulation by BAR proteins and their reciprocal interactions with actin filament nucleation proteins into a multi-scale mathematical model developed during his postdoctoral work. Simulations of this model will predict the critical feedback relationships between plasma membrane curvature, tension and actin polymerization necessary for the timely completion of CLIC endocytosis. Predictions from the model will be tested in his own lab by imaging cells endogenously expressing protein domain truncations in the presence of inhibitors of actin nucleation and polymerization.  Dr. Akamatsu has a longstanding interest in combining physical modeling with live-cell quantitative experiments. One to two years of additional postdoctoral training will allow him to fully develop both skills in order to effectively implement a highly synergistic feedback loop in his own lab. Co-advising in experimental approaches by David Drubin and in computational modeling by Padmini Rangamani at UCSD have given him the foundation for this integrated approach. Additional training in theory from Padmini Rangamani and Hernan Garcia, and in quantitative experimental methods from Eric Betzig, Matt Welch, and Dan Fletcher will fully prepare him to lead an integrated modeling and experimental lab of his own. Cells respond to and control the tension of their plasma membrane by internalizing parts of their membrane through endocytosis, which regulates the number of receptors on the membrane. When this process is dysregulated, cells tend to lose the molecular identity of their membranes and become metastatic cancer cells, but the physical basis for this transition is not well-understood. This proposed project will combine live cell three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy with mathematical modeling to understand, on a molecular and mechanical level, how which cells regulate their membrane tension by bending and internalizing their plasma membranes during endocytosis.",Molecular and biophysical mechanism of plasma membrane internalization during nonclathrin endocytosis,9971541,K99GM132551,"['3-Dimensional', 'Actins', 'Address', 'Apical', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Calibration', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Characteristics', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clathrin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Development Polarity', 'Diploidy', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Extracellular Fluid', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Foundations', 'Gatekeeping', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microfilaments', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Physiological', 'Plasma Cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Role', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell motility', 'cellular imaging', 'epithelial to mesenchymal transition', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'fluorescence imaging', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'live cell imaging', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical model', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'polarized cell', 'polymerization', 'post-doctoral training', 'predictive modeling', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein function', 'receptor', 'receptor internalization', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cells', 'temporal measurement', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2020,96768,0.02410652203943505
"VISUALIZATION OF SUBCELLULAR DYNAMICS IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS Abstract Contemporary fluorescence microscopy connects our understanding of molecular events from biochemistry and structural biology with their activities in living cells. Lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM) has made it possible for us to track phenomena such as endocytic vesicle assembly or lipid kinase recruitment across an entire cell with high resolution, in both space and time, and with nearly single-molecule sensitivity. Development during the past year of lattice light sheet microscopy with adaptive optics (AO-LLSM) has overcome the optical limitations that have so far restricted most studies to individual cells in culture, allowing us to achieve comparable resolution and sensitivity in the complex optical environment of an intact, living, multicellular organism. It promises to bridge the gap between cells and organisms, through high sensitivity, volumetric imaging, with diffraction-limited resolution, of living tissues and developing embryos. We propose a research program in three overlapping stages: implementation of AO-LLSM (in collaboration with its developer), development of the new kinds of visualization and analysis software required by the scale and complexity of the datasets, and use of AO-LLSM to solve a problem in vertebrate development. To meet the computational challenges of analyzing the 4D data sets (from low signal-to-noise, the often non- punctate characteristics of the objects being studied, the temporally varying spatial complexity of the data, and the size of the data sets), we will develop new approaches using deep learning and related algorithms, with consultation from experts. As a paradigm application, we will study the consequences of Notch signaling and the related membrane-traffic and protein translocation events for cell differentiation in zebrafish early neurogenesis. AO-LLSM will for the first time allow us to relate molecular signaling events occurring on a timescale of seconds at cell interfaces to the ultimate fate of daughter cells many hours later. We therefore expect that in the course of resolving some long- standing issues in cell fate determination, we will develop microscopy approaches and computer visualization tools that are widely applicable to a range of model systems and biological questions. Narrative We will implement and apply a novel, live-cell imaging strategy (Lattice Light-Sheet Microscopy with Adaptive Optics: AO-LLSM) that spans, with diffraction-limited resolution, a range from molecules to tissues and from seconds to hours. We will use this new technology to study cell differentiation in the embryonic zebrafish brain, concentrating on how Notch-mediated signaling exerts long-range control over neuronal development. Obtaining accurate and comprehensive models of the underlying biology will require that we devise new and generalizable ways to display and analyze complex data sets, while overcoming the computational challenges posed by the low SNR of the imaging regime, the time-varying spatial complexity of the data, and the size of the data sets.",VISUALIZATION OF SUBCELLULAR DYNAMICS IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS,9872183,R35GM130386,"['Algorithms', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Embryo', 'Endocytic Vesicle', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Protein Traffic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Protein translocation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Zebrafish', 'adaptive optics', 'complex data ', 'daughter cell', 'deep learning', 'live cell imaging', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'new technology', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'recruit', 'single molecule', 'structural biology']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R35,2020,442500,0.06659359885476958
"Integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data Many projects have characterized the human brain transcriptome within and across cell types to better understand changes in RNA expression associated with brain development and aging, developmental or psychiatric brain disorders, and genetic variation. Large consortia, including psychENCODE, CommonMind and BrainSeq Consortiums, have primarily focused on the molecular profiling of RNA extracted from homogenate/bulk tissue from different brain regions across thousands of individuals. However, bulk tissue like the frontal cortex contains a mixture of different important cell populations, and failing to account for the underlying composition of tissue samples can cause both false positives and missed signal in differential expression analysis. Therefore, statistical methods referred to as ""cellular deconvolution"" have been developed that estimate the relative fractions of different cell types in bulk RNA-seq datasets. These cell fractions can then be used to control for differences in cell composition across bulk tissue samples and can better determine the cell type(s) that drive differential expression signal in bulk tissue data. However, these approaches require reference expression profiles from the underlying cell types that will be estimated, which can be difficult to generate from human postmortem brain tissue. Recent approaches have leveraged single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets to construct these reference profiles and perform cellular deconvolution, particularly in peripheral tissues. While many statistical or machine learning approaches have been proposed, the majority produce similar composition estimates for a given reference dataset. However, as we describe in this application, many of these existing reference datasets -regardless of the algorithm employed - are largely non- comparable to the vast majority of bulk RNA sequencing data generated from postmortem human brain tissue, and have produced incorrect estimates of cellular composition. Current algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the relative fraction of cell types. We therefore propose to generate a more comprehensive framework for performing cellular deconvolution in human postmortem RNA- seq data.This proposal will leverage the extensive bulk RNA sequencing performed over the past decade to better determine the relative role of cell type-specific expression in the human brain and their subsequent dysregulation in debilitating brain disorders. Recent approaches have leveraged single cell or nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to perform cellular deconvolution on homogenate datasets, but many current algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the relative fraction of cell types. This proposal therefore aims to develop novel reference and validation datasets necessary to implement cellular, and not RNA, deconvolution from RNA-seq datasets, which will become publicly available software. We will lastly apply this novel deconvolution approach to thousands of homogenate RNA-seq samples to identify cell type-specific insights into debilitating brain disorders.",Integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data,10007230,R01MH123183,"['Accounting', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Bioconductor', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cell Fraction', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nuclear', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'differential expression', 'excitatory neuron', 'frontal lobe', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'oligodendrocyte precursor', 'secondary analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical learning', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web app']",NIMH,"LIEBER INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2020,620747,0.05085719279853141
"Centrosome regulation of trafficking, ciliogenesis and cilia-dependent signaling PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Centrosomes are the central organizing centers of cells, performing essential functions for mitotic spindles and cilia. Diverse human diseases arise from defects to centrosomes because they impact both mitotic and ciliary functions. We discovered that cells from individuals with Down syndrome have both defective centrosomes and cilia. This opens an important new avenue for understanding the cell biological basis of Down syndrome. Because primary cilia loss is developmentally lethal, our studies will explore the role that subtle changes to centrosomes have in controlling cilia formation and function. Central to the reduced cilia function in Trisomy 21 cells, we discovered that elevated expression of the Pericentrin gene, encoded on chromosome 21, is necessary and sufficient to repress the movement of components required for both cilia formation and function from the cytoplasm to the centrosome and cilium. Pericentrin is a centrosome and intracellular trafficking scaffold protein that dramatically increases and decreases during the cell cycle, with levels lowest when cilia formation occurs and highest during mitosis. We propose that exquisite control of Pericentrin ensures cilia formation and function. However, we do not understand why the modest 1.5-fold increase in Pericentrin protein found in Down syndrome has such a profound impact on cilia. We will test how decreased and increased Pericentrin levels impact centrosomes, the interphase microtubule landscape, and satellite and vesicular trafficking, and what the consequent outcomes for cilia formation and signaling are. Excellent training opportunities exist for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the Pearson lab. We will continue to use and develop our rigorous training and experimental routines in alignment with the NIH guidelines for increasing rigor and reproducibility. Collaborations with other labs that specialize in electron microscopy and machine learning quantitative analyses will expand the innovation and impact of our studies of intracellular trafficking. In summary, this proposal will illuminate how the precise control of the human disease protein, Pericentrin, is coordinated with the cell cycle to ensure proper primary cilia formation and signaling required for normal development. This application aims to elucidate fundamental cell biological events in intracellular trafficking, cilia formation and cilia-dependent signaling that are commonly defective in human disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Down syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 and, like ciliopathy patients, individuals with Down syndrome display variably penetrant pathologies including cardiac septal defects, craniofacial dysmorphology and cognitive abnormalities. We discovered that Trisomy 21 and elevated gene dosage of the Pericentrin gene present on chromosome 21 inhibits cilia formation and signaling. Our research aims to determine the fundamental cellular basis for cilia defects in Down syndrome and how changes to Pericentrin levels tune centrosome structure, intracellular trafficking, ciliogenesis and cilia-dependent signaling during the cell cycle.","Centrosome regulation of trafficking, ciliogenesis and cilia-dependent signaling",10028106,R01GM138415,"['Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Stage', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Centrioles', 'Centrosome', 'Chromosome 21', 'Cilia', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Cytoplasm', 'Cytoplasmic Protein', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Down Syndrome', 'Dysmorphology', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Septal Defects', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interphase', 'Machine Learning', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic', 'Mitotic spindle', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scaffolding Protein', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tubulin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'cell assembly', 'ciliopathy', 'cilium biogenesis', 'craniofacial', 'dosage', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'overexpression', 'particle', 'pericentrin', 'recruit', 'scaffold', 'segregation', 'trafficking', 'training opportunity', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,306408,0.025117406402322885
"Role of the Snail1-Twist-p21 axis on cell cycle arrest and renal fibrosis development Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) such as kidney fibrosis are global health challenges. In the US alone CKD cost Medicare an estimated 50 billion dollars for patients with CKD age 65 and older in 2013. Recent studies revealed that after AKI renal epithelial cells undergo a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) and G2/M cell cycle arrest through a Snail1-Twist1-p21 axis; these cells secrete profibrotic factors and contribute to fibrosis progression. Therefore these three factors become promising potential drug targets for treating fibrosis, but further development requires addressing several outstanding open questions. The temporal sequence and causal relation between pEMT and cell cycle arrest is controversial, and the respective roles of Snail1, Twist1, and p21 on regulating pEMT and cell cycle arrest is unclear. Addressing these questions requires quantitative systems biology approaches beyond cell biology methods traditionally used in the field. In recent years my lab has made progression on deep learning based image automated analysis for live cell images, CRISPR-based gene editing, and mathematical modeling and other quantitative biology tools. These technological developments position us to tackle the above-mentioned challenging questions related to kidney fibrosis. Based on existing studies and our preliminary results, we hypothesize that there is a temporal order of the three factors, with p21 initializing G2/M arrest, which is reinforced by subsequent upregulation of Snail1; Snail1 also activates, and Twist1 further maintains the pEMT program; due to their temporally varying roles, effectiveness of targeting these factors depends on the timing of treatment. We will test the hypothesis with quantitative imaging studies using established cell lines and primary renal epithelial cells and mathematical analysis of competing models. In Aim 1, we will perform multi-color flow cytometry studies and time-lapse imaging studies on progression of cell cycle, EMT, and other cell fates of cells under stimulation. The two types of studies will provide complementary information on whether pEMT and cell cycle are tightly coupled, and will map out the temporal sequence of events of various cell fate change as well as correlation to expression levels of the three factors. In Aim 2, we will monitor the temporal profiles of these factors through fluorescence protein tagging in single cells, and use the data to evaluate an ensemble of models to identify one or a set of minimal network regulating EMT and G2/M arrest. We will then further examine the roles of individual factors through model analysis and a series of inhibition experiments. Success of the proposed research will provide mechanistic understanding of the regulatory network of cell cycle arrest and EMT in renal epithelial cells. The proposed research is our starting point for an emerging field of quantitative systems biology on kidney fibrosis. We expect that introducing quantitative approaches will greatly accelerate future development of treatment strategies on the increasing global health challenge imposed by progression of fibrosis, which currently lacks effective treatment. Kidney fibrosis is global health challenge with no effective treatment currently. Our proposed research will examine how two fibrosis contributing processes, cell cycle arrest and partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, are coupled. The research will lay foundation for developing novel dynamic strategies to treat kidney fibrosis through rescuing cells from cell cycle arrest.",Role of the Snail1-Twist-p21 axis on cell cycle arrest and renal fibrosis development,9834886,R01DK119232,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Color', 'Cost of Illness', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibrosis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'G2/M Arrest', 'Genes', 'Germ Cells', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Label', 'M cell', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tubular formation', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'epithelial to mesenchymal transition', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging study', 'kidney epithelial cell', 'kidney fibrosis', 'live cell imaging', 'loss of function', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'renal epithelium', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,341955,0.005428391609402279
"Resolving single-cell brain regulatory elements with bulk data supervised models Gene regulation is an important determinant of the complex specialization of cells in the human brain, and nucleotide changes within regulatory elements contribute to risk for psychiatric disorders. We therefore hypothesize that these debilitating diseases are driven in part by genetic variants that alter gene expression and disturb the balance and function of cell types in brain tissue. Single-cell open chromatin assays are a promising approach to testing this hypothesis by mapping variants to regulatory elements specific to and shared across cell populations. There are two major barriers to this strategy, for which our project proposes modeling solutions. First, despite being the best assay currently, single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) suffers from low resolution, meaning that an open chromatin region may be supported by zero or few reads in a given cell. This makes it hard to identify coherent cell populations. We propose a network model for semi-supervised clustering of cells in scATAC-seq that leverages information from higher-coverage bulk tissue experiments and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), if available. The expected outcomes from applying this model to compendia of brain data from public repositories and our collaborators are (i) identification of open chromatin regions that differentiate cell types and states, and (ii) discovery of resolved cell populations whose open chromatin is enriched for psychiatric disorder associated genetic variants. These results alone may not be enough to develop a mechanistic understanding of how variants impact brain function. To address this second challenge, we will implement a computationally efficient, machine-learning framework for predicting the specific regulatory functions of single-cell open chromatin regions from our network model and other approaches. Gene regulatory enhancers are particularly amenable to this approach, because high-throughput mouse transgenics and massively parallel reporter assays have generated enough validated enhancers for supervised learning. Our framework will be easy to apply to other regulatory functions, such as insulating boundaries in chromatin capture data. By developing a compressed, yet flexible, featurization of massive bulk and single-cell data compendia, we will enable rapid iteration with computationally intensive prediction algorithms to be applied to single-cell open chromatin regions. Our approach will also incorporate transfer learning from data-rich (e.g., postmortem or mouse brains) to data-poor settings (e.g., human late-gestation brains). We expect predicted regulatory elements to be more enriched for psychiatric disorder genetic risk, to provide mechanistic insight regarding how variants cause disease, and to be useful molecular tools. Together our two proposed computational approaches will leverage the complementary strengths of bulk and single-cell data to resolve regulatory elements that drive the exquisite diversity of cells in developing and adult brains towards mapping the non-coding contribution of psychiatric disease. The human brain is a complex tissue comprised of diverse cell types with distinct gene regulation and function, making it difficult to mechanistically link genetic mutations to differences in brain health. This project will develop a network model and machine-learning framework that leverage single-cell and bulk genomics data to identify genome sequences that control gene expression in specific cell populations and states. We hypothesize that these cell type resolved regulatory elements will shed light on how sequence variants outside protein-coding genes increase risk for psychiatric disorders.",Resolving single-cell brain regulatory elements with bulk data supervised models,10007660,R01MH123178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Censuses', 'Chickens', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neuraxis', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'XCL1 gene', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'egg', 'epigenomics', 'equilibration disorder', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'multiple data types', 'network models', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'promoter', 'psychiatric genomics', 'public repository', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'structured data', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'web server', 'whole genome']",NIMH,J.

"Understanding the control mechanisms of 3D cell migration from new dimensions Cell migration in 3D tissue space is of fundamental importance for human biology. However, predicting and programming 3D cell motility remain as major challenges despite of a firm picture of the molecular machineries involved. To fill the knowledge gap between the overwhelming subcellular details such as protein-protein interactions, and the fascinating dynamic patterns exhibited by different cell types in tissue spaces, I will focus on the mesoscale cellular dynamics, namely the migration mode transitions of cells in 3D extracellular matrix (ECM). My lab has developed deep-learning based image postprocessing to track the migration modes of cells. We also developed techniques to manipulate and measure the micromechanics of ECM at cellular scale. Based on these preliminary results, I will systematically study the intrinsic and extrinsic control mechanisms of 3D cell migration mode transitions in collagen ECM. The results will pave the way for my long-term goals to understand the organizing principle that lead molecules to life, and to program cell motility for applications in tissue engineering and cancer treatment. To this end, I will dedicate my lab to the following research thrusts. Thrust 1 aims to determine how cell migration mode transitions are regulated by external cues, as well as intrinsic states of cells during the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). I will test three hypotheses that elucidate the roles of ECM micromechanical stiffness, anisotropy, plasticity, synergy of mechanical and chemical guidance, as well as EMT stage in modulating the cell migration mode transitions. I will employ sophisticated ECM engineering and characterization techniques developed in my lab. I will also use genetically engineered cells whose EMT transcription factors are fluorescent labeled and can be specifically activated. Completion of thrust 1 will establish 3D cell migration as a hidden Markov process where the mesoscale dynamics, namely the migration mode transitions, provides a unifying framework to explain diverse dynamic patterns of 3D cell migration observed in vivo. Thrust 2 aims to devise strategies to program cell migration via nonstationary mechanical cues. In subproject 1, I will employ techniques developed in my lab to control 3D contact guidance cues in space and in real time. By measuring the migration mode transitions under step-increasing contact guidance, I will obtain the energy barriers that separate different modes. Then under periodic mechanical stimuli I will measure and computationally model the nonequilibrium mode transition flux, a statistical physics quantity that inform the efficiency and energy dissipation of cell motility responses. These mesoscale quantities shed light to the underlying molecular organizing principles. In subproject 2 I will develop collagen ECM which exhibits digital response to stresses using DNA-grafted nanoparticles as crosslinkers. I will design the DNA sequence to control the yield strength of crosslinkers, thereby programing cell migration mode both for single cell and for collective organoid migration. Completion of thrust 2 will expands the design space of engineered ECM, laying a foundation for the mechanical programing of 3D cell motility. 3D cell migration is of fundamental importance for both normal physiological processes such as in development, and disease progression such as cancer metastasis. Understanding the regulation and control mechanisms not only will advance our basic understanding of how cells mechanically interact with their environment, but will also lead to powerful strategies to facilitate therapeutic strategies in areas such as tissue regeneration, immune disorder and cancer.",Understanding the control mechanisms of 3D cell migration from new dimensions,10029282,R35GM138179,"['3-Dimensional', 'Anisotropy', 'Area', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collagen', 'Computer Models', 'Crosslinker', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Markov Chains', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mesenchymal', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Organoids', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Physics', 'Physiological Processes', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'fascinate', 'genetically modified cells', 'in vivo', 'migration', 'nanoparticle', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'synergism', 'tissue regeneration', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,352506,0.11916212722140725
"Quantitative protein network profiling to improve CAR design and efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY This grant is in response to PAR-18-206, Bioengineering Research Grants (BRG). Our goal is to adapt a cutting-edge proteomic network analysis platform, Quantitative Multiplex co-Immunoprecipitation or QMI, to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell signaling. We will then use CAR-QMI to characterize signal transduction network activation downstream of the CAR, to both understand how the CAR instructs a T cell to attack and destroy cancerous targets, and to make batch-specific predictions about efficacy and side-effect profiles of CAR T cell products. CAR T cells are a breakthrough anti-cancer therapy that recently won FDA approval for relapsed B cell lymphomas. A true “personalized medicine”, CAR T cells are manufactured for each patient from that patient's own T cells by transducing T cells collected by leukopheresis with a viral vector encoding a CAR. However, since each batch is unique, some batches perform better than others in terms of producing remissions and/or deleterious and sometimes fatal side effects including cytokine storms and neurotoxicity. The goal of this project is to develop a “personalized signal transduction network analysis platform” that can screen each batch of CAR T cells and predict the efficacy and side-effect potential of that specific batch. Because signal transduction networks integrate information from multiple input sources- for example costimulatory and immunosuppressive cell surface receptors, patient genetic background, and T-cell specific history of activation- we hypothesize that this readout will be a powerful predictor of function. Our preliminary data show that small changes in CAR design parameters such as scFV binding domain affinity produce measurable changes in signal transduction network state that correlate with functional variables such as target killing ability and cytokine release. Further, we show that there exists considerable individual-to- individual variation in batches of CAR T cells produced from different donors. Therefore, the two prerequisites for an individualized predictive assay are present- variation in our measurement across the population, and the functional relevance of our measurement to outcome parameters. Our interdisciplinary team consists of experts in CAR development, signal transduction, proteomics, and bioinformatics. Our ambitious but achievable goals are to expand the QMI panel to include CAR-specific components; to understand how CAR design parameters influence both signal transduction network states and functional performance measures; and to develop a predictive machine learning algorithm that translates QMI-derived signal transduction network states into a functional biomarker of in vivo clinical efficacy. Successful completion these aims will (1) identify specific proteins or protein interactions that determine clinically-relevant outcomes such as cytokine production or cell killing ability, allowing CAR designers to rationally modify the design of CARs to target specific signaling outcomes; (2) provide clinicians with a test to predict the clinical performance of CAR T cells on a batch-to- batch basis; and (3) provide the community with a novel analytical platform to measure CAR activity. PROJECT NARRARATIVE CAR T cells have the potential to recognize and specifically kill cancer cells, making them the target of extensive anti-cancer drug development research. This proposal will use a novel technology for monitoring the activation state of a T cell, a protein-interaction-network based approach called Quantitative Multiplex co-Immunoprecipitation, or QMI. Our goal is to identify a protein interaction network state indicative of clinical performance, and to better understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for CAR T cell efficacy.",Quantitative protein network profiling to improve CAR design and efficacy,9971201,R01CA240985,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'CD19 gene', 'CD22 gene', 'CD28 gene', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Co-Immunoprecipitations', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Fc Receptor', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'ITAM', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'K-562', 'Lead', 'Logic', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Recording of previous events', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'T-Cell Activation', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biosignature', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell behavior', 'cell killing', 'cell type', 'cellular transduction', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'computer infrastructure', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'leukemia', 'lymphoblast', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular modeling', 'nano-string', 'neurochemistry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotoxicity', 'new technology', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'side effect', 'transcriptome']",NCI,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,600156,0.055059482842577896
"Regulation of Cellular Proliferation by Novel Mitochondrial-Encoded Tumor Suppressors ABSTRACT Cellular compartments are coordinated through a dynamic bidirectional communication network amongst various organelles. Here, we focus on the communication between mitochondria and the nucleus, organelles that each possess their own genomes. The mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have co-evolved for over a billion years and have likely required close communication and cross-regulation. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by over 1,000 nuclear-encoded proteins, but there is currently no known mitochondrial-encoded factor that actively communicates to and regulates the nucleus. We have recently identified a novel gene encoded within the mitochondrial DNA and named it MOTS-c (Mitochondrial ORF within the Twelve S rRNA type-c). MOTS-c is a small 16 amino acid peptide that regulates metabolic homeostasis, in part, via the master nutrient sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase). We recently reported that MOTS-c can translocate into the nucleus in response to metabolic stress to bind to chromatin and regulate nuclear gene expression. Further, our preliminary study using a multi-pronged approach, including single cell RNA-seq, bioinformatics (including machine learning), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR), and cell sorting, showed that MOTS-c can regulate cellular proliferation; MOTS-c targeted the p53/p21 pathway and ribosomal processes. Considering the important metabolic role of mitochondria in cellular proliferation processes (29), a critical question that remains largely enigmatic is how mitochondrial-encoded factors communicate to the nucleus to coordinate the metabolic shift with gene expression during proliferation. Notably, rapidly dividing cancer cells had undetectable levels of MOTS-c or nuclear-translocation deficiency, suggesting loss of mito-nuclear communication by MOTS-c. Together, cancer may be a genetic disease in which our two genomes exist in a state of disrupted bi-directional communication/regulation, and may serve as a unique model to start understanding the role of MOTS-c in cellular proliferation. Because MOTS-c expression/function was dysregulated and that MOTS-c can negatively regulate cell cycle/proliferation, we hypothesize that MOTS-c is a mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressor, the first of its kind to be identified, that directly regulates the nucleus to coordinate cellular metabolism with proliferation. We propose three aims to test this hypothesis. First, we will characterize MOTS-c as a tumor suppressor that regulates cell proliferation at the molecular, cellular, genetic level. Second, we will comprehensively map the MOTS-c-dependent functional nuclear genomic landscape using multiple complimentary genomics approach, including single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility), and genomic footprinting using ChIP-seq. The data from each genomic approach will be integrated using cutting-edge computational methods, including machine learning, to decipher the message(s) MOTS- c delivers to the nuclear genome to regulate cancer cell proliferation and survival. Lastly, we will determine how MOTS- c-mediated communication to the nucleus can differentially regulate cellular proliferation and stress resistance in normal and malignant cells using mouse models of cancer. If successful, we predict that our study will have broad and lasting impact on (i) basic research by introducing the paradigm-shifting concept of mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressors that coordinate cellular metabolism and proliferation and (ii) therapeutic development by revealing mtDNA as a source of novel drug targets (currently there are no FDA-approved drugs based on the mitochondrial genome). PROJECT NARRATIVE Key cellular functions, such as proliferation, require the coordination of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes through dynamic bi-directional communication. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by many nuclear-encoded proteins, the nucleus has traditionally been not considered to be actively regulated by mitochondrial-encoded factors. We propose to study how a novel tumor suppressor peptide encoded in the mitochondrial genome that we identified directly regulates the nuclear genome to coordinate cellular metabolism and proliferation.",Regulation of Cellular Proliferation by Novel Mitochondrial-Encoded Tumor Suppressors,9944175,R01GM136837,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adenosine Monophosphate', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Bacteria', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cancer Model', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Stress', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Diet', 'Electron Transport', 'Endothelium', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'In Vitro', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Language', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Normal Cell', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Translocation', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organelles', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'age related', 'antitumor effect', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell type', 'chemotherapy', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'exhaustion', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'immune function', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'loss of function', 'mitochondrial genome', 'mouse model', 'muscle metabolism', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'therapeutic development', 'tumor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,326942,0.00926861663560225
"Identifying immunotherapy targets against thymus B cells in AChR myasthenia gravis (MG) Project Summary Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder caused by autoantibodies that disrupt components of neuromuscular junctions, such as the acetylcholine receptor (AChR, 90% of patients). Rituximab (RTX) is a B cell depleting agent used in the management of an increasingly wide range of autoimmune diseases; many AChR MG patients achieve remission after RTX but relapse following treatment cessation is common. The thymus is a known reservoir of B cells that can produce pathogenic anti-AChR antibodies and resection of the thymus has long been known to improve MG symptoms; however, many patients also fail to achieve complete remission after thymectomy. In both cases, we conclude that the failed depletion of B cells relevant to disease may be driving poor responses. Developing systemic immunotherapy to better target B cells that escape depletion is therefore of critical importance for effective MG treatment. Characterizing the features of B cells that re-emerge after RTX depletion in MG would further the development of more effective treatments for MG and lead to a deeper understanding of the immuno-pathophysiology behind the disorder. The overall goal of this project is to characterize the transcriptional features of disease-relevant B cells from patients who experienced poor outcomes from two randomized clinical trials on the use of rituximab and thymectomy for the treatment of AChR MG. Our laboratory recently developed a method called single cell tracing of adaptive immune repertoires (STAIR) that allows for the unbiased identification and transcriptional characterization of autoantigen-specific B cells that escape RTX depletion by combining high-depth bulk repertoire sequencing methods with single cell gene expression and repertoire analysis. For this proposal, I will apply this approach to investigate the single cell gene expression characteristics of B cells from the thymus that persist in the circulation of patients who underwent thymectomy (Goal 1), and the characteristics of B cells associated with poor clinical responses to RTX (Goal 2). We will test the hypothesis that B cells shared with the thymus will have a similar single cell transcriptional identity as those that fail to be depleted by RTX: we expect that they will be clonally expanded IgG-switched ASCs with specificity for autoantigen. This fellowship integrates a training plan that will include invaluable learning experiences in machine learning and the latest NGS technology This training plan will enhance the applicant's goal of becoming a physician scientist at the interface of clinical medicine and science. Project Narrative: Rituximab (RTX) is a B cell depleting therapy approved for the treatment of an increasing number of autoimmune disorders; however, we observed that a significant fraction of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients relapsed despite early remission with RTX, a phenomenon observed in the context of other RTX-treated autoimmune disorders as well. This proposal will investigate the mechanism of relapse after B cell depleting therapy in MG by using novel single-cell tracing of adaptive immune repertoire (STAIR) analysis to study samples from two completed randomized clinical trials (BeatMG, MGTX). This experience will also provide invaluable computational and experimental training and new learning for the applicant.",Identifying immunotherapy targets against thymus B cells in AChR myasthenia gravis (MG),10068690,F31AI154799,"['Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological Products', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Cholinergic Receptors', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clone Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Targeting', 'Excision', 'Fc Receptor', 'Fellowship', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin-Secreting Cells', 'Immunotherapy', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Myasthenia Gravis', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular Junction', 'Nicotinic Receptors', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Procedures', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Recombinant Antibody', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thymectomy', 'Thymus Gland', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Visual', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'relapse patients', 'response', 'rituximab', 'single cell sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,30330,0.10075094663180072
"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular signatures of human neurons we identify can be used to provide insights into the molecular factors that distinguish central neurons from healthy people from those of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, SMA, PD and HD. These insights will provide molecular targets that can be used to develop new drugs to block the progression of these diseases which are presently untreatable.",Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells,10095893,U54NS091046,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Network-based', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Online Systems', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Scourge', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'data tools', 'disease-causing mutation', 'epigenomics', 'genome sequencing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach program', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'statistics', 'stem cell technology', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,U54,2020,600000,0.08821222879734916
"Systems Analysis of cell type differentiation in Xenopus development Summary The pathways involved in embryonic development have been a rich resource for understanding disease in adults, as well as being critically important in tracing the effects of genetic lesions and environmental poisons in the fetus. Frog embryos have been particularly useful due to the large size of the frog egg and embryo. New tools we developed for measuring the expression of RNA at a single-cell level, and advances in protein and phosphopeptide measurement technologies, offer hope for dramatic progress in understanding how signals involved in the maturation of the embryo direct individual cells to adopt specific fates. Our first goal is to define cell types using single-cell transcriptomics, and to define the lineages that result in specific cell types using high resolution temporal mappings. Targeted transcriptomics and proteomics of important molecules involved in specifying cell fate, such as transcription factors, will provide an index of the levels of signaling activity in each individual cell. This will result in an unprecedentedly detailed molecular picture of the factors involved in producing the phenotypes, and their interconversions from the early cleavage stage to the middle of organogenesis. The Xenopus model system allows us to dissect out portions of the early embryo that differentiate to ectoderm if not disturbed, called the animal cap. In the context of the embryo the cells in the animal cap receive a number of developmental signals, including Nodal, BMP, and Wnt. Combinations of these three signals (in different proportions) are capable of generating many of the major tissues. We will expose animal caps to a matrix of these three signals and trace the differentiation pathways that result, using single-cell RNA sequencing. This study of the molecular roots of differentiation decisions will be used to develop a mathematical approach, based on machine learning, to predicting the results of an attempted perturbation of the development of Xenopus. We will ask whether cell types are carefully specified by tightly controlled combinations of ligands or whether there are default states that are hard to escape from (""basins of attraction""), that therefore form the majority of embryonic cell types. The answer to this question is central to our understanding of how the Xenopus embryo reliably develops into a frog, and will accelerate efforts to create computational methods to predict the behavior of other biological pathways such as those involved in cancer. Narrative The complexity of biology makes it hard to predict what effect a mutation or a drug will have. We will use new tools to measure when genes are expressed at the individual cell level throughout the course of development of a vertebrate embryo. This will give us new information on the cell types involved in tissue and organ formation, and will provide an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that we will use to develop a mathematical model of how the decision to become a specific cell type is made.",Systems Analysis of cell type differentiation in Xenopus development,9939535,R01HD073104,"['Activins', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Animal Cap', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm Cell', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Nodal', 'Organ', 'Organogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylated Peptide', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plant Roots', 'Poison', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'RNA library', 'Rana', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrometry', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Xenopus', 'Xenopus laevis', 'base', 'blastomere structure', 'cell type', 'cluster computing', 'course development', 'egg', 'embryo cell', 'experimental study', 'hatching', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'notochord', 'novel', 'phosphoproteomics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'single cell proteins', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'vertebrate embryos', 'xenopus development']",NICHD,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,630909,0.12217143957684935
"Predicting Post-treatment Relapse in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia Using Single-cell Proteomics Project Summary  Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the most lethal hematologic malignancy in childhood, with a probability of 5-year survival at only 60%. Most children diagnosed with AML initially respond well to standard chemotherapy; however, nearly 40% eventually develop relapsed disease, which responds poorly to treatment and is fatal in the majority of patients. Although age at diagnosis, response to induction chemotherapy, and cytogenetic status have been identified as coarse prognostic factors in pediatric AML, it is still unclear what molecular features lead certain patients to relapse over others. Thus, developing an enhanced understanding of the mechanistic drivers underlying relapse in pediatric AML represents a significant area of clinical need.  Many reports indicate that there are rare, hematopoietic stem cell-like subpopulations in AML patients that resist chemotherapy and drive relapse. However, the exact characteristics of these relapse-associated cells—often called “leukemic stem cells” (LSCs)—are a matter of contention, with reported phenotypes spanning much of the known hematopoietic developmental continuum and differing significantly between patients and throughout the course of disease. As such, the identity and importance of these relapse-associated cells as well as their relationship to normal hematopoietic developmental processes remain mysterious.  The proposed project will examine the relationship between single-cell AML phenotypes, clinical outcomes, and normal myeloid development in 60 clinically-annotated primary samples from pediatric AML patients in order to identify relapse-associated cellular subtypes. To achieve this, we will leverage the versatility of mass cytometry, a 40-parameter single-cell proteomics platform, and machine learning in simultaneously studying the complex surface and signaling phenotypes of millions of leukemic cells from patients’ diagnostic and relapse bone marrow samples relative to healthy controls. Central hypothesis: We hypothesize that high-dimensional molecular profiling of primary AML cells will reveal consistent, functional phenotypes associated with relapse-driving subpopulations that computationally align with particular stages of healthy hematopoietic development and represent points of future therapeutic intervention. Aim 1: Develop methods to computationally align high-dimensional, single-cell AML phenotypes with their  most analogous developmental state along the healthy myeloid continuum. Aim 2: Utilize predictive modeling to determine the surface, signaling, and functional phenotype of AML  subpopulations predicting relapse and functionally validate these characteristics in vitro and in vivo. Project Narrative: For reasons that remain poorly understood, nearly 40% of the roughly 500 children diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) each year in the United States will experience relapse after initially responding to treatment. To better characterize why some AML patients relapse while others do not, the proposed project will use state-of-the-art molecular profiling approaches to characterize millions of primary AML cells and their computational “alignment” with healthy hematopoietic development. These data will be used to construct a method of predicting at diagnosis which patients have a high risk of relapse in order to identify prognostically important cell populations that represent future therapeutic targets in the management of pediatric AML.",Predicting Post-treatment Relapse in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia Using Single-cell Proteomics,9994724,F31CA239365,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cox Models', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Event', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Future', 'Graph', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Myeloid Leukemia', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'STAT3 gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'acute myeloid leukemia cell', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'chemotherapy', 'design', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cell', 'molecular subtypes', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'stem-like cell', 'therapeutic target']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,39490,0.06953494116634622
"Multiscale Resolution and Deep Network Approaches for Deconvolving Different Cell Types in Bulk Tumor using Single-cell Sequencing Data (scDEC) Abstract  Brain tissue is composed of heterogeneous cell populations. Understanding the changes in brain cell type or state composition during neurodegeneration have important implications for future treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For example, microglia cell development (scRNA-Seq) brain. including poorly type specific gene expression changes occur early in the of AD. Over the past few years, the development and application of single-cell RNA sequencing have revolutionized brain research thus enabling us to study the cellular heterogeneity of the With the advent of scRNA-Seq, we can now identify healthy and diseased brain cell types or states rare cell type or state populations and identify transcriptional alterations within these cell groups. addition to the cellular complexity of the AD, the molecular complexity of the disease also remains understood. In Until now, studies have identified numerous germline genomic variants associated with susceptibility to AD. However, from level identification of somatic example, However, brain healthy and diseased scRNA-Seq data DNA alterations that are distinct the germline, term referred as `brain somatic genomic mosaicism'. Brain somatic variants occur at a low- allele frequency, which could only be detected using single-cell DNA sequencing. C variants For sporadic AD the copy number of APP gene is mosaically increased in single neuron cells. it is challenging to characterize these somatic variants since there is a lack of AD brain or healthy single-cell DNA sequencing data. Therefore, there is a great value in utilizing to investigate somatic mosaicism in single brain cells and brain cells, especially neurons, harbor diverse omprehensive in brain cells will explain the contribution of somatic mosaicism to AD. in the growing number of identify genomic variants that are associated with susceptibility to AD.  In this proposal, we describe a novel deep network approach for deconvolving different cell types or states in bulk AD sample using single-cell RNA sequencing data. Our approach will estimate not only the ratio of cell types or states but also the ratio of somatic clonal mosaicism in AD samples using scRNA-Seq data. We define somatic clonal mosaicism as the groups of cells, i.e. clones, harboring somatic genomic variants such asCNVs, SNPs, or indels.

"Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on “manual gating” of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 – Implement a novel computational infrastructure – FlowGate – for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 – Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 – Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 – Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community. Project Narrative Flow cytometry analysis is widely used for single cell phenotyping in the translational research lab to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes and in the clinical diagnostic lab for the identification and classification of blood-borne malignancies. However, the current practice for cytometry data analysis using “manual gating” based on two-dimensional data plots is subjective, labor-intensive and unreliable, especially when using more complex high content staining panels.

"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers. Our goal is to show that the proposed multi-tissue platform can replicate the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients, and be used to develop better therapeutic regimens.",Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies,10004647,UH3EB025765,"['Address', 'Age', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Blood Substitutes', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Endothelium', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Myopathy', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Protective Agents', 'Proteins', 'Regimen', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Source', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'bone', 'circulating microRNA', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'drug testing', 'imaging modality', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication safety', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic target']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,UH3,2020,1000,0.018077887928762224
"Multi-Omic Single-Cell System for Improved Combination Cancer Immunotherapy Monitoring and Implementation IsoPlexis proposes to deliver a novel multi-omic method for targeted profiling of both the TCR sequence and proteome from an array of 1000+ single cells. Specifically, we will deliver a single-cell, TCR sequencing and protein capture assay for identifying responsive antigen specific TCRs, and concurrently evaluate these T-cells for functional response to that antigen. The challenge remains to link the activation of quiescent T-cell embedded in tumors by combination immunotherapies to patient outcome. Determining the combination of therapies to which each individual patient best responds indicates the best course of treatment. The quality of single-cell polyfunctional response of these immune cells correlates to positive outcomes far better than traditional bulk analysis. For example, PD-1 is upregulated upon T-cell activation while PD-L1 is expressed by a range of cell types. Since PD-1/PD-L1 interactions negatively regulate T cell immune function, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade can rescue effector T cell function. Critical to analyzing TILs is to assess (1) these T-cells’ function in the tumor environment in order to enable trial leaders to predict responders vs non-responders, a critical problem in immuno-oncology, and (2) to understand the TCR Sequence of the highest functioning cells. IsoPlexis single- cell secretion analysis exceeds its competition in the generation and quantitation of highly-multiplexed, single- cell data. Additional single-cell data from the TCR sequence would help to link antigen specificity to polyfunctional T cells involved in patient response, for improved biomarkers and targeted T-cell therapy development. We propose the following specific aims: (1) develop SCBC flow cell for the dual capture of multiplexed proteins and transcriptome on-device. (2a) produce a miniaturized and benchtop automated instrument of the existing instrument for multi-omic applications. 2b) develop a software suite for automated data processing and intuitive integrated informatics of polyfunctional and transcriptome data. 3) Establish patient learning of phenotype & genotype information in multiple trials, applied with machine learning of large patient genotype/phenotype data. At the end of our Phase II grant, we will demonstrate a dual TCR/proteomic assay on a fully-automated miniaturized SCBC instrument, the IsoMini, and software suite that will be successfully used across three combination therapy trials at Yale, Stanford and Fred Hutch. As successes in personalized medicine have continued to move the field forward, there is a growing need to predict responder differences in combination cancer therapies. The challenge remains to link the activation of quiescent T-cell embedded in tumors (TILs) by combination immunotherapies to patient outcome. IsoPlexis automated high-throughput platform using highly-multiplexed, single-cell measurements allows the simultaneous identification of both antigen specificity by TCR sequencing and functional effects by polyfunctional cytokine secretion. This would allow clinicians to finally have a tool to identify the specific TCR of the highest responding TILs necessary for the effective development of combination therapies.",Multi-Omic Single-Cell System for Improved Combination Cancer Immunotherapy Monitoring and Implementation,9982278,R44CA243949,"['Algorithms', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Antigens', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Count', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell secretion', 'Cells', 'Combination immunotherapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Immunooncology', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'PD-L1 blockade', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T cell response', 'T cell therapy', 'T-Cell Activation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cell type', 'combination cancer therapy', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'effective therapy', 'effector T cell', 'genotyped patients', 'immune function', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'miniaturize', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'software development', 'standard care', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NCI,"ISOPLEXIS, INC.",R44,2020,988980,0.03972640093042365
"A knowledge graph framework for automated gating analysis of cytometry data Project Summary / Abstract Flow and mass cytometry provide multiparametric single-cell data critical for understanding the cellular heterogeneity in various biological systems. Modern polychromatic flow cytometers simultaneously measure about 16 parameters routinely. The next-generation mass cytometry (CyTOF) technology allows for the simultaneous measurement of 50 or more parameters. Even as the cytometry technology is rapidly advancing, approaches for analyzing such complex data remain inadequate. The widely-used manual gating analysis is knowledge-driven and easy-to- interpret, but it is subjective, labor-intensive, and not scalable to handle the increasing complexity of the data. Recent developments of automated data-driven algorithms are able to address the issues of manual gating, but the results from data-driven algorithms are often not intuitive for biology experts to interpret. These limitations create a critical bottleneck for flow and mass cytometry analysis. The overall objective of this application is to develop a novel framework that combines both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches to achieve automated gating analysis of flow cytometry and CyTOF data. The specific aims are: (1) build knowledge graphs to capture existing knowledge of manual gating analysis, (2) develop algorithms for automated gating analysis, and (3) validate the knowledge graph framework using large-scale studies in ImmPort. The proposed research is significant because it will enable efficient and reproducible gating analysis and provide visualizations that are easy-to-interpret, both of which are critically important to the research community. Such contributions will fundamentally impact single-cell analysis of cellular heterogeneity in diverse fields including immunology, infectious diseases, cancer, AIDS, among others.

"Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit Abstract Since Ramon y Cajal, neuroscientists have speculated that even the most complex brain functions might even- tually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. More recently, while we have be- gun to understand the wiring principles of cortical microcircuit in rodents at the level of cell types, we are still in infancy in understanding the circuit organization of the primate neocortex at the level of cell types and their connections, slowing the progress toward a mechanistic understanding of complex cognitive capabilities char- acteristic of primates. For instance, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of the primate brain is the most evolutionarily developed brain region that supports complex cognitive processes characteristic of primates, such as reasoning, planning, and abstract thinking. However, we know little about the constituent cell types comprising DLPFC circuit, how each cell type connects each other to form a functional circuit, and what circuit components specific to this circuit endow it with superb computational capabilities for complex cognitive pro- cesses. To fill in this knowledge gap, we scale up a cost-effective, interdisciplinary approach to macaque DLPFC, aiming at identifying all its consitiuent cell types and decipher their connectivity rules, with emphasis on highly diverse GABAergic interneurons. We propose to use multi-cell patch recordings, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), novel and rapid viral GABAergic labeling, and machine learning to achieve two main goals: 1) dissect macaque DLPFC microcircuit by generating a morphological taxonomy of cell types in DLPFC and mapping their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of morphologically defined DLPFC neurons using Patch-seq method, a novel scRNA-seq protocol. We have demonstrated the feasibility and suc- cess of this approach in mouse neocortex, and our preliminary data indicate no technical issue in applying this approach to primates. Using multi-cell patch recordings, we will characterize electrophysiology and morphology of thousands of neurons and map connections between tens of thousands of cell pairs from DLPFC. Using Patch-seq method, we will combine patch recording with a novel/sensitive scRNA-seq method (Smart-seq2) to simultaneously obtain electrophysiology, morphology and transcriptome from single neurons, which can further substantiate cell type classification and identify novel molecular markers for each cell type. We will prioritize our effort on superficial layers of DLPFC, but eventually scale up our efforts to all layers if time permits. At the end, the project will uncover a high-resolution microcircuit blueprint of macaque DLPFC with each circuit com- ponent identified by specific genetic markers. Such a comprehensive dataset will provide the essential ground- work to design molecular tools for further functional dissection of the complex cognitive processes subserved by PFC. From a clinical perspective, having reference transcriptomes and connectivity patterns for different cell types in primate DLPFC will facilitate our understanding of the relationship between disease-associated genes, cell types, and circuit deficits in neuropsychiatric diseases, schizophrenia in particular. Narrative The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the primate is the most evolutionarily developed brain structure mediating complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates, such as reasoning and planning, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer disease. Despite its vital importance, we currently know very little about the constituent cell types populating the primate PFC and how they are wired together to mediate complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates. We propose to use a cost-efficient, multidisciplinary approach to decipher the cell type-specific wiring principles of the monkey PFC circuit at an unprecedented scale and level of detail, which could lead to a better circuit-level mechanistic understanding of complex functions subserved by primate PFC and more effective strategies for the treatment of devastating disorders, such as schizophrenia.",Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit,9961670,R01MH120404,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Goals', 'Guns', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injections', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physical shape', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'cell type', 'cognitive capacity', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'cortex mapping', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'neocortical', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'patch sequencing', 'preservation', 'scale up', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'ward']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,400938,0.04034494532702682
"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE MC-IU effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing, exploration, and download of different types of tissue and individual cell data. The CCF will use different visual interfaces in order to exploit human and machine intelligence to improve data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, biology, and biomedical data standards. The goal is to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimensional spatial basemap of the human body with associated data overlays. This basemap will be designed for online exploration as an atlas of tissue maps composed of diverse cell types, developed in close collaboration with the HIVE MC-NYGC team. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across multiple levels (whole body, organ, tissue, cells). MC-IU will work in close collaboration with the HIVE Infrastructure and Engagement Component (IEC) and tools components (TCs) to connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources driven by spatial context. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an extensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spatial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical. This project will work in close coordination with the HuBMAP consortium to help drive an ecosystem of useful resources for understanding and leveraging high-resolution human image data and to compile a human body atlas.","The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector and Meta Datasets",10148333,OT2OD026671,"['Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecosystem', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Organ', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Tissues', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'data exploration', 'data standards', 'design', 'human imaging', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'tool', 'vector']",OD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,OT2,2020,1000000,0.0129354140457015

"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary We request a high-flux x-ray source and to acquire new team expertise in segmentation from microCT images, in order to apply a new 3D form of histology developed through our parent R24 to begin to characterize the cellular and tissue geometries of COVID-19-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) pneumonia, our pandemic’s most common cause of death. Our novel imaging tool, X-ray histotomography, is based on microCT of fixed and metal-stained tissue. It is unique among 3D imaging methods as the only nondestructive way to achieve pan-cellular imaging (allowing characterization of all cell types and tissues) and is potentially practical. Histotomography uniquely allows direct comparison with today’s 2D standard of tissue diagnosis, histology, capable of producing both 3D renderings and undistorted 2D slices at any angle and any slice thickness. Unlike histology, we will also allow us to precisely characterize cellular arrangements into tissues after fixing and staining of samples with metal. The ability to volumetrically characterize cell types and their arrangements in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is particularly important because it is what kills most patients in coronavirus-based pandemics, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in 2003, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in 2012, COVID-19 now. The proposed work will increase our preparedness for future pandemics. ARDS lungs are an ideal human tissue model for mathematically defining human disease because all cell types are affected. The proposed work with COVID-19 lungs will increase the precision with which we understand the different stages of coronavirus lung infection and serve as a model for characterizing the Geometry of Disease across all organ systems. Histotomography in the parent R24 is currently limited to animal models, focusing on the zebrafish. The supplement will allow us to translate our work to human health, which was originally envisioned by the PI, as part of defining the “Geometry of Disease”. Our experience with this technology tells us that we will be able to characterize the numbers of each of the basic inflammatory cell types, including lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages (which are morphologically distinct) in terms of numbers, volumes, shapes, and density in the inflamed tissue, and to also characterize the changes in the lung epithelia (bronchial ciliated epithelial cells and pneumocytes, cell death, and the filling of airways with fluid and fibrinous exudate, and vascular inflammation. In addition to quantitation of tissue changes, we will also be able to visualize pathological change in the tissues using virtual reality. Histotomography will serve as a way to validate a humanized mouse model of COVID-19 infection by comparing the quantitative changes with those in human autopsy samples. We will be comparing both standard histological sections and histotomographic images from adjacent tissue. Machine learning will ultimately allow us to automate recognition of cell types and pathological change. The proposed augmentation of our instrumentation and expertise will facilitate definitions of the “Geometry of Disease” across organ systems. Project narrative We request an equipment upgrade and acquisition of expertise to accelerate progress and to pilot the translational use of our ORIP-funded technology to provide the first 3D understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Histotomography, a new 3D form of histology based on microCT, is the first practical way to turn the current standard of 2D, qualitative, tissue analytics into quantitative, morphometrics that is inclusive of all cell types and tissue architecture. Organismal and tissue phenotyping at both scales makes possible the first 3D, complete phenotyping of cells and tissue architecture, promising to transform human tissue diagnostics, preclinical toxicology, and more comprehensive high-throughput genetic, chemical and disease phenomics.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),10169023,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Alveolar', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biology', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Volumes', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Control Animal', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Female', 'Floods', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung infections', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Metals', 'Microscopy', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Negative Staining', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumonia', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readiness', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Synchrotrons', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'body system', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'computational basis', 'density', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human imaging', 'human morbidity', 'human mortality', 'human tissue', 'humanized mouse', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'macrophage', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'microCT', 'mouse model', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'parent project', 'phenomics', 'pneumocyte', 'pre-clinical', 'reconstruction', 'submicron', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'vascular inflammation', 'virtual reality']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2020,655483,0.06036040821043865
"EFFICIENT METHODS FOR CALIBRATION, CLUSTERING, VISUALIZATION AND IMPUTATION OF LARGE scRNA-seq DATA Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiling provides an unprecedented opportunity to conduct detailed cellular analysis of cell subpopulations. Fulfilling the promise of scRNA-seq for biomedical studies and biomarker discovery requires robust computational approaches to support detection of rare phenotypes and unanticipated cellular responses. Current approaches for imputation, calibration, clustering and visualizing of scRNA-seq data suffer from challenges such as erroneous imputing of non-expressed genes, limitation of linear assumptions in removal of multivariate batch effects, and inefficiencies of clustering and dimensional reduction methods of very large datasets. We have developed spectral, neural network, and Fast Multipole Methods (FMM) prototypes suitable for addressing these issues in the context of scRNA-seq and other high throughput data contexts and propose to further develop and adapt these methods to scRNA-seq data analysis. Our team of experts on data analytics and computational biology is currently funded through the NIH BD2K initiative to develop novel big data tools and methods that have broad applicability to biomedical science. This effort proved the feasibility of extremely efficient scalable prototypes of neural network, spectral, and harmonic analysis techniques suitable for calibrating, reducing the dimensionality and visualizing high dimensional data, finding intrinsic state-probability densities, and co-organizing cells, markers and samples. We propose substantial advances over existing analytical procedures used in single cell RNA-seq studies including matrix recovery approaches for the sparse and noisy scRNA-seq data by combining matrix completion and statistical techniques (Aim 1A), and calibration based on our unsupervised MMD-ResNet neural network prototype and optimal transport theory (Aim 1B). We will develop a variant of the FMM approach to speed up the calculation of the repulsion term of the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique, which will improve our current fastest t-SNE FFT-based FIt-SNE prototype, and develop new reliable approximate nearest neighbors approaches to speed up the computation of the attraction term of t-SNE and other clustering algorithms (Aim 2A). Our additional variants of t-SNE will be further developed to allow better separation between clusters of cell subpopulations (late exaggeration) and better visualization using 1D t-SNE for heatmap gene-cell representation (Aim 2A). We will adapt SpectralNet, our efficient neural network approach, for computing graph Laplacian eigenvectors for large datasets. This will enable computation of spectral clustering, diffusion maps and manifold learning that are utilized in many scRNA studies but are currently limited to a moderate number of single cells (Aim 2B). Finally, we will develop a kernel based differential abundance algorithm to characterize differences between biological conditions (Aim 2C). We will adopt appropriate sampling approaches to significantly improve current methods. This research plan aims at developing scalable spectral computational and neural network tools suitable for analyzing very large single cell RNA sequencing datasets. Specifically, our team which is led by a computational biologist, two prominent applied mathematicians and two prominent biologists will develop and validate scalable and novel techniques for: (i) completing missing values prevalent in these measurements, (ii) removing batch effect, (iii) reducing dimensionality and visualizing very large single cell RNA sequencing datasets and enabling detection of rare cell populations as well as detecting minute changes of cell populations between biological conditions.

"Spatially Resolved Dynamics of Molecular Pathology and Intercellular Interactions in Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis Project Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease in which the loss of upper (primary motor cortex, M1) and lower (spinal cord, SC) motor neurons (MNs) ultimately leads to total paralysis. MN loss in ALS involves cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous activities in multiple cell types of the M1 and SC, the organization of which are well understood. However, there remain 4 major gaps in our knowledge: 1) How ALS-associated molecular pathology in the various cell types of the M1 relates to those in the SC; 2) How subpopulations of specific cell types are spatially arranged in these two regions; 3) How subpopulations of different cell types are organized in higher-order ensembles; and 4) How the coordinated behavior of these ensembles relates to disease-associated molecular pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). Towards addressing these questions, we propose to develop a spatially resolved multi-omics catalog of cellular subpopulations in the M1 and SC of patients with ALS and healthy controls. By using a combination of approaches to simultaneously map the spatial transcriptome and proteome of all interacting cellular subpopulations in these regions, our aim is to elucidate the origins and temporal dynamics of inter- and intra-cellular activities that may reveal novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for ALS. Our overarching hypothesis is that ALS pathology stems from dysfunctional MN-glial interactions, and that this predictably differs in the M1 and SC in accordance with patient symptomatology. To address this hypothesis, we propose to use spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic measurements to study intact human postmortem tissue from patients stratified by clinical presentation (i.e., site of initial symptom presentation, bulbar or lower limb). We have previously implemented Spatial Transcriptomics on mouse and human SC to identify regional differences within subpopulations of various cell types that vary as a function of disease dynamics. Here, we propose to build upon our existing human study, and for the first time, develop a spatially resolved multi-omics dataset at scale and in the context of disease in matched human postmortem M1 and SC samples (Aim 1), to enable simultaneous exploration of upper and lower motor neurons in the context of intact tissue. These data will be directly tied to measures of ALS pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). To integrate and analyze relationships between data across modalities, we will develop a computational framework for harmonized analysis of multi-modal, multi- omic measures of ALS disease burden (Aim 2). Finally, we will implement highly multiplexed immuno-imaging to validate top gene candidates generated in Aim 1 at a single-cell level in situ (Aim 3). We expect to obtain an unmatched view of cellular interactions in the postmortem ALS M1 and SC, and to be able to directly link such interactions to features of ALS pathology in situ. This will allow us to identify dysregulated signaling that drives upper and lower motor neuron loss and associated symptoms in patients in ALS. Project Narrative Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease for which there are no biomarkers and only limited treatments stemming from a poor understanding of its pathogenesis. Here, we propose to integrate novel computational methods with spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of clinically deep-phenotyped postmortem ALS brains and spinal cords to determine the specific molecular correlates of functional impairment in this disease. By integrating these data with WGS and RNAseq data, our ultimate goal is to unveil how disease-associated variants drive specific dysfunction in ALS, which may in turn foster precision medicine-based treatment strategies.",Spatially Resolved Dynamics of Molecular Pathology and Intercellular Interactions in Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis,9946842,R01NS116350,"['ALS patients', 'Address', 'Age', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Indirect Immunofluorescence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neurons', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Lateral Sclerosis', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spinal Cord', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'functional disability', 'graph theory', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuron loss', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'precision medicine', 'protein TDP-43', 'regional difference', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem', 'symptomatology', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R01,2020,606794,0.05352195635021355
"Non-Invasive Single-Cell Morphometry and Tracking in Living Bacterial Biofilms Project Summary/Abstract  Biofilms are cohesive, multicellular microbial communities that are able to adhere to biotic or abiotic surfaces. The human microbiome contains numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species that help maintain normal human physiology. On the other hand, more than half of the 1.7 million hospital-acquired infections in the US are caused by biofilm-forming bacterial pathogens. The biofilm lifestyle is advantageous, because phenotypic diversity and coordination of cellular behaviors within biofilms provide bacterial populations with emergent capabilities beyond those of individual cells. For example, biofilms are orders of magnitude more tolerant towards physical, chemical, and biological stressors, most notably long-term treatments with antibiotic drugs or clearance attempts by the immune system. However, it remains largely unknown how such remarkable capabilities emerge from the behaviors of individual cells and the interactions between them. A critical barrier to rapid progress is the inability of conventional microscopes to resolve micrometer-sized bacterial cells in thick (>10 micrometers) biofilms in a non-invasive manner. The proposed research addresses this challenge by developing integrated experimental and computational technologies that enable non-invasive, 3D fluorescence imaging of pathogenic biofilms by lattice-light sheet microscopy, accurate single-cell segmentation and 3D shape measurements based on the acquired images, and simultaneous 3D tracking of thousands of cells inside biofilms. The ability to make single- cell measurements in dense microbial populations will enable researchers to correlate the spatial trajectory of each cell with that cells’ gene expression and behavioral phenotype. Such information will provide an integrated understanding of how bacteria coordinate gene expression and social behaviors in 3D space and time. A fundamental understanding of biofilm biology will help inform new strategies for harnessing the emergent functional capabilities of microbial populations and for removing pathogenic biofilms from undesired environments. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance  Bacterial biofilms are responsible for a large number of hospital-acquired infections, and currently used antibiotic and disinfection treatments are unable to cope with this epidemic. An integrated understanding of how individual bacterial cells act and interact with each other inside biofilms is necessary to inform new strategies for controlling biofilm growth. This project enables high-resolution, single-cell measurements inside living biofilms by developing new technologies for non-invasive biofilm imaging and computational tracking of thousands of bacterial cells in crowded environments.",Non-Invasive Single-Cell Morphometry and Tracking in Living Bacterial Biofilms,10034367,R01GM139002,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Disinfection', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Myxococcus xanthus', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Optics', 'Pathogenicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Shigella flexneri', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Water', 'antibiotic tolerance', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cell behavior', 'cell dimension', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'cohesion', 'environmental stressor', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'human pathogen', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'lens', 'live cell imaging', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'model design', 'morphometry', 'new technology', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'seal', 'social', 'stressor', 'supervised learning', 'temporal measurement']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,302927,0.0722196546595228
"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease. Computational methods that can identify regulatory networks and their dynamics across related mammalian cell types offer a powerful approach to create better models of human disease and for regenerative medicine.",Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages,9979901,R01GM117339,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Distal', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Maintenance', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signaling Protein', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Validation', 'cell fate specification', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human model', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multi-task learning', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'promoter', 'reconstruction', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,303220,0.0557937586473777
"Functional causality in regulating cell morphogenesis Morphogenesis is a fundamental process in a wide range of cell functions and therefore one of the best studied. Consequently, most of the contributing component processes and the majority of their molecular parts are known. Much less understood is how the many underlying component processes are integrated into a working whole. This integration is regulated by a system of chemical and mechanical pathways with i) a high level of non-linearity; ii) a high level of redundancy; and iii) a separation in space and time of cause and effect between component processes. A key consequence of such a pathway configuration is that perturbation of any component can lead to wide-ranging and fast adaptation. Hence, phenotypic changes primarily reflect a reconfiguration of the system and not necessarily the function of the perturbed target. This challenge has plagued the interrogation of molecular functions in cell morphogenesis, and has led to numerous controversies that likely relate to slight differences in experimental designs triggering divergent adaptation processes. To circumvent some of these limitations, my lab has developed over the past 10 years quantitative live cell imaging methods that reveal the functional interplay between spatially and temporally distributed molecular processes, such as cytoskeleton polymer dynamics, forces, and chemical signals, based on the coupling of their spontaneous activation fluctuations in unperturbed systems. Building on key discoveries of cell morphogenic control mechanisms, which required the use of a perturbation-free approach rather than a more conventional experimental paradigm, we propose here an extension of this research program that will introduce a rigorous statistical framework to infer the coupling of molecular processes in cause and effect cascades. This includes algorithms to identify directly, from fluctuation time series, feedback interactions between processes and the dynamic rewiring of the cause and effect cascades under variable cellular conditions. These computational developments will be paralleled by innovation in experimental systems for multispectral live cell imaging of up to 8 concurrent processes and for the analysis of cell morphogenesis in native tissue environments in 3D. The studies will be focused on the coordination of the system of highly redundant actin modulating factors in promoting actin mediated cell shape changes and the interactions of this system with the regulatory system of RhoGTPase signals. The impact of this work will reach far beyond the new insights we will gain of the regulation of these pathway systems. The work will address the notorious adaptation responses of complex molecular systems, which are generic and a fundamental impediment to the systematic inquiry of cell functions. The tools we develop to overcome some of these problems will be made available as widely-adoptable approaches to the analysis of cell regulatory processes. The ability of cells to control their shape and architecture in response to changing cell-external and -internal conditions is the basis of almost every aspect in normal physiology. Deficiencies in this control are the cause of innumerable pathologies and diseases. In this research program, the PI and his laboratory will continue to develop innovative research methods integrating molecular cell biology, live cell microscopy, computer vision, and statistical and mathematical modeling to probe the complex interplay of spatially and temporally distributed chemical signals and mechanical forces that underlie the morphogenic processes.",Functional causality in regulating cell morphogenesis,9931959,R35GM136428,"['3-Dimensional', 'Actins', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'live cell imaging', 'live cell microscopy', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical force', 'programs', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R35,2020,377554,0.07507305110858735
"Turning a sequence barcode into a spectral barcode for single-cell analysis. Project Summary: The use of sequence barcodes has enabled high-throughput transcriptomic analysis of single cells. But one challenge remains – there is no method to map the physical assessments of single cells and the downstream transcriptomic data of single cells to the same cells of origin. This is because currently sequence barcodes are only read by sequencing which takes place after all single cells are lysed, reverse transcription is completed, and cDNA are amplified and pooled. In order to perform transcriptomic analysis and physical assessments on the same single cells, we will need a method that allows us to decipher the sequence barcodes while in the process of single-cell physical interrogation. Our goal in this proposed research is to develop a new method to turn sequence barcodes into spectral barcodes that can be read locally in the process. The proposed sequence- barcode-reading technique, if it can be realized, will have substantial impact to the single-cell community as it will become the only method to map the physical assessments and the downstream molecular analysis data to the same cells of origin in a high-throughput, streamlined format. Project Narrative: High-throughput single-cell analysis has advanced our knowledge in developmental biology and disease origins. But currently there is no method to map the physical and transcriptional analysis data of single cells to the same cells of origin.

"Investigating how mechanical connectivity yields developmental robustness ABSTRACT  It is essential for the fate of an organism that key morphogenetic processes occur reproducibly even under tissue damage or environmental perturbations. While much is known about how genetic redundancy and regulation achieves robust development, less is understood about how a tissue mechanically ensures reproducible shape change when perturbed. This project uncovers how populations of physically interacting cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their collective behavior to still sculpt the correct final shape.  One way for cells to coordinate tissue-scale forces and movements is through direct mechanical connections. In fact, many developing tissues exhibit supracellular networks of actomyosin connections that link hundreds of cells. A large roadblock has been with the challenges of imaging and quantifying subcellular protein at the tissue scale. I adapted a topological smoothing algorithm originally used to trace high-noise filamentous structure of galaxies in the Universe to data to trace high-noise filamentous myosin structure in confocal images. This allowed for the first quantification of a supracellular myosin network across an entire tissue over developmental time. Subsequent analysis adopting techniques from network theory allowed me to identify that the robust folding of the Drosophila fruit fly embryo during ventral furrow formation is mechanically ensured by patterns in the supracellular network spanning its ventral cells.  This newly discovered importance of supracellular networks in coordinating robust shape change highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of how supracellular networks form, and how their patterns impact the function and robustness of a population of cells. Deciphering robustness at the tissue-level, where the displacement and fate of hundreds of cells must be considered, requires techniques at the interface of cell and developmental biology, biophysics and computer science. The proposed project will take a highly interdisciplinary approach to identify how supracellular network patterns are controlled molecularly, at the cell level, and via tissue constraints. As well, how heterogeneity in tissue-level patterns impacts morphogenetic robustness will be addressed. Together this comprehensive study of the structure and function of supracellular networks will represent a new way to interpret mechanical robustness across diverse developing tissues. As well, a generalized description of mechanical robustness has the potential to uncover new paths to predict and control tissue malformation, which would represent a significant advance for both developmental biology and fetal medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE The robust establishment of correct shape is essential for proper tissue function. Tissue shape change is a mechanical process that necessitates the coordinated force generation and motion of thousands of cells. Identifying how physically interacting cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their behavior to still sculpt the correct final shape will shed light onto many congenital disorders that result from morphogenetic dysregulation.",Investigating how mechanical connectivity yields developmental robustness,9950519,K99GM136915,"['Actomyosin', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biophysics', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Size', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Disorders', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Galaxy', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Mechanics', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transportation', 'Work', 'cohesion', 'computer science', 'confocal imaging', 'congenital heart disorder', 'fetal', 'fetal medicine', 'fly', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'malformation', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'theories', 'tissue-level behavior', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2020,98836,0.046357153858219625
"Multiscale Resolution and Deep Network Approaches for Deconvolving Different Cell Types in Bulk Tumor using Single-cell Sequencing Data (scDEC) Abstract: Tumors are complex ecosystems composed of heterogeneous cell populations. Understanding the clonal cellular composition of the tumor and the non-malignant cells within the tumor ecosystem provides significant insights in the tumor recurrence, treatment, initiation, progression and metastasis. Previous studies estimated immune cell type content in bulk tumor expression data using immune cell signatures generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, with the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing methods, we can now also estimate the tumor associated non-malignant and malignant cell type contents.  In this proposal, we describe a novel deep net approach for deconvolving different cell types in bulk tumor using single-cell sequencing data (scDEC). We will also infer tumor associated copy number variation (CNV) clones and their signatures from single-cell RNA sequencing data using our novel multiscale resolution signal processing based algorithm. Our approach will estimate not only the content of different immune cell types and tumor associated non-malignant cell types but also the content of different CNV clone types in bulk tumor. Moreover, we will discover new associations between cell type content and sample phenotype such as disease survival, subtype and outcome. Our proposed project will lead to major improvements in clinical care to guide the treatment and prognosis of various types of cancer. Narrative Here we describe a novel multiscale resolution and deep net based approaches for deconvolving different cell types in bulk tumor using single cell RNA sequencing data (scDEC). Using our scDEC algorithm, we will identify novel associations between different cell type contents including immune cell, non-malignant tumor associated cell and CNV clone type contents and sample phenotypes such as disease survival.

"CGMP Compliant Closed Cell Culture System for Reproducible De-differentiation of human somatic cells into iPSCs CGMP Compliant Closed Cell Culture System for Reproducible De-differentiation of human somatic cells into iPSCs Abstract The advancement of iPSC-based personalized cell therapies is currently hindered by the challenges in the biomanufacturing of therapeutic cells. Despite approaches that have made the derivation, growth and differentiation of iPSCs more efficient, there remains significant variability in reprogramming efficacy, genomic integrity and developmental potential of iPSCs derived from patient tissue samples. These variabilities include lot-dependent or technician-dependent differentiation efficiency, bacterial or fungal contamination risks, CO2 or O2 concentration level stresses during cell maintenance, high costs or cross- contamination risks with centralized biomanufacturing facility and requirement of cGMP criteria or regulatory compliance. The difference of iPSCs derived from the same sample in their in-vitro growth characteristics and their inability to re-differentiate into the desired tissue type will cause serious problems in therapy. The further advance of iPSC-based personalized medicine is currently limited by the difficulty to generate iPSCs for large populations and at an affordable cost. Therefore Biopico Systems Inc will solve such challenges by developing an automated cGMP Compliant Closed Cell Culture System for reproducible de-differentiation of human somatic cells into iPSCs. To commercialize Biopico's “CellsMX” system, optimization of closed media exchange system and integration of customized mRNA/ media formulation front-end for reprogramming will be performed in this Phase II research. The CellsMX system will provide quality assurance to the customers for mass production under cGMP guidelines, as operating license are issued to biological entities along with how cells are produced, tested, and released for therapeutic use. Further, even, if a large number of patients need iPSC-based personalized cell therapies, under CellsMX closed system, patient cells are not cross-contaminated and the system can be deployed at the point of care avoiding high costs and risks associated with the transportation, logistics, tracking, and recording. While patient-specific iPSC strategy's reduction of immunologic stimulus will drive the initial market segment for the CellsMX system, Biopico will develop a suite of products for several of such therapeutic culture processes. Narrative The stem cells can address diseases such as cancer or damaged or dysfunctional organs using tissues or cell therapies. The enormous transplant waiting lists results in many people die awaiting transplants. Further, to provide stem cells as a viable source of replacement cells to treat diseases, the manufacturing costs are presently not affordable keeping public expectations unrealistic. Biopico's CellsMX reprogramming platform can address these issues to generate large number of iPSC and supply cells for stem cell banking or stem cell therapy applications.",CGMP Compliant Closed Cell Culture System for Reproducible De-differentiation of human somatic cells into iPSCs,10082372,R44GM139413,"['Address', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biomanufacturing', 'Biotechnology', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Cell Culture System', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Custom', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Differentiation and Growth', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fibroblasts', 'Film', 'Formulation', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunologics', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Legal patent', 'Licensing', 'Liquid substance', 'Logistics', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microscope', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Cell', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Syringes', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Therapy', 'Tissues', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation', 'Transportation', 'Vial device', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'flasks', 'genome integrity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'meter', 'novel', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'quality assurance', 'stem cell therapy', 'stem cells', 'stressor', 'success', 'wasting']",NIGMS,BIOPICO,R44,2020,400000,0.10848167594125353
"Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution Abstract The nematode C. elegans is unique among model organisms in having a defined lineage and known connections for all its 302 neurons. The genome sequence was completed more than 20 years ago, but knowing which genes in the genome are used in exactly which cells and what transcription factors are controlling that expression remains a major challenge. We have successfully applied single cell- (sc-)RNA-seq methods to one larval stage and three embryonic stages to measure the RNA content of individual cells across the whole animal. We also have preliminary data that indicates that we can assay chromatin accessibility at the single cell level using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). We now propose to collect both sc-RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data at multiple stages to determine the gene expression patterns of each cell in the worm and the active regulatory sequence throughout the entire life cycle of C. elegans. In turn we will use the combined data sets along with chromatin- immunoprecipitation- (ChIP-) seq data to impute what transcription factors are controlling expression of each gene in the genome in every cell and what regulatory sequences these transcription factors recognize. The results will provide a valuable resource to scientists studying the worm and addresses a major outstanding question in the molecular biology of development. In addition, these data sets, from an animal with a “ground truth” should serve as a platform for methods development in the single cell field. Narrative The nematode C. elegans is a simple animal that as an adult has just 959 somatic cells that arise from a known and constant lineage. We propose to use single cell methods to measure in every cell the expression of each gene and the active regulatory regions throughout the life cycle.

"Single cell activation dynamics as a predictor and regulator of aged MuSC dysfunction. Project Summary During tissue repair, many stem cell populations undergo a dynamic phenotypic change from a quiescent state to an activated state. In muscle stem cells (MuSCs), this dynamic activation process is essential for effective tissue regeneration. Despite the conserved nature of these activation processes, the dynamics of stem cell activation and their contribution to disease states remains largely unknown. We have generated single cell assays that allowed us to study state transitions of adult and aged MuSCs during activation. These results support a conceptual view of the aged stem cell phenotype as a combination of pathological steady-states and deficiencies in cell state dynamics. This provides us with the opportunity to identify factors that rejuvenate MuSC function during aging. In this project we will examine the role of physiological rejuvenation interventions on MuSC heterogeneity and activation state transitions. Understanding how rejuvenation interventions control MuSC activation response is critical for the effective treatment of the ever-expanding aged population. Project Narrative Satellite cells or Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are heterogeneous at the molecular and function level. Aging leads to a loss of MuSC function through a delay in activation at the level of molecular and behavioral kinetics.

"Critical role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells The goal of this proposal is to study the role of transcription factor TCF-1 in determining the epigenetic identity of memory CD8+ T cells. Our adaptive immune system has evolved a unique capacity to remember a pathogen through the generation of memory T cells, which protect the host in the event of reinfection. A better understanding of memory T cell differentiation is crucial for developing strategies to limit T cell responses in organ transplantation or enhance T cell responses during chronic infections. Although it is known that the transcription factor TCF-1 is required for memory CD8+ T cell function, the mechanisms through which this protein controls memory T cell fate remain unclear. Recently, we discovered that a mechanism through which TCF-1 controls the development of T cells relates to its unprecedented ability to create the chromatin accessibility landscape of naïve T cells. We found that TCF-1 is selectively enriched at genomic regions that become accessible at the earliest stages of development and is required for the accessibility of these regulatory elements. At the single-cell level, TCF-1 can dictate a coordinate opening of chromatin in T cells. Moreover, ectopic TCF-1 can directly erase repressive chromatin marks in non-T cells, generating de novo open chromatin and inducing the expression of T cell genes. While our recent data determined the novel role of TCF-1 on the epigenome during T cell development, our findings also raised another critical question: what is the role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells? We hypothesize that TCF-1 in cooperation with transcription factor partners defines the epigenetic landscape of memory T cells. Our new preliminary data further indicate that TCF-1 expression post T cell activation in vitro can lead to gains in chromatin accessibility at pro-memory genes. However, it remains unclear if TCF-1 expression in T cells responding to an infection can create the epigenetic identity of memory T cells. The domains of TCF-1 required for targeting the chromatin and its potential cooperating factors also remain unknown. How TCF-1 dependent changes on the epigenome relate to pro-memory genes needs to be defined. To answer these questions, we will interrogate the effect of TCF-1 and its potential partners on the chromatin state and accessibility of CD8+ T cells in vitro. Using the state-of-the-art tools, we will generate the map of TCF-1 dependent 3D genome organization and define how changes on the epigenome relate to memory genes. We will further translate these findings in vivo exploiting single-cell epigenomic, transcriptomic, and flow cytometry assays. The expected outcome of this proposal is a detailed understanding of the fundamental interaction between TCF-1 and the chromatin in peripheral T cells which can be exploited to devise combination therapies including epigenetic editing to selectively alter T cell fate at will.

"Single Cell Transcriptomic and Genetic Diversity by Single Molecule Long Read Sequencing PROJECT SUMMARY Defining the features of cellular mixtures, where diverse cell types with distinct genomic characteristics are physically intermingled together, is a central problem in biology. During the past decade, single cell sequencing technologies have enabled a new era of high throughput and high resolution interrogation of cell type diversity, vastly expanding our understanding of the role that cell types play in development and disease. Yet, current studies in single cell genomics rely on short-read sequencing and thus suffer from limitations, including: (1) Most studies rely on short read counting which limits the study of alternative splicing. (2) Cell states are reflected by static snapshots, and while population dynamics can be deduced through trajectory and RNA velocity estimation, robust estimation of these parameters remains a major challenge. (3) Despite advances in single-cell DNA sequencing, there is yet no cost-effective way to simultaneously characterize both the genetic variants and transcriptome-level changes in a cell, which is crucial for diseases such as cancer. This proposal is motivated by technological breakthroughs in single-molecule sequencing (SMS) and the recent adaptation of SMS to the massively parallel sequencing of single cell transcriptomes in our lab. We propose to develop computational methods to harness the power of SMS in single cell transcriptomics. In particular, we have developed a new genomic approach which allows one to repeatedly interrogate complete transcripts from single cells using SMS long reads, rather than 3' or 5' counting with short reads. This technology allows experimental designs where specific transcript subsets and/or cellular subsets can be repeatedly targeted for deeper joint short and long read analysis over many iterations, which we will exploit to conduct analyses that were previously intractable.

"Systems-level identification of key regulators deciding immune cell state Abstract Understanding the mechanisms and identifying regulators of immune cell development and differentiation are critical for developing new and more effective therapeutics. The fast advancement of genomic technologies provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the immune cells at the system level. The noise in the high throughput measurements and the complexity of multiple omics data make it an urgent need for developing novel and powerful systems biology approach for integrative analysis to reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms for immune system. We propose a new method to integrate multiomics data at the genetic network level for identification of key regulators deciding the cell state and cell fate (Specific Aim 1). We will apply the method to systematically uncover the regulatory mechanisms in the mouse immune system by analyzing 86 immune cell populations (Specific Aim 2). We will also perform comparative analysis of the human and mouse immune cells to reveal the conserved regulatory code for immune cell specification (Specific Aim 3). We will rigorously assess the performance of the computational analysis, experimentally confirm the importance of the identified key regulators and investigate their roles in regulating immune cell functions. Once complete, the proposed work will provide not only a general tool for integrative analysis of multiomics data but also specific mechanistic insights for understanding the regulation of immune system functions.

"A ""Culture"" Shift: Integrated Bacterial Screening and Antibacterial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Bloodstream Infections PROJECT SUMMARY The ability for clinicians to effectively treat bacterial infections with targeted antibacterials in the acute-care settings hinges on diagnostics capable of identifying the pathogen broadly and determining its susceptibility to antibacterials in a timely manner. Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a particularly representative disease because it is the leading cause of death due to infections with rapid disease progression. Unfortunately, the inconvenient delay of blood culture for definitive diagnosis contributes to widespread empiric use of broad- spectrum antibacterials and emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Toward addressing this critical unmet need, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform that integrates bacterial detection, species identification (ID), and antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) from blood samples in a streamlined test. The expected sample-to-answer turnaround time is 90 min for ID and as early as 2-3 hr for AST. Such integrated diagnostic solution within the proposed timeframe will transform acute-care clinicians’ ability to establish diagnosis of bacterial infections, need for infection control, and antibacterial treatment based on objective data to improve clinical outcome. Using an innovative microfluidic digital array chip for assaying single cells as a backbone technology, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform which promises rapid ID and AST and allows customizable workflow and assay tailored to the clinical scenario while adjustable based on real-time results. The array chip seamlessly integrates digitization of cells, brief incubation (under various drug conditions), single-cell PCR (scPCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (scRT-PCR) and single-cell high-resolution melt (scHRM). Thereby, bacterial pathogen can be detected at the level of single-cells, identified based on species- specific melt curves, and their antibacterial susceptibility profile subsequently assessed by measuring changes in rRNA level as a biosynthetic marker of cell viability. ScPCR/scRT-PCR enables sensitive detection and absolute quantification of rRNA of individual cells critical to rapid and reliable differentiation between viable and no-viable cells; while scHRM overcomes a key limitation of bulk HRM to resolve multiple species for diagnosing polymicrobial infections or discarding contaminations. Since both ID and AST do not rely on culture, they reduce total turnaround time from days to minutes/hours.

"SPOTs: Optical Technologies for Instantly Quantifying Multicellular Response Profiles PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human organ systems require temporally and spatially coordinated multicellular actions at a macroscale to actuate, sustain, or terminate dedicated and vital functions. Cells that comprise discrete or distributed physiologic systems that fail to respond to appropriate stimuli with coordination may cause significant morbidity and often mortality. Collective and coordinated physiologic activities typically involve millions to billions of cells that may span large physical distances. Technologies for quantifying the electrical, chemical, and mechanical coupling in these multicellular systems are critically important to understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease and develop therapeutic approaches. However, no technology currently exists to quantify rapid mechanical cell responses to transmitted distal perturbations for all cells within a collection of cells. This multi- PI proposal (Chiou (contact PI) and Teitell) aims to develop a new platform imaging technology called SPOT (single pixel optical technology) for concurrent and direct measurements of cellular traction forces over a 1.0 x 1.0 cm2 field of view (FOV) with cellular spatial resolution, and a 1,000 frames/sec temporal resolution. SPOT provides a 4-order of magnitude larger FOV than conventional traction force microscopy. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) are the test bed here because of a high potential for impact in cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality in the Western World. We will demonstrate the ability for SPOT to determine quantitative indices of abnormalities for human CM contraction and relaxation in healthy and diseased states. We will establish proof of concept studies in SPOT screens for small molecules that augment or affect CM contraction in desmoplakin deficient states. We will build a platform that integrates SPOT for direct contraction force measurements and Optical Mapping for electrical property measurements for sheets of CMs. This will enable, for the first time, studies of temporal and spatial electromechanical coupling behaviors for sheets of CMs at single cell resolution. We will distinguish different subtypes of CMs, their distributions, their interactions, and their phenotypic responses under external perturbations. And we will apply this platform to investigate the structural and electromechanical coupling properties of hESC-derived CMs by integrating quantitative biomass and stiffness data measured using non-invasive live cell interferometry (LCI). Changes in biomass and cell stiffness are druggable biophysical parameters with correlates to mechanical contraction/relaxation cycles of CMs. In addition to detailed studies of CMs that have the potential to impact the number one killer of US citizens, SPOT applications should have utility and provide new insights in additional settings that require cell or tissue traction-force generation. Such settings could include models in a dish for wound healing, cancer cell metastasis, or models of diseases that affect cell and tissue structural integrity, such as connective tissue disorders Ehlers-Danlos or Marfan syndromes. PROJECT NARATIVE Our proposal is exclusively technology development but portends public health relevance because we will invent a way to quantify previously undiscoverable interactions and mechanical responses to external and internal perturbations in interconnected biological systems, as occurs in physiologic and pathologic states. We will develop, test and fine-tune a new technology platform called SPOT (Single Pixel Optical Technology) to extract mechanical responses at cellular resolution in a very wide field, in real-time, concurrently for all cells in a sheet to enable studies and potentially new-age therapeutics that are currently impossible.",SPOTs: Optical Technologies for Instantly Quantifying Multicellular Response Profiles,9972477,R01GM127985,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Biomass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Distal', 'Drug Screening', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fibroblasts', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Giant Cells', 'Goals', 'Heart Atrium', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Interferometry', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmacology Study', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Spottings', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Traction Force Microscopy', 'Transplantation', 'Ventricular', 'Western World', 'biological systems', 'biophysical properties', 'body system', 'cancer cell', 'design', 'desmoplakin', 'electrical measurement', 'electrical property', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mechanical properties', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'patch clamp', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'regenerative', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,530374,0.08209531272397719
"Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data Project Summary Understanding how genes' activities are controlled is crucial for elucidating the basic operating rules of biology and molecular mechanisms of diseases. Recent innovations in single-cell genomic technologies have opened the door to analyzing a variety of functional genomic features in individual cells. These technologies enable scientists to systematically discover unknown cell subpopulations in complex tissue and disease samples, and allow them to reconstruct a sample's gene regulatory landscape at an unprecedented cellular resolution. Despite these promising developments, many challenges still exist and must be overcome before one can fully decode gene regulation at the single-cell resolution. In particular, current technologies lack the ability to accurately measure the activity of each individual cis-regulatory element (CRE) in a single cell. They also cannot measure all functional genomic data types in the same cell. Moreover, the prevalent technical biases and noises in single-cell genomic data make computational analysis non-trivial. With rapid growth of data, lack of computational tools for data analysis has become a rate-limiting factor for effective applications of single-cell genomic technologies.  The objective of this proposal is to develop computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory landscape using single-cell genomic data. Our Aim 1 addresses the challenge of accurately measuring CRE activities in single cells using single-cell regulome data. Regulome, deﬁned as the activities of all cis-regulatory elements in a genome, contains crucial information for understanding gene regulation. The state-of-the-art technologies for mapping regulome in a single cell produce sparse data that cannot accurately measure activities of individual CREs. We will develop a new computational framework to allow more accurate analysis of individual CREs' activities in single cells using sparse data. Our Aim 2 addresses the challenge of collecting multiple functional genomic data types in the same cell. We will develop a method that uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the most widely used single-cell functional genomic technology, to predict cells' regulatory landscape. Since most scRNA-seq datasets do not have accompanying single-cell data for other -omics data types, our method will also signiﬁcantly expand the utility and increase the value of scRNA- seq experiments. Our Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating different data types generated by different single-cell genomic technologies from different cells. We will develop a method to align single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell regulome data to generate an integrated map of transcriptome and regulome.  Upon completion of this proposal, we will deliver our methods through open-source software tools. These tools will be widely useful for analyzing and integrating single-cell regulome and transcriptome data. By addressing several major challenges in single-cell genomics, our new methods and tools will help unleash the full potential of single-cell genomic technologies for studying gene regulation. As such, they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases. Project Narrative Understanding how genes' activities are controlled at single-cell resolution is crucial for studying human diseases. This proposal will develop a coordinated set of computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory programs using single-cell genomic data. These methods and tools will allow scientists to more accurately and comprehensively reconstruct gene regulatory landscape of individual cells in complex tissue and disease samples, and they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases.",Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data,10001077,R01HG010889,"['Address', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stem Cell Development', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transposase', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'multiple data types', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,409375,0.09610026093705507
"Function and circuitry of adaptive inhibition in the retina Studies of the visual system face a number of challenges, two of which are the intricacy of the cell types and synaptic connections that comprise the nervous system, and the complexity of the computational processes that underlie vision. Although the retina is one of the most characterized and well understood neural circuits of the visual system, it nonetheless has a great diversity of cell types, connections and computations. The normal function of the retina is to convey information about natural visual scenes, which have complex spatial and temporal structure. The processing of natural scenes has the greatest relevance towards a fundamental understanding retinal function, and the greatest clinical relevance. Yet most studies of retinal visual processing and circuitry focus on responses to simple artificial stimuli rarely encountered normally, such as flashing spots, drifting stripes and flickering checkerboards. With respect to retinal cell types greatest diversity lies in a class of inhibitory interneurons known as amacrine cells. These cells make extensive lateral and feedback connections, and although they form stereotyped connections between each other, excitatory bipolar cells, and ganglion cells that transit signals in the optic nerve, the functional effects of nearly all of these cell types are poorly understood. This proposal aims towards a direct characterization of the functional effects of amacrine cells under ethologically relevant stimuli, including natural scenes. We combine approaches of perturbation and recording using electrical and optical methods as well as computational modeling to characterize the specific contributions of amacrine cells to stimuli that include the representation of moving objects. We take advantage of recently developed computational approaches that can simultaneously capture the retinal response to a broad range of stimuli including natural scenes, capture a wide range of phenomena previously characterized only with artificial stimuli, and that have internal units highly correlated with retinal interneurons. Our goals are to 1) Create a quantitative understanding of the functional contributions of a class of sustained amacrine cells in the salamander retina for specific stimuli including those that represent moving objects and natural scenes, and test hypotheses related to dynamic effects on visual sensitivity and sensory features generated by those amacrine cells 2) Use molecularly defined amacrine cells in the mouse to quantitatively characterize the functional contribution of specific amacrine cell types to specific stimuli including artificial moving objects and natural scenes. These studies create a new way to generate and test hypotheses related to the quantitative effect of any interneuron on retinal output under any visual stimulus. Understanding how retinal circuitry creates visual processing under natural scenes is critical to our understanding of retinal mechanisms and diseases involving the degeneration of the retinal circuitry. In addition, the computational descriptions of retinal responses will be directly useful in the design of electronic retinal prosthesis systems. The retina is a complex network of many cell types, including the most diverse but poorlyunderstood class of cells, amacrine cells. By understanding how inhibitory neurons change neural processing in the retina under natural visual scenes, we can begin to address how these cells and their connections degenerate during retinal diseases, an essential step in designing treatments for these diseases. Furthermore, by creating accurate computational models of the retinal response to natural scenes, this research will be immediately applicable to electronic retinal prosthesis systems that aim to restore vision in cases of photoreceptor degeneration.",Function and circuitry of adaptive inhibition in the retina,9892016,R01EY022933,"['Address', 'Amacrine Cells', 'Archives', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Injections', 'Interneurons', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Methods', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Salamander', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spottings', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'ganglion cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'novel strategies', 'photoreceptor degeneration', 'predicting response', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'retinal prosthesis', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,392194,0.015013198931340163
"Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis Abstract While rapid advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing are yielding comprehensive taxonomies of cell states in the human body, understanding the complex molecular and environmental factors that regulate cell behavior remains a central challenge. New methods for simultaneous measurement of multiple molecular modalities, spatial context, and lineage relationships are needed to address this goal, but are currently outside the scope of present technologies which largely focus on a single data type. We propose to create a Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis, with a mission to develop a comprehensive suite of technologies and analytical methods to measure and integrate the molecular and environmental determinants of cellular identity. To achieve these goals, we propose the following series of synergistic Aims that will be developed in parallel: 1) Develop massively- parallel assays to simultaneously profile multiple molecular components across millions of cells; 2) Identify the spatial and environmental determinants of cellular state in complex interacting populations; 3) Develop scalable platforms to profile inherited molecular components, and determine the role of cell lineage in establishing molecular and phenotypic differences across cells; and 4) Develop methods to harmonize single- cell profiles across distinct modalities, enabling the inference of cellular identity. Our Center will address critical challenges in data integration, and produce software and protocols that will be applicable to diverse biological systems. We will share these resources broadly with the community, alongside a broader educational focus to encourage New York City students from under-represented backgrounds to pursue academic training in Genomics and Systems Biology. Project Narrative Understanding how the molecular components, inherited lineage, and spatial milieu of single cells dictate function in health and disease remains a key outstanding challenge in genomics. The overarching goal of our Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis is to develop methods to simultaneously assess these multimodal cellular properties, develop tools to harmonize them to allow inferential assessment of cell identity based on partial phenotyping, and share these developments with the broad scientific community while encouraging community engagement through education and outreach.

"In situ transcriptome profiling in single cells Summary We have recently developed intron seqFISH (sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization) to multiplex 10,421 genes directly in single cells. We showed that the 10,421 gene nascent transcriptome profile can identify cell types as well as capture the trajectory of the cells. We further demonstrated that we can perform mRNA seqFISH as well as immunostaining in the same cells following the 10,421 gene intron seqFISH measurement. We propose to develop this technology as a potential alternative approach to single cell RNAseq for the HuBMAP to characterize cell types directly in situ in tissues. In particular, we will adept in situ amplification methods such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to intron seqFISH. We had previously shown that mRNA seqFISH with HCR amplification performs exceptionally in tissues in overcoming autofluorescence background and enable robust decoding seqFISH barcodes. We will validate the integrated intron and mRNA seqFISH protocol in the mouse hippocampus in the UG3 phase of the project. Also in UG3 phase, we will develop computational tools to integrate intron seqFISH data with mRNA seqFISH as well as single cell RNAseq data. In the UH3 phase, we will translate the technology to human tissues, with a focus on human mammary tissues provided by Dr. Seewaldt at City of Hope. We will also work with the tissue mapping centers in the HuBMAP program to accelerate the translation of this technology to many tissue types. In the UH3 phase, we will generate million cell spatial atlas of human tissues containing intron profiles, mRNA profiles and protein abundances in each single cell. We will further develop computational tools to analyze for spatial enrichment of genes in the tissue and generate a pseudotime of developmental trajectories using the nascent transcriptome data. Taken together, we will develop a high throughput in situ imaging based platform to characterize cell types and future trajectories of cells using intron and mRNA seqFISH technologies. Narrative Transcriptome profiling in situ at the single cell level has transformative potential for understanding healthy versus diseased tissues in the human body. We propose an integrative approach profiling the nascent transcriptome as well as hundreds of mature transcripts in single cells in tissues. We will generate million cell spatial atlas for the mouse hippocampus as well as the human mammary tissue.

"UW 4-Dimensional Genomic Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center Project Summary / Abstract A major shortcoming of most efforts to understand the 4D nucleome is that they have mainly focused on in vitro cell lines, rather than on dynamic, in vivo systems. Arguably, the most important in vivo system, which also happens to be the most dynamic, is development itself, wherein the nucleome both shapes and is shaped by the initial emergence of the myriad mammalian cell types. While these in vivo dynamics are presently poorly documented and understood, recently emerged technologies offer a path forward. Here we propose to establish the University of Washington 4-Dimensional Genomic Nuclear Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME Center), which will address these massive gaps in our understanding by generating systematic datasets on nuclear morphology and associated molecular measurements in mammalian tissues and cell types. These datasets will be generated in the context of the leading model organism for mammalian development, the mouse. Our approach focuses on following nuclear structure, chromatin and gene expression changes at a “whole organism” scale, using a combination of scalable single cell profiling and “visual cell sorting” (VCS) methods, all well-established and mostly developed in our own labs. Our goal is to generate a high- resolution 4DN atlas of mouse embryogenesis for the community. The different types of data will be integrated, including cross-species imputation to integrate with human data, as well as models and navigable maps applied to pathways relevant to mammalian development. Project Narrative The UW 4D Genome Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME) aims to elucidate chromatin dynamics during the early stages of mammalian development. Accordingly, the proposed center will carry out systematic generation of sequencing and imaging data during mouse embryogenesis, summarizing and visualizing the resulting data using machine learning models. These approaches will also be applied to investigate nuclear architecture in mouse models with mutations in genes relevant to nuclear structure, which will help advance our understanding of diseases such as laminopathy and cancer.",UW 4-Dimensional Genomic Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center,10151918,UM1HG011586,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleolus', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Four-dimensional', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterochromatin', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lamin Type A', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'RNA', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stains', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Washington', 'Whole Organism', 'X Inactivation', 'base', 'cell type', 'human data', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'in vivo', 'knowledge translation', 'lamin B receptor', 'molecular phenotype', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'nucleophosmin', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web portal']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,UM1,2020,2031051,0.03186700282273559
"Continuous Probing of Nanoconstruct-Cell Interactions at Biologically Relevant Time Scales PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal aims to develop live-cell, multi-channel imaging tools that can visualize—continuously, and in real time—nanoparticle interactions with cellular components. We will focus on several different time windows, where early time periods will monitor nanoparticle-cell membrane binding and uptake and later times will track endosomal accumulation and escape. The ability to resolve temporally and spatially how particle size/shape and ligand density affects interactions in 3D is critical for determining structure-activity-relationships and mechanism of action in live cells. To characterize interactions of functional nanoparticles with different cellular structures at physiologically relevant times, we propose to design a multi-channel optical microscope integrated with an opto- splitter and custom live-cell imaging chamber. Simultaneous images can be acquired in different channels of the fluorescence of dye-labeled organelles and dye-labeled ligands on the particles as well as differential interference contrast (DIC) signals of whole cells, cellular components, and nanoparticle cores. Correlation of structural and functional images provides a powerful window into how local nanoconstruct interactions can mediate a biological response. For model systems, we will compare gold nanoconstructs with oligonucleotide ligand shells of both targeting (DNA aptamers) or non-targeting (siRNA) properties. Nanoparticle shape enables a unique handle to probe rotation and orientation of intracellular particle interactions. This work can bridge a gap in understanding the behavior of nanoconstructs intracellularly and how the integrity and presentation of oligonucleotides in ligand shells affects targeting and other processes such as endosomal escape, which is critical to assess therapeutic efficacy. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  This proposal aims to design tools that can visualize nanoparticle interactions with cells at distinct time points with biological relevance. Our ultimate goal is to evaluate how nanoconstructs interact with cellular membranes and sub-cellular components.

"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Human Retina PROJECT SUMMARY Vision, the most important of the human senses, occupies 25% of the brain function. It requires an orchestrated coordination between all parts of the eye. Of all the parts, the retina is the most vital for normal perception of an image. It is a precisely layered structure lining the surface of the back of the eye, comprising many millions of cells packed together in a tightly knit network. The optic nerve connects the retina with the brain. The retina not only receives light, but also processes it, and transmits downstream signals to the midbrain and the thalamus. When the retina becomes diseased, the unfortunate result is blindness, which is the most feared disability. Diseases that affect the retina are complex because of the diverse number of cell types and total number of cells involved. It remains challenging to assess if pathological phenotypes affect diverse cell populations versus highly specific cell types. While advances in retinal disease diagnostics have progressed rapidly, treatments for retinal diseases directed at primary genetic defects have progressed slowly. Despite major successes in genetics, the vision community is lagging behind the advances in precision medicine occurring in other specialties. Modest progress is due in part to an incomplete understanding of human retinal biology. Anatomical differences between humans and commonly used animal models have severely hindered the translation of results from laboratory to human health. Therefore, there is an urgent need to collect and analyze retinal cells from human eyes to advance our understanding of human retinal diseases and assess the cell type conservation between mouse and human. Recent technologic breakthroughs in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) have made it possible to measure gene expression in single cells, paving the way for exploring cellular heterogeneity. Collaborating with the Alabama Eye Bank, we will deeply sample human retinal cells, fully characterize cell diversity, and elucidate the functional roles of findings from genome- wide association studies for retinal diseases. We propose the following aims. Aim 1 will generate scRNA-seq data from eyes of 20 healthy adult human donors, and produce de-noised gene expression data for downstream analyses. Aim 2 will characterize cell diversity in human retina and supporting tissues, and validate novel cell type-specific marker genes by immunohistochemistry. Aim 3 will infer cell type compositions and allele-specific gene expression in each cell type by integrating scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data from normal human eyes. These pioneering studies leverage novel methods and interdisciplinary expertise to characterize cell type-specific gene expression in human retina and supporting tissues. By detailed characterization of the cell atlases in four geographical areas in human eye, our study will provide novel insights into cell-type specific functions that can power precision therapeutic targeting of retinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE The retina is the most vital for normal perception of an image in the eye. Diseases that affect the retina are complex, and it remains challenging to assess if pathological phenotypes originate in diverse cell populations or highly specific cell types.

"T4SS effectors and tick tropism in Anaplasma phagocytolium Project Summary  Tick-borne diseases are on the increase, and are responsible for nearly all of the vector-transmitted disease in the US. Vector-borne pathogens face the dual challenge of adaptation to two very different host environments: the arthropod vector and the mammalian host. To survive within eukaryotic cells, the rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum blocks phago-lysosome maturation, inhibits apoptosis, modulates host gene expression, redirects trans-Golgi trafficking, and repurposes autophagic machinery to build a replication vacuole. A. phagocytophilum must accomplish this, all while evading the unique innate immune defenses of mammalian and arthropod host cells. All pathogens in the order Rickettsiales utilize a specialized Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) to deliver effector molecules into the host cell cytosol to mediate host pathogen interactions. However, identification of the secreted effectors has been limited by the obligate nature of these pathogens. Even less is known about how effectors contribute to rickettsial growth in tick cells, as the tick vector remains an understudied niche of these pathogens. To overcome this, our group has developed a T4SS effector prediction program Optimal-features Predictor for T4SS Effectors (OPT4e). When applied to A. phagocytophilum, OPT4e identified 48 putative T4SS effectors. Transcriptomics finds that 15 of these predicted effector genes are specifically expressed during growth within either tick or mammalian cells. We have demonstrated that one of these tick- specific effector candidates, Aph1383, is translocated in a T4 specific manner by the Legionella pneumophila T4SS. Aph1383 also belongs to a paralogous family of six proteins encoded by the gene cluster aph1380-1386. This entire cluster is expressed 2.5-fold more highly during A. phagocytophilum growth in tick cells than during mammalian cell infections. We hypothesize that this family of Aph1383 paralogs are all T4SS effectors which target host cell processes specifically important for A. phagocytophilum growth within tick cells. In this study, we will first use transposon insertion mutants in the aph1380-1386 gene cluster to test the fitness contribution of these genes during A. phagocytophilum growth within tick cells. Next, we will evaluate the T4SS translocation of all Aph1383 paralogs and identify the amino acid sequences necessary for secretion. Finally, we will identify the subcellular localization and molecular targets of Aph1383 within tick cells. Characterizing these molecular interactions of A. phagocytophilum within the tick cell will open the door to development of vector targeted interventions to reduce transmissibility of the pathogen. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases account for >17% of the global burden of all infectious diseases. The ability of the tick-borne rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum to manipulate the cell biology of both mammalian and tick cells is achieved through delivery of effector molecules by a specialized secretion system.

"Niche signals in HSC genesis PROJECT SUMMARY Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have well established clinical applications in the treatment of heritable and acquired blood disorders. However, their therapeutic potential could be significantly broadened by engineering novel methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells or from directly reprogrammed adult cells. Toward this goal, we have established endothelial cell (EC) niche based culture methods that provide the necessary conditions to support the specification and self-renewal of HSC from embryonic hemogenic precursors, and more recently, from adult ECs using transcription factor (TF)-mediated conversion that bypasses a pluripotent intermediate. We hypothesize that recreating the signals necessary and sufficient to develop a clinically meaningful system for HSC generation in vitro will necessitate a comprehensive, systems approach to deconstruct the niche provided signals required for HSC specification and self-renewal. Thus, the overall goal of this grant is to leverage unique expertise of the collaborating laboratories to elucidate the signaling interactions regulating HSC specification and self-renewal from embryonic hemogenic precursors or TF-reprogrammed adult EC in the context of the EC niche. Our approach consists of three overlapping aims. The first aim will identify EC niche-provided signals necessary for embryonic HSC specification and self-renewal. The second aim will identify the unique HSC programs induced by these signals that regulate the transition from embryonic hemogenic precursor to bone fide repopulating HSC. The third will identify comparable programs that regulate the transition from adult EC to HSC during TF-mediated reprogramming in the EC niche. Key to these studies will be innovative functional assays, transcriptional profiling methods, and computational approaches that will enable us to resolve cellular complexity of niche cells and their interactions with developing embryonic or reprogrammed HSC at the single cell level. The role of identified signal factors in stage-specific support of HSC specification will be validated and further refined in vitro by gain and loss of function studies in the context of niche EC. Furthermore, to extend these studies to stromal cell-free systems as a step toward clinical translation, we will also test the contribution of identified signal factors in HSC specification and self-renewal in the context of stage-specific modulation of Notch activation using engineered Notch agonists. To achieve the goals of this proposal, we have developed a multidisciplinary collaboration involving unique expertise in each of our laboratories, including basic HSC and EC niche cell biology, direct TF based cellular conversion, clinical HSC transplantation, genome wide assessment of rare stem cell populations at single cell resolution, and innovative computational approaches to deconstruct core signal pathways regulating developmental transitions. Altogether, we expect the proposed studies will ultimately guide the design of novel strategies for deriving and expanding HSC in vitro for therapeutic applications. NARRATIVE Hematopoietic stem cells are currently used in the treatment and cure of a variety of blood disorders. Methods to generate new or greater numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in the laboratory could expand the availability and therapeutic applications of these valuable cells, but currently such methods are lacking. The goal of this proposal is to use lessons from endothelial cells, which provide critical signals to support hematopoietic stem cells, to engineer novel systems for the development and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in culture. !",Niche signals in HSC genesis,9979872,RC2DK114777,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Agonist', 'Aorta', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Development', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gonadal structure', 'Grant', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Specification', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Mediating', 'Mesonephric structure', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological Processes', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Stem Cell Development', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'base', 'blastomere structure', 'bone', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome-wide', 'hematopoietic stem cell expansion', 'hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'machine learning algorithm', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'receptor', 'self-renewal', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem', 'stem cell population', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,RC2,2020,640964,0.10102801569027012
"Targeting invadopodia-related mechanisms of cancer cell invasion and metastasis Metastasis causes >90% of breast cancer-related deaths. Tumor cell structures that have been hypothesized as necessary for metastasis are invadopodia, protrusions rich in structural proteins (e.g. Tks5), adhesion proteins (e.g. integrin β1) and proteases (e.g. MT1-MMP), known to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.  A novel, real-time imaging methodology that allows investigation of the in vivo metastatic role of invadopodia found that cells which assemble invadopodia move at “Slow” speeds and are seen in perivascular niches. Outside of perivascular niches, “Fast” motile cells, which do not assemble invadopodia were observed. This method also showed that invadopodia are essential for intravasation in vivo.  Preliminary work has begun to determine which aspects of the Slow phenotype allow invadopodia assembly. Use of novel mathematical models, in vitro microscopy and novel computational image analysis demonstrates that whereas the Fast cells continuously locomote, the Slow cells are in either of two oscillating states: i. Invadopodia state, in which a cell is sessile while it degrades surrounding ECM; ii. Locomotion state, similar to a Fast cell. The oscillation dynamics appear to depend on interactions between the ECM and its receptor integrin β1. Importantly, the Invadopodia, but not Locomotion state, is limited to G1 phase of the cell cycle. Release from G1-arrest amplifies invadopodia, implying that G1-arresting therapies may promote metastasis. This project will identify the mechanisms unique to the Invadopodia state compared to cells that only proliferate or locomote, with the idea of targeting the Invadopodia state.  Overall Hypothesis: the Invadopodia state, which is essential for metastasis, requires a pause in both cell locomotion and cell cycle progression. The initiation and termination of the Invadopodia state are controlled by the interaction between the ECM, invadopodia components integrin β1 and Tks5, as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (expressed during G1). Aim 1. Determine the role of the cell cycle in regulating the Invadopodia state. Using real-time imaging of cell cycle and invadopodia markers in vitro and in vivo, this Aim tests the hypothesis that cyclin- dependent kinases and corresponding inhibitors regulate the Invadopodia state, but not the Locomotion. Aim 2. Determine the role of ECM-cancer cell interactions in regulating the oscillations between Invadopodia and Locomotion states. This Aim will provide a strategy based on in vivo modification of integrin β1 activity on how to turn Invadopodia state ”off” towards metastatic prevention. Significance. Invadopodia is suggested as a new candidate target for metastatic prevention. The use of cell cycle inhibitors in patients with invadopodia may be accelerating metastatic dissemination. The long- term goal is to predict and prevent metastasis using invadopodia. This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of invadopodia regulation by the cell cycle and oscillations between Invadopodia and Locomotion states. Outcomes will reveal new invadopodia-related targets, which can be used to prevent metastasis in breast cancer.",Targeting invadopodia-related mechanisms of cancer cell invasion and metastasis,9918267,R01CA230777,"['3-Dimensional', 'Actins', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Biological Assay', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'EMS1 gene', 'Equilibrium', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Degradation', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Frequencies', 'G1 Arrest', 'G1 Phase', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Integrins', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'MMP14 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Metalloproteases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Prevention', 'Proliferating', 'Proteins', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scaffolding Protein', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cancer cell', 'cell motility', 'chemotherapy', 'crosslink', 'cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'intravital microscopy', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'loss of function', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'protease E', 'real-time images', 'receptor', 'serial imaging', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,390856,0.05723893971557873
"Quantitative SRS Imaging of Cancer Metabolism at Single Cell Level Project summary: Although altered cell metabolism is becoming an established hallmark of cancer, there remains a crucial need of new tools for quantitation of metabolites at single living cell level. In particular, due to lack of specific labels for metabolites, there is an unmet need for high-resolution imaging tools capable of mapping metabolites and small molecules (fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids) that play essential roles in pathogenesis of cancer. Supported by a R21 grant through the IMAT program, our team partially addressed this need via developing a multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, which enabled vibrational imaging of metabolites in live tumor cells and intact biopsies at the speed of 5 microseconds per spectrum. This R33 application aims to push the hyperspectral stimulated Raman imaging technology to the next level through (i) technical simplification and validation, (ii) developing a robust hyperspectral image segmentation framework, and (iii) integrating the SRS modality with a commercial spontaneous Raman microscope towards broad use by non-experts. We have assembled an inter-disciplinary team for the proposed development. The three specific aims are: (1) Developing an easy-to-operate, highly sensitive line-by-line hyperspectral SRS microscope and validate its capacity for cancer metabolic imaging at single cell level. (2) Establishing a feature analysis framework for segmentation of hyperspectral SRS images using the non-parametric Bayesian model. (3) Integrating and validating the stimulated Raman imaging modality on a spontaneous Raman microscope. By completing the proposed development and validation activities, we will have generated a highly novel spectroscopic imaging system broadly applicable to analysis of chemical contents of cells and tissues for discovery-driven research and marker- based precision diagnosis.

"The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease Most investigations of craniosynostosis focus on the dermatocranium, the second cranial skeleton to form during embryogenesis that comprises the dermal bones of the cranial vault and facial skeleton. A completely separate cranial skeleton, the chondrocranium, develops before the dermatocranium to support the embryonic brain and other sense organs. Historically, the chondrocranium has been studied across the vertebrates and is recognized as fundamental to craniofacial development, but it is not well known to craniofacial biologists and has never been studied in the laboratory mouse until now. The chondrocranium is formed of cartilage and though parts of it ossify endochondrally, other portions begin to degenerate by about embryonic day 15-16 in the mouse. By careful analysis of whole mount and histological specimens, we have documented the synchronized deterioration of select chondrocranial elements with the appearance and superimposition of particular dermal bones of the growing dermatocranium. These observations signal the existence of a mechanism for the coordinated, localized expansion (dermal bones) and resorption (cartilage) of two developmentally and evolutionarily separate skeletal systems. Our project, supported by strong preliminary data of the mouse chondrocranium, is designed to test a central hypothesis: that the chondrocranium serves as a structural and functional scaffold for the later development of dermatocranial elements including the formation of cranial vault sutures. Based on the common finding that boundaries between different cell populations often serve as tissue organizers, we recognize the establishment and maintenance of stable boundaries that restrict the mixing of different cell populations as critical to proper development, and propose a research design that interrogates the chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundary as significant to the coordinated development of the skull. We will interrogate cells at specific sites to determine the processes that function to maintain the boundaries. Then using the Fgfr2c+/C342Y mouse model for craniosynostosis, we will investigate relevant chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundaries operative in the development of two craniosynostosis phenotypes: premature closure of the coronal suture and abnormal growth of the midface. That the chondrocranium is composed of irregularly shaped cartilages, many of which are short-lived, requires that we conceive new tools for analysis. We will complete development of an innovative system to dissect and reconstruct the chondrocranium in silico from micro computed tomography images with tight temporal control, precisely delineate chondrocranial anatomy in 3D over embryonic time, and establish the role of the chondrocranium in development of the dermatocranium. Achieving our goals will enrich textbook knowledge of craniofacial development by defining the role of the chondrocranium in the production of dermatocranial phenotypes, provide information relative to the pathophysiology of countless craniofacial anomalies, and reveal potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. Craniofacial anomalies are common birth defects that require comprehensive, sometimes repetitive corrective surgeries to manage individual cases. To ameliorate the financial and emotional burden on patients and their families, efforts are aimed at the development of preventative therapies but these require a thorough understanding of craniofacial development. We offer novel information about the chondrocranium, the first embryonic cranial skeleton to develop, and focus on mechanisms operating within boundaries between it and the dermatocranium that are critical to craniofacial development, in normal individuals and in craniofacial disease.",The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease,9847792,R01DE027677,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Apert-Crouzon syndrome', 'Apoptosis', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Birth', 'Bone Resorption', 'Brain', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Chondrichthyes', 'Chondrocranium', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Embryonic Structures', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory mice', 'Live Birth', 'Maintenance', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Osteoblasts', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sense Organs', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal system', 'Skeleton', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'bone', 'cleft lip and palate', 'coronal suture', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fibroblast growth factor receptor 2c', 'histological specimens', 'imaging Segmentation', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'microCT', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'osteogenic', 'premature', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIDCR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2020,523782,0.016074240444968142
"The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus The cochlear nucleus is the gateway for central nervous system processing of auditory information in mammals. It has been proposed that parallel processing channels are set up in the CN, and these form the basis for further computation at higher stations of the auditory system. Despite decades of study, enumeration of CN cell types is incomplete and CN circuitry is described only superficially. In neuroscience generally, classification and naming of neurons has relied primarily upon qualitative approaches based upon human observational capabilities. We have implemented and in some cases developed novel high-throughput and unbiased techniques for labeling, segmenting and classifying neurons in 3D, generated from large-scale electron microscopy image volumes. We propose to deliver a nanoscale map, or connectome, of the mouse CN with enumerated and localized cell types and their synaptic connections. This effort is unbiased because all neurons will be sampled. To achieve this goal, we bring together four parallel modes of tissue analysis for neuron classification: morphology, connectivity, molecular identity and function. We propose that connectivity analysis will define long-proposed parallel processing circuits that will be tested functionally using realistic biophysical models of identified cell types. Notably, the cochlear nucleus contains both amorphous and layered organizations of cells, which serve as templates for all other brain regions. By investigating the fundamental structure of this sensory center, we will establish principles of neural computation and methods for structural and functional phenotyping that will apply to other brain regions regardless of their particular neural architecture. Relevance to Public Health The goal of this project is to deliver to the auditory research community the connectome of the mouse cochlear nucleus. In the process we will refine and develop comprehensive and high throughput methods to catalogue cell types and their connections in any brain region, and will provide molecular phenotypes for cochlear nucleus cell types that may be useful in their targeted manipulation for research and therapeutic purposes.

"The Integrated Stress Response in Human Islets During Early T1D ABSTRACT The pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) encompasses a spectrum ranging from aggressive autoimmunity toward islet β cells to defects in β-cell function that arise from inflammation. A perspective that has been gaining traction in recent years posits that intracellular signaling pathways arising from the β cell response to inflammation can lead to the production of aberrant proteins that serve as neoantigens that initiate or exacerbate autoimmunity. This perspective has prompted our Team to identify and intervene in intracellular signaling pathways that affect β-cell resilience as T1D progresses from the presymptomatic to symptomatic stages. This proposal takes a multidisciplinary Team Science approach that is responsive to RFA-DK-19-024 to define and intervene in early T1D disease processes affecting human islets. The integrated stress response (ISR) is a cytoprotective process whereby environmental stress signals are transduced intracellularly to activate a host of eIF2α kinases. The phosphorylation of eIF2α halts general mRNA translation initiation in an effort to redirect energy expenditure to mitigate the prevailing stress. The translationally inhibited mRNAs and their associated proteins are sequestered into intracellular stress granules (SGs), the formations of which are thought to divert cellular signaling toward an emergency response. Our preliminary data suggest that the ISR is activated in islets during early T1D, and that the pathway linking membrane-derived lipids to the production of proinflammatory lipid intermediates may trigger the ISR and the formation of SGs. We hypothesize that the activation of the ISR and formation of SGs is an early cellular response initiating β cell stress in T1D that determines cell survival and can be monitored in pre- and early T1D individuals with minimal invasiveness. Our collaborative Team will test this hypothesis through the following aims:  Aim 1: Define the mechanisms of stress granule formation and their fate upon activation of the integrated stress response in human islets.  Aim 2: Determine the molecular events linking lipid metabolism, activation of the ISR, and stress granule formation in human islets.  Aim 3: Identify protein, RNA, and lipid cargo in EVs as putative biomarkers of the human islet integrated stress response and T1D risk.  This application leverages the expertise of 6 Multi-PIs in β-cell biology, lipid and eicosanoid biology, functional genomics, proteomics, computational modeling, and clinical islet studies. The impact of this project will be to deliver new knowledge on an unstudied stress pathway in human islets and to identify and validate biomarker panels that reflect this stress state. PROJECT NARRATIVE Type 1 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder that results from dysfunction and death of islet β cells. The identification and characterization of new pathways promoting stress in β cells would allow for the institution of defined therapies that protect β cells and their function.

"Discovery of diabetes-relevant ÃÂ² cell enhancers through 4D enhancer mapping, integrative analysis, and large-scale CRISPRi perturbation screens ABSTRACT  Enhancers are essential regulatory elements that together with transcription factors (TFs) instruct cell- type specific transcriptional programs during development, tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Initiatives such as the ENCODE project, revealed tens of thousands putative enhancers based on linear proximity, using criteria like chromatin accessibility, TF binding, and histone modifications such as H3K27ac. However, a main challenge of uncovering functional enhancers and assigning them to target genes lies in the complexity of the 3D chromatin organization, which can influence enhancer specificity and activity. Using an advanced chromosome conformation capture assay, we recently captured the dynamic rewiring of 3D enhancer networks during mouse somatic cell reprogramming and discovered multi-connected enhancers that we named “3D enhancer hubs”. Here we extend the 3D mapping approach to human primary islets, and compare islets from healthy and type 2 diabetes (T2D) donors to assemble a 4D atlas to capture the rewiring of 3D enhancer network in disease progression. At the same time, we plan to compare the enhancer network in adult islets to earlier stages of development by using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to generate early β cells and their developmental precursors. Utilizing these 4D genomic data, we will computationally nominate core β-cell specific enhancers relevant to β cell development, function, and T2D, and then interrogate these putative enhancers through large-scale CRISPRi mediated perturbation screens using hPSC-β cells. Enhancers identified from the screening effort will be further validated in an established human β cell line and primary human islet β cells. This proposal addresses a critical gap in the 4DN initiative, that is how to translate 3D genomics data into functional data with respect to gene expression in the context of human health. Successful completion of our aims will establish a paradigm for the discovery and interrogation of functional enhancers that instruct transcriptional programs specific to a cell type of interest, reveal unique insights into their mechanisms of action, and identify enhancers with relevance to human development and disease. For instance, uncovering functional enhancers could assist the identification of noncoding causal variants identified in genome-wide association studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE)  This project will take an integrative approach involving generating a 4D atlas of regulatory interactions during both development and disease progressions, computationally nominating diabetes-relevant β cell enhancers through integrative analysis and discovering functional enhancers through large-scale perturbation screens. Knowledge gained from the study will provide a conceptual framework for dissecting gene regulatory networks that instruct the β cell fate and function during development and in diabetic conditions.","Discovery of diabetes-relevant ÃÂ² cell enhancers through 4D enhancer mapping, integrative analysis, and large-scale CRISPRi perturbation screens",10117708,U01DK128852,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Atlases', 'B-Cell Development', 'Beta Cell', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'CRISPR interference', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Ensure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Human Genetics', 'Islet Cell', 'Islets of Langerhans', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural regeneration', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Somatic Cell', 'Specificity', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'clinical application', 'diabetes pathogenesis', 'diabetic', 'gene function', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'islet', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'precursor cell', 'programs', 'promoter', 'screening', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2020,717356,0.04814948370593559
"The Human Foveal Connectome The complex relationship of cone photoreceptor cells with retinal circuits, Müller glia, and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is essential to normal vision. Yet for the cones in the very center of the fovea that mediate peak visual acuity these relationships are poorly characterized. A longstanding barrier to a comprehensive understanding of cellular and subcellular foveal structure is the myriad interactions among a great diversity of cell types embedded and miniaturized within a complex three-dimensional architecture. The broad long-term objective of this new research program is to elucidate foveal microstructure directly by application of new methods of volume electron microscopy (connectomics). We will utilize retinal tissue acquired from an innovative organ donor program that will permit pre-recovery optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to assess retinal health status and foveal pit morphology and to guide connectomic reconstruction. Preliminary data from two donor eyes demonstrates feasibility of complete reconstructions of foveal cones and their associated synaptic pathways, Müller cells, and RPE cells. The first reconstructions of cone microcircuits from an adult born preterm indicate that the critical cells and synaptic pathways for foveal vision differ dramatically in structure and localization anticipated from previous work on non-human primates. Therefore in Aim 1 we propose to localize, identify and reconstruct quantitatively the synaptic visual pathways that arise from the central-most foveal cones. We will characterize all of the bipolar and ganglion cell circuits arising from these cones and test the new hypothesis that the dominant “midget” pathway subserving spatial acuity may be highly variable across individuals in both circuitry and pit localization. We will further test the hypothesis that beyond the midget circuit the foveal center gives rise to over twenty distinct but as yet uncharacterized visual pathways. The first reconstructions of Müller cells revealed the intimate wrapping of cone axons and abundance of processes in the plexiform layer and foveal floor. In Aim 2 we propose complete reconstructions of Müller cells to test the hypotheses that the foveal floor contains a novel Müller cell type restricted to inner retina and that morphology of individual Müller cells and their foveal distribution accounts for the macular pigment distribution. The first reconstructions of RPE cells provided new insights on the distribution of organelles important in clinical OCT and autofluorescence imaging. Therefore, in Aim 3 we propose to reconstruct and enumerate organelles in RPE cells in the cone-only fovea and the mixed rod-cone perifovea. We will directly test the hypothesis that RPE organelle content and distribution differs between cone-only fovea and rod-rich perifovea, accounting for the appearance of OCT bands and for topography of autofluorescence signal in clinical imaging. This proposal combines expertise and innovation in neurobiology, pathology, imaging, and connectomics. Outcomes will impact retinal neurobiology, clinical image interpretation, and pathophysiology of macular diseases, especially age-related macular degeneration. The human fovea is essential for best vision but understanding the crucial cellular interactions among photoreceptors, neural circuits and supporting non-neural cells in the foveal center is limited because the extremely miniaturized and complex three-dimensional structure and synaptic organization of this region is difficult to untangle with conventional methods. The proposed project will apply new methods of volume electron microscopy (“connectomics”) to reconstruct the human fovea for the first time. Outcomes will have broad significance for retinal neuroscience, clinical image interpretation, and the pathophysiology of macular disease, especially age-related macular degeneration.",The Human Foveal Connectome,9883529,R01EY028282,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Apical', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cone', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Eye', 'Female', 'Floor', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipofuscin', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Melanosomes', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Mitochondria', 'Morphology', 'Muller&apos', 's cell', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Organ Donor', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Photoreceptors', 'Pigments', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal Cone', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Rod', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Supporting Cell', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vertebrate Photoreceptors', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Pathways', 'Work', 'cell type', 'clinical imaging', 'connectome', 'density', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'fovea centralis', 'ganglion cell', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'male', 'miniaturize', 'neural circuit', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'postsynaptic', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'visual performance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,505976,0.046968596029521845
"Determining lineage decisions and gene regulatory networks governing the generation of key progenitor cell types during early human brain development Abstract The long term goal of this proposal is to quantitatively understand how gene regulatory networks (GRNs) generate the diversity of cell types during the development of the human brain. The focus of this proposal is to determine how key progenitor cell types that are uniquely enriched in humans are generated. Such an understanding is essential for uncovering the mechanisms of human developmental diseases. There are three challenges to achieving this goal: 1. Ethical issues in working with developing human tissue, 2. Computational and experimental techniques to determine the sequence of progenitor cell states and state transitions that give rise to the diversity of cell types, 3. the difficultly in building quantitative models of the gene regulatory networks in the absence of data to determine the thousands of biochemical constants. The approach of the proposal is to build the necessary computational, mathematical and experimental framework to overcome these challenges. To recapitulate early human brain development, the proposal will employ an in vitro human embryonic stem cell differentiation system. To obtain snapshots of the underlying gene regulatory network, high throughput single cell sequencing will be employed to obtain transcriptional profiles of thousands of single cells during the course of development. The challenge of inferring the sequence of cell states and cell state transitions will be overcome through a novel statistical method to obtain a joint probability distribution of the cell states, sequence of transitions and a key set of genes whose dynamics reflect these states and transitions. The inferences will be tested by mapping to in vivo data and using viral lineage tracing. The origins of forebrain and outer radial glial cells (oRG) progenitors uniquely enriched in the developing human forebrain will thus be determined. The challenge of building predictive models will be overcome by using methods from theoretical physics and ensemble modeling from statistics to build models that make probabilistic predictions. By using the available data as constraints on the model, the framework will extract joint probability distributions of all the parameters of the model. These distribution functions will then be used to produce probabilistic predictions about the responses of the underlying GRNs to perturbations. High probability predictions will be tested experimentally by perturbing gene expression and signaling during early brain development and the model will be iteratively improved. The success of this proposal will result in the first quantitative model of the gene regulatory network controlling the generation of forebrain and the oRG progenitor cells. If achieved, this work therefore would represent a major insight into the molecular and cellular events that give rise to the disproportionately gyrated human brain. Narrative The project seeks to gain a quantitative understanding of the molecular networks within cells that control the generation of key progenitor cell types that arise during human brain development. To do so, it will develop modeling and computational tools as well as test these tools on human embryonic stem cell lines. In the longer term, a quantitative understanding of the circuits within cells that control development will allow us to uncover mechanisms underlying developmental disease.",Determining lineage decisions and gene regulatory networks governing the generation of key progenitor cell types during early human brain development,9968562,R01HD100036,"['Animal Model', 'Bar Codes', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Ethical Issues', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Forebrain Development', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'LHX2 gene', 'Lentils - dietary', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neocortex', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Organism', 'Physics', 'Probability', 'Prosencephalon', 'RNA', 'Radial', 'Regulator Genes', 'Role', 'SOX11 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'WNT Signaling Pathway', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'course development', 'developmental disease', 'glial cell development', 'human data', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'human fetus tissue', 'human stem cells', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'molecular marker', 'neocortical', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cells', 'subventricular zone', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NICHD,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,483538,0.060328850957447534
"Spatial Regulators of Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Disease Skeletal muscles are responsible for movement, breathing, posture and metabolism. Loss of muscle function via acute injury or chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) is debilitating to quality of life and is associated with high healthcare burden. In the US, there are over 12 million cases of sprains and strains injuries each year, an estimated 50 million people living with age-related sarcopenia, and another 250,000 with NMDs. My long-term goal is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms which underlie the muscle repair and develop therapies for chronic muscle disorders. A major barrier in this endeavor is our limited of understanding of the multiplicity of cell types involved during muscle regeneration. Little is known regarding functions of each cell type and how they interact with tissue-resident stem cells to regulate the restoration of muscle function. Thus, tissue cytometry, the mapping of single cells within tissues, is necessary to gain novel insights into cellular interactions during muscle regeneration and in dysregulated disease states. My central hypothesis is that local signaling in the cellular microenvironment regulate the behavior of critical cell types to remodel or repair the tissue. To this, I have optimized a novel multiplexed imaging technology (CODEX) that enables visualizes 40+ antibodies on a single muscle section. In the proposed research, I aim to (i) develop technologies to study cellular interactions using high dimensional imaging data and build a single cell resolution spatial map of the localization, abundance, dynamics, and interactions of 25 cell type within normal muscle regeneration and disease states; (ii) elucidate critical cell types and spatially-localized signaling that determine the proper expansion and differentiation of muscle stem cells; (iii) deep profile the function of M2 macrophages and fibroadipogenic precursors in process of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling. The training I will receive during the mentored phase of this proposal will be critical for the success of this project. Moreover, application of this systematic approach to study inter-cellular signaling will allow me to achieve academic independence. The proposed experiments in the K99 phase will provide novel insights into the coordinated process of tissue regeneration and will yield candidate signaling molecules with the potential to modulate the function of muscle stem cells. Further, the proposed project for the R00 phase will lead to better understanding of the cellular responses and fundamental mechanisms of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling, which has significant relevance for nerve injuries and chronic autoimmune neuromuscular diseases. Loss of muscle function in chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) is debilitating to quality of life and is associated with high healthcare burden. A major barrier in the development of effective therapies for NMDs is our limited of understanding of the various types of cells involved in normal muscle repair and what goes awry in disease. Here, I develop novel technologies to simultaneously visualize and study the interaction of more than 25 cell types in skeletal muscle, which will allow us to uncover critical interactions that determine efficient muscle regeneration as well as pinpoint disruptions in chronic NMD.",Spatial Regulators of Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Disease,10104351,K99NS120278,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Autoimmune Myasthenia Gravis', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Ligands', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Cells', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Muscle function', 'Muscle satellite cell', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Myasthenia Gravis', 'Myopathy', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Crush', 'Neuroglia', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular Junction', 'PTPRC gene', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Sprains and Strains', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'age related', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intercellular communication', 'macrophage', 'mdx mouse', 'mouse model', 'multiplexed imaging', 'muscle regeneration', 'myogenesis', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'new technology', 'novel', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'reinnervation', 'repaired', 'response', 'restoration', 'sarcopenia', 'sciatic nerve', 'stem cells', 'strain injury', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tissue regeneration', 'tissue repair', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,88722,0.09264306210405038
"Redefining mesenchymal stem cells: using their cellular and molecular phenotypes to determine their regenerative and therapeutic properties ABSTRACT Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have broad-based potential in regenerative medicine cell therapies and can be isolated from a variety of different tissues. Though MSCs from different tissues are phenotypically similar, a barrier to their clinical use is the high variability of their trophic and regenerative properties. This variability suggests that inherent differences exist in the molecular machinery guiding MSC properties between different MSC populations, yet, to date, these differences are ill-defined. To this end, we have preliminary evidence that MSC phenotypes correlate to their regenerative outcomes. In this study, we aim to elucidate how the molecular and cellular properties of distinct MSC populations determine their regenerative properties. Our hypothesis is that MSCs from different tissues have different regenerative properties which correlate to specific molecular profiles defined by gene expression and transcriptional activity. To test this hypothesis, the project proposed has three Specific Aims (SAs). In SA1, we will determine how tissue-specificity dictates gene expression and dynamic transcription factor activity of distinct MSCs. SA2 will determine how differences in the cellular and molecular properties of MSCs correlate to MSC phenotype. Finally, in SA3, we will determine how the molecular profiles and cellular activities of MSCs dictate their regenerative properties. Findings of the proposed study will provide novel insights about how the distinct molecular profiles of MSCs dictate their biological and physiological properties. In a therapeutic context, this would enable the development of innovative screening technologies for MSC therapies to identify and enrich for the most appropriate MSC for the specific therapeutic application. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Stem cell therapies are emerging as a new treatment approach to regenerate lost tissues, treat ischemic disorders, and treat chronic inflammatory conditions. Many of these approaches use stem cells from adults which are present in various regions throughout the body.

"Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics ABSTRACT Neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) have been historically categorized into discrete ""types"" based on structure, physiological responses, connectivity patterns, and molecular profiles. Heterogeneity can have other consequences- e.g. recent studies have found that some neuronal types in the retina are more resilient than other types to optic nerve injury, an event that leads to irrecoverable damage in vision. My project combines cutting-edge single-cell genomic technologies, advanced computational data analysis and molecular tools to define heterogeneity of neuronal types comprehensively, to connect molecular definitions to histology, and explore the functional consequences of this heterogeneity during nerve injury. I will focus on a tractable system, the mouse retina, which communicates visual responses to the brain. It is as complex as any other region of the brain (containing ~120 neuronal types), but benefits from having a compact, accessible structure, and experimental tools make it especially suited for detailed analyses. Building on my previous postdoctoral work, this project will, 1) Complete the census of the mouse retina, which will the first for any CNS region, by inferring molecular taxonomies of two of its most heterogenous classes (amacrines and ganglion cells) from data collected using high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using the mouse census, initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, which is harder to access experimentally, but shares important features with humans that are absent in mice. 2) Conduct a systematic investigation of cell-type specific responses in the retina to optic nerve injury. This usually leads to a rapid, stereotypic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but a recent study by my colleagues reported that some RGC types are more resilient than others. Here, using 1) as a resource, I will identify factors, cell intrinsic and extrinsic, that make these RGC types resilient. 3) Selective resilience of cell types is now recognized as a feature of diseases like glaucoma and stroke. Therapies therefore need to cater to different cell types. To learn more, and derive general principles, I will examine the impact of known therapeutic interventions on the survival of different RGC types, and the underlying molecular responses, within the optic nerve injury model. Taken together, my project will derive substantial molecular information underlying neuronal heterogeneity in the mouse and macaque retina and general principles for cell-type selective resilience following CNS injury in mice. The lessons from this work will provide valuable guidance for similar studies in less accessible regions of the brain (e.g. cerebral cortex).   NARRATIVE The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of a large diversity of neuronal types, a major proportion of which remain to be identified and defined in terms of molecular markers so that their roles in function and dysfunction can be assessed. This project seeks to combine high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics, innovative computational and histological methods to comprehensively define neuronal heterogeneity in an accessible system – the mouse retina, and use this as a foundation to (1) initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, and (2) study cell-type specific responses in a tractable model of nerve injury (optic nerve crush) to map the resilience of different cell types, and identify molecular correlates underlying these differences. Our work will create transformational tools to address similar challenges in other CNS regions.","Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics",10087165,R00EY028625,"['Address', 'Amacrine Cells', 'Animal Model', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cessation of life', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Crush', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Injuries', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'central nervous system injury', 'design', 'ganglion cell', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'injury recovery', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'molecular marker', 'nerve injury', 'neuroprotection', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'retinal ganglion cell regeneration', 'retinal neuron', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stroke-like episode', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R00,2020,249000,0.05446499553307485
"COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability of our immune system to respond effectively to pathogenic challenge or vaccination depends on a diverse repertoire of Immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors expressed by B lymphocytes. Each B cell receptor (BCR) is unique, having been assembled during lymphocyte development by recombination of germline encoded V(D)J genes. During the course of an immune response, B cells that initially bind antigen with low affinity through their BCR are modified through cycles of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity-dependent selection to produce high-affinity memory and plasma cells. This affinity maturation is a critical component of T cell dependent adaptive immune responses. It helps guard against rapidly mutating pathogens and underlies the basis for many vaccines, but dysregulation can result in autoimmunity and other diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized our ability to carry out large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) experiments. AIRR-Seq is increasingly being applied to profile BCR repertoires and gain insights into immune responses in healthy individuals and those with a range of diseases, including autoimmunity, infection, allergy, cancer and aging. As NGS technologies improve, these experiments are producing ever larger datasets, with tens- to hundreds-of-millions of BCR sequences. Although promising, repertoire-scale data present fundamental challenges for analysis requiring the development of new techniques and the rethinking of existing methods that are not scalable to the large number of sequences being generated. This proposal describes the development of a series of novel computational methods to explore the central hypothesis that: B cell clonal relationships and lineage structures can be computationally derived from repertoire sequencing data and used to define B cell migration and differentiation networks in health and disease. Specifically, computational methods will be developed to: (Aim 1) identify clonally-related sequences and improve V(D)J gene assignment through determining the Ig locus haplotype, (Aim 2) reconstruct clonal lineages, and use these to learn B cell migration and differentiation networks, and (Aim 3) analyze sequences to predict repertoire properties and sequence motifs that are associated with antigen binding or clinically-relevant outcomes. These through human a combination of simulation-based studies, as (myasthenia gravis) and murine (endogenous methods will be validated well as testing on new experimental data from both retrovirus emergence) systems. Allmethods will be integrated and made available through our widely-used, open-source Immcantation framework, which provides a start-to-finish analytical ecosystem for AIRR-Seq analysis. Together, these methods provide a window into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immunity and the dysregulation that occurs in disease.

"COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability of our immune system to respond effectively to pathogenic challenge or vaccination depends on a diverse repertoire of Immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors expressed by B lymphocytes. Each B cell receptor (BCR) is unique, having been assembled during lymphocyte development by recombination of germline encoded V(D)J genes. During the course of an immune response, B cells that initially bind antigen with low affinity through their BCR are modified through cycles of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity-dependent selection to produce high-affinity memory and plasma cells. This affinity maturation is a critical component of T cell dependent adaptive immune responses. It helps guard against rapidly mutating pathogens and underlies the basis for many vaccines, but dysregulation can result in autoimmunity and other diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized our ability to carry out large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) experiments. AIRR-Seq is increasingly being applied to profile BCR repertoires and gain insights into immune responses in healthy individuals and those with a range of diseases, including autoimmunity, infection, allergy, cancer and aging. As NGS technologies improve, these experiments are producing ever larger datasets, with tens- to hundreds-of-millions of BCR sequences. Although promising, repertoire-scale data present fundamental challenges for analysis requiring the development of new techniques and the rethinking of existing methods that are not scalable to the large number of sequences being generated. This proposal describes the development of a series of novel computational methods to explore the central hypothesis that: B cell clonal relationships and lineage structures can be computationally derived from repertoire sequencing data and used to define B cell migration and differentiation networks in health and disease. Specifically, computational methods will be developed to: (Aim 1) identify clonally-related sequences and improve V(D)J gene assignment through determining the Ig locus haplotype, (Aim 2) reconstruct clonal lineages, and use these to learn B cell migration and differentiation networks, and (Aim 3) analyze sequences to predict repertoire properties and sequence motifs that are associated with antigen binding or clinically-relevant outcomes. These through human a combination of simulation-based studies, as (myasthenia gravis) and murine (endogenous methods will be validated well as testing on new experimental data from both retrovirus emergence) systems. Allmethods will be integrated and made available through our widely-used, open-source Immcantation framework, which provides a start-to-finish analytical ecosystem for AIRR-Seq analysis. Together, these methods provide a window into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immunity and the dysregulation that occurs in disease.

"Functional and transcriptional analysis of embryonic hematopoietic stem cell development at the single cell level PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The therapeutic potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) could be significantly enhanced by methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells (PSC) or reprogrammed adult cells. Thus, there has been great interest in understanding the embryologic origin of HSC and the signal pathways that guide HSC development and self-renewal, such that the process of HSC genesis can be recapitulated in vitro, a goal which has yet to be realized. Given the heterogeneity and developmental asynchrony in hemogenic precursors during their emergence in the embryo, to achieve this it will be necessary to develop better strategies to isolate and characterize the rare precursors capable of giving rise to HSC and to understand the signals that drive their development to functional, engrafting HSC. To this end, I have established that endothelial cells (EC) derived from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region (AGM), the niche in which the first HSC emerge, can promote the in vitro specification and self-renewal of engrafting HSC from hemogenic precursors, including recent studies at the single cell level. Furthermore, I have shown that the Notch pathway functions in both specification and self-renewal of HSC in the EC niche, and that use of immobilized Notch ligands to activate the Notch pathway, along with hematopoietic cytokines, is sufficient to induce expansion of embryonic HSC. Building upon this work, the goals of this proposal are to utilize this novel in vitro AGM-EC system to elucidate the phenotypic, molecular, and functional properties of HSC precursors as they transition to functional HSC capable of long-term, multilineage engraftment. This will require isolation and functional characterization of HSC precursors across different stages of their development at the single cell level (Aim 1), followed by single cell transcriptional analysis to determine the gene regulatory networks and molecular signals promoting their development to functional HSC (Aim 2A). In studies working toward the engineering of stromal cell-free systems for HSC generation, agonists of identified signaling pathways will be functionally tested for their capacity to support HSC development in conjunction with the known requirement for Notch signaling activation (Aim 2B). Altogether, these studies will provide novel insight into the unique properties of HSC precursors, as well at the signaling mechanisms governing their maturation to functional HSC, which will have important implications in advancing our ability to generate HSC from PSC. To accomplish these aims, I will leverage the wealth of resources available in the mentoring laboratory of Dr. Bernstein, as well as key resources available at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the University of Washington, and Seattle Children’s Hospital, and opportunities for co-mentorship from Dr. Shahin Rafii at the Ansary Stem Cell Institute at Weill Cornell Medical College. A key aspect of my career development plan is to also acquire new skills that will facilitate my research objectives, including techniques in single cell RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis which will be performed in collaboration with and under the co-mentorship of Dr. Cole Trapnell in Genome Sciences at the University of Washington. This type of interdisciplinary training will provide me with the tools necessary to apply innovative technologies in unravelling the complexity of niche- stem cell interactions that instruct HSC fates. My research experience studying hematopoietic stem cell development has provided me with a strong background to facilitate success in the proposed research goals. My clinical experience in caring for children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has cemented a strong passion to expand scientific knowledge of HSC and translate this knowledge to improve therapies for children with hematologic, immunologic, and oncologic diseases. Success in my research and career development goals outlined in this proposal will enable me to establish an independent academic career as a physician-scientist with the skills to lead a diverse research team and collaborate broadly to address essential questions in stem cell biology. Ultimately, my long-term goal is to develop a laboratory-based career with focus on taking fundamental principles discovered through basic research in developmental HSC biology toward clinical applications in hematopoietic stem cell therapeutics.

"Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease SPATIAL EPIGENOMIC PROFILING OF IMMUNE CELL SIGNATURES AT SUBCELLULAR  RESOLUTION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE More than ten percent of childhood cancers are still incurable and need novel therapies. Epigenetic treatments deserve special attention with their specificity and reduced toxicity. Here I plan to explore epigenetic profiles of immune and cancer cells in normal development and blood cancer patients under the mentorship of Garry Nolan for single cell proteomics technology development, in collaboration with Howard Chang for implementation of epigenomic methods such as chromosome accessibility assays, and with Kara Davis for epigenetics studies of treatment resistant B cell subtypes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epigenetic measurements have been limited to bulk level sequencing and ligation assays or limited number of imaging markers. To address these limitations, I will use an emerging three dimensional (3D) proteomic imaging technology in individual cells, termed as 3D Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) or 3D MIBI. Epigenetics research by 3D MIBI benefits from high degree multiplexing (up to 100 markers) and super resolution imaging capability (20 nm x-y; 5 nm z resolution), providing exciting opportunities to study genomic sites, methylated DNA, protein factors, and chromosome accessibility, all within the same experiments in single immune and aberrant (leukemic) cells. To systematically determine epigenetic states, I plan to utilize clonal B cell lines to decipher variability of epigenetic components including chromatin states, protein factors and modifiers by a fifty-marker 3D MIBI panel (Aim 1). These experiments will show distribution of epigenetic factors (linear or log-scale) in their expression levels and spatial variations (global or local) in the chromatin states. I will then perform experiments with primary B cells isolated from six different bone marrow aspirates of normal human subjects (Aim 2). I will correlate epigenetic signatures of each B cell subtype to corresponding development state (progenitor, pre, post, or mature). I will then perform an ex vivo co-culture of primary B cells on OP9 stromal cells over 1-6 weeks of culturing, which will be followed by fixation and profiling by 3D MIBI. These perturbation experiments will show how signaling events from neighboring cells drive necessary epigenetic conditions that are required for reaching a B cell subset. Finally, I will turn to primary B cells that are isolated from twenty newly diagnosed ALL patients (Aim 3). I will dissect differentiation and spatial epigenomic remodeling of responder B cell subsets and treatment resistant B cell subtypes from bone marrow aspirates using the OP9 co-culture. These will show how treatment resistance arises from a single epigenetic state or multiple distinct epigenetic signatures. I will then screen Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on the same co-culture of B cell subtypes from ALL and stromal cells. By varying concentration and duration of inhibition conditions, I will dissect the role of epigenetic drugs in spatial chromatin remodeling toward development of epigenetic therapies in ALL. Together, these experiments will shed light on the role of epigenetic programming for cancer treatment applications from immune cell signatures in normal subjects and blood cancer patients. Public Health Relevance: Epigenetic alterations in immune and cancer cells regulate normal development and aberrant formation in humans. We reveal spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes in epigenetic states of B cell subtypes from healthy and diseased subjects using a novel multiplex imaging mass cytometry. Deciphering the role of epigenetic perturbations in treatment resistant B cells will guide development of efficient and safe epigenetic therapies for pediatric blood cancers.",Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease,9953964,K25AI140783,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Aspirate substance', 'Attention', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood Hematopoietic Neoplasm', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Cytometry', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Four-dimensional', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Libraries', 'Ligation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Technology', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'chromatin remodeling', 'design', 'epigenetic drug', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging capabilities', 'lymphoblast', 'mathematical analysis', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nanometer', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pediatric patients', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'sample fixation', 'shape analysis', 'single cell analysis', 'success', 'technology development', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K25,2020,107880,-0.009073280142545975
"Interdisciplinary Epidemiologic Consortium to Investigate T-cell Response in Colorectal Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The immune system has pivotal influence in the evolution and progression of many tumor types, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In particular, the presence of a strong T cell response in CRC, indicating activation of the adaptive immune system, has been associated with better patient outcomes. As such, recently developed immunotherapeutic approaches often attempt to harness the adaptive immune response. Immune cells are an integral component of the tumor microenvironment, and dynamically interact with neoplastic cells. However, our understanding as to the complexity of the T cell response and the factors that drive this response remains limited. The objective of this proposal is to identify genetic, lifestyle, and tumor factors associated with the T cell response in CRC, and to characterize the survival implications of that response. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will examine the relationship of personal characteristics with T cell response in CRC, including the role of (1a) germline genetic variation within human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes, and (1b) lifestyle factors (e.g., aspirin use, smoking, alcohol consumption). In Aim 2 we will focus on several colorectal tumor characteristics as they relate to T cell response, including (2a) the presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum and bacterial toxin genes in CRC, and (2b) somatic mutations in key signaling pathways (e.g., WNT signaling and RAS/RAF). In Aim 3, we will evaluate the associations of different aspects of T cell response with CRC survival, accounting for known prognostic factors and the relationships identified in Aims 1-2. To achieve these Aims, we propose to assess the density and spatial distribution of specific T cell subsets using multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) to quantify expression levels and co-expression patterns of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, and FOXP3 at the single cell level. This multiplexed assessment will allow us to examine the epidemiologic and prognostic relevance of numerous metrics of T cell response in CRC. This research will leverage the resources of the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR). GECCO-CCFR is a large collaborative effort between observational studies of CRC. We have completed genome-wide germline genotyping and have harmonized epidemiologic data regarding a variety of lifestyle factors and personal characteristics for all participating studies. We are conducting DNA sequencing with a panel of 205 human genes and a small number of bacterial genes in CRC tumor tissue. Prospective follow-up for survival is ongoing, and we have harmonized existing survival data. Through this project, we will add information on T cell response in CRC for >2,500 CRC cases to the GECCO-CCFR resource. This project provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the epidemiology of the T cell response in CRC and the relationship of that response with personal and tumor characteristics. Insights gained through this novel study could ultimately inform the development and targeted implementation of emerging immunotherapeutic and immunopreventative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE In this large, collaborative effort, we will examine how germline genetics, lifestyle factors, and tumor characteristics relate to the profile of T cells in colorectal cancers, and how those T cell profiles relate to cancer survival.

"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal for a K08 Award is motivated by two overarching goals: 1) to support the scientific and professional development of the candidate, Dr. Paul Reyfman, towards achieving his career goal of succeeding as a physician scientist and independent investigator with expertise in systems biology approaches applied to the study of chronic lung disease, and 2) to investigate whether single-cell transcriptomic profiling can provide novel insights into the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a deadly and progressive condition for which diagnostic approaches remain imprecise and effective therapies are lacking. Together with his mentors, Drs. Scott Budinger and Luís Amaral, the candidate has developed a comprehensive training plan that will ensure Dr. Reyfman acquires new knowledge and proficiencies in developing hypotheses, designing and completing experiments, analyzing data, and communicating findings to the scientific community. As an essential component of this training plan, the candidate will employ systems biology approaches to developing tools for analysis of single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated from patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is increasingly used to investigate the pathobiology of disease in humans and as a basis for developing novel biomarkers of disease. Developing and validating tools for analyzing the rapidly growing quantity of single-cell transcriptomic data is as much of a challenge as refining techniques for generating data from healthy and diseased tissues. In particular, it is not known whether analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) data can be used to quantify accurately the cellular composition of the lung and to identify gene expression differences between health and pulmonary fibrosis. Our preliminary data suggest that scRNA-Seq of lung identifies profibrotic gene expression in patients with pulmonary fibrosis that is heterogeneous between individuals. We also found that scRNA-Seq undersampled certain constituent lung cellular populations. Accordingly, we designed this proposal to test the hypothesis that single-cell transcriptomic analysis of lung samples from patients with pulmonary fibrosis can be used to identify disease endotypes. In Specific Aim 1, the candidate will determine whether snRNA-Seq enables quantification of the cellular composition of the lung during pulmonary fibrosis. In Specific Aim 2, the candidate will develop tools for using scRNA-Seq performed on specimens obtained from patients with SSc-ILD and normal controls to gain novel insights into disease pathobiology. Over the course of this award, the candidate will gain new skills including in generating snRNA-Seq from cryopreserved lung tissue, in lung stereology, in RNA in situ hybridization, in analysis of complementary genomic datasets, and in incorporation of clinical phenotypic information into genomic analyses. Accomplishing the proposed work will provide a rigorous training program for Dr. Reyfman and will provide insights that could lead to improved therapies for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The studies outlined in this proposal will be essential for future investigations that employ systems biology approaches to investigate the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis or to develop novel biomarkers of disease. This proposal will deepen our understanding of the strengths and limitations of single-cell transcriptomic profiling technology for studying human lung samples during health and disease. These findings may form a foundation for the development of biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of response to therapy in pulmonary fibrosis, and may uncover new targets for therapy.",Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis,9892329,K08HL146943,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alveolar', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Bleomycin', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Cryopreservation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Donor person', 'Drug Exposure', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung Compliance', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Specimen', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized approach', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2020,163296,-0.021804160674270646
"Genetic Dissection of Cortical Parvalbumin Interneuron Subtypes Abstract The inhibitory control and dynamic tuning of cortical circuits is mediated by a diversity of GABAergic cell types, but the biological basis of interneuron identity and diversity is not well understood. Here, we combine developmental genetic, anatomic and transcriptomic approaches to define and discover bona fide cell types within a broad class of cortical interneurons. Parvalbumin containing, fast-spiking basket cells (PVCs) are the largest population of interneurons in the neocortex and integrate in infragranular, granular (layer IV), and supragranular circuits, each with unique input/output connectivity. Recent findings from our laboratory and others suggest heterogeneity in PVC morphology, synaptic properties, and connectivity, but it is uncertain how many of these represent distinct subtypes. Using a developmental genetic strategy, we take advantage of the inside-out laminar specification of PVCs to identify and characterize subtypes based on lineage and birth time restricted cohorts. PVCs are derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), and the transition from progenitor to differentiated neuron is marked by the upregulation of proneural transcription factors. By intersecting inducible Ascl1-CreER and Dlx1-CreER mice with PV-Flp mice and an intersectional reporter and inducing in mid-to-late embryogenesis, we have begun parsing adult laminar PVC subtypes for multifactorial single-cell analysis. We quantify the laminar position and morphology of lineage restricted and birth-dated PVC cohorts. We will also carry out single cell RNAseq to analyze their transcription profiles. The integration of morphological and anatomical characterization with single cell RNAseq will increase our understanding of cell identity in PVCs and can potentially uncover new underlying cellular properties. Because PVCs are implicated in schizophrenia, autism, and other mental disorders, their complete profiling at the single cell level could aid in understanding pathophysiology and suggest better treatment strategies. Project Narrative Public Health Relevance: About 1 in 5 Americans are afflicted with mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and autism, placing a considerable burden on individuals and health care institutions across the country. Parvalbumin interneurons are the most prevalent inhibitory cells in the neocortex and their dysfunction implicated across many disorders, though their precise circuit integration is not well understood. This research proposal will lay the foundation for a single-cell understanding of the individual cell types that underlie this powerful “brake” mechanism and identify specific molecular targets that can hopefully lead to better therapeutic strategies.",Genetic Dissection of Cortical Parvalbumin Interneuron Subtypes,9853835,F31MH114529,"['Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Bar Codes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Date of birth', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Ganglia', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Myoepithelial cell', 'Neocortex', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Radial', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratum Granulosum', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Up-Regulation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'design', 'developmental genetics', 'differential expression', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genetic approach', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,F31,2020,35430,0.07699650567904417
"Mechanobiology of aortic smooth muscle cells in human iPSC-based models of Marfan Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY Marfan Syndrome (MFS), one of the most common heritable connective tissue disorders, affects 1 in 5,000 individuals and has destructive manifestations in multiple organ systems; notably the cardiovascular system. MFS is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a genetic mutation in the Fibrillin-1 gene leading to aberrant TGFβ signaling, and frequently results in aortic aneurysm, dissection, and death. Interestingly, the associated degeneration within the aortic vessel wall almost always occurs in the aortic root or ascending aorta and not in the descending or abdominal aorta; while this putatively reflects regional differences in hemodynamic stress, antihypertensive treatment alone is not effective in managing aortic aneurysm in MFS. Alternatively, it is also the case that aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), which predominate the vasoactive medial layer of the vessel wall, have heterogeneous subtypes stemming from distinct developmental germ-layers based on their anatomical location; Neuroectoderm (NE) origin gives rise to ascending ASMCs and Paraxial mesoderm (PM) origin gives rise to descending ASMCs. This project will use origin-specific ASMCs differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MFS and healthy controls to test a novel hypothesis that developmental origin causes location-specific abnormalities in ASMCs associated with medial degeneration in MFS. Additionally, it will explore for biomarkers of presymptomatic congenital defects in Marfan Syndrome to identify novel targets for prophylactic therapeutic intervention. These studies will characterize phenotypic differences in human ASMC subtypes at the cellular and tissue level with stem-cell culturing and vascular tissue engineering techniques. Using state-of-the-art core facilities we will also conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analysis on these cellular and tissue models to cultivate a rich biological profile for bioinformatic analysis. Furthermore, we will develop a bioinformatics pipeline to elucidate novel prophylactic targets inherently responsible for ascending aortic MFS-induced medial degeneration, using our uniquely combined phenotypic, transcriptomic, and proteomic results as input. Lastly, based on our bioinformatic outputs we will test our intervention on our human iPSC-based in vitro models and compare to treatment with Losartan, a commonly used anti-hypertensive drug that also exhibits unique anti-remodeling properties and has shown promise for managing the symptoms of MFS in animals and in patients. The training plan for this fellowship will focus on technical skills, experimental design and critical analysis, critique of published scientific data, and presentation skills. It will be achieved by regular mentor meetings, journal clubs, conference presentations, bi- annual committee meetings, and advanced coursework. The majority of training will occur in the Costa Lab at the Cardiovascular Research Center at ISMMS, a highly active and collaborative environment with available mentors and students aligned with my research topics and career goals. Additional training will occur in the Ramirez Lab with senior researchers in Marfan Syndrome and biochemical investigation techniques. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposes a bioengineering approach for investigating new human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based cellular and 3D tissue models of Marfan Syndrome (MFS), a rare connective tissue disorder that frequently causes aortic aneurysm and dissection specifically in the ascending aorta. Our findings will elucidate mechanobiological differences in aortic smooth muscle cells of distinct embryologic origin, and their underlying mechanisms of response to mechanical stimuli. This will help improve our understanding of aneurysm localization in MFS, and guide more effective therapies for MFS patients in the future.",Mechanobiology of aortic smooth muscle cells in human iPSC-based models of Marfan Syndrome,10054654,F31HL149271,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Actins', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Aneurysm', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Core Facility', 'Critiques', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descending aorta', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FBN1', 'Fellowship', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Germ', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Losartan', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Neural Crest', 'Neuroectoderm', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paraxial Mesoderm', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scanning Probe Microscopes', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Students', 'Sudden Death', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Vascular remodeling', 'abdominal aorta', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker discovery', 'body system', 'career', 'cell dimension', 'collaborative environment', 'confocal imaging', 'drug candidate', 'effective therapy', 'healthy volunteer', 'hemodynamics', 'heritable connective tissue disorder', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'lead candidate', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanotransduction', 'meetings', 'multidimensional data', 'nanoindentation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prophylactic', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'regional difference', 'response', 'scaffold', 'skills', 'stem', 'stem cells', 'symposium', 'symptom management', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'two-dimensional', 'vascular tissue engineering']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,F31,2020,43920,0.03913497384874691
