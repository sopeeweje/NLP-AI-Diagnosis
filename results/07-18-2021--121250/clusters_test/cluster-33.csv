"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically. The functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist.",High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors,10077788,K22CA234406,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR screen', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Characteristics', 'Chemoresistance', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Faculty', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Guide RNA', 'Heterogeneity', 'K22 Award', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Somatic Mutation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'colon cancer cell line', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug development', 'druggable target', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'homologous recombination', 'individual patient', 'irinotecan', 'loss of function', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'mutational status', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oxaliplatin', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'precision oncology', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'targeted agent', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K22,2021,192240
"Defining cellular states of quiescence in human brain tumors PROJECT SUMMARY The most aggressive type of brain tumor, grade IV glioma known as glioblastoma (GBM), is one of the few tumor types with both a poor outcome and minimal improvement in survival in the past decades. For GBM, like other solid cancers, intratumoral heterogeneity is likely an important factor in mediating therapeutic response. In particular, quiescent, G0-like subpopulations may engender tumors with more robust responses to treatment regimens and allow for tumor regrowth after standard of care (SOC). However, G0-like tumor populations are currently ill-defined, even after application of single cell genomics to GBM. Our failure to fully comprehend and experimentally model quiescent/G0-like states represents a critical knowledge gap, but also a key opportunity, for glioma and other cancers, as neutralizing G0 cells could effectively prevent chemoradiotherapy resistance and tumor recurrence. The purpose of this grant is to provide a functional and molecular definition of G0-like states in GBM tumors and their responses to SOC. In Aim 1, we will define molecular networks governing long- and short-term quiescent states in GBM patient tumors using a novel G0 reporter system in combination with single cell genomic analysis. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that dormant G0 GBM cells have unique RNA and chromatin signatures required for SOC survival and tumor regrowth. In Aim 3, we will study and nominate the NuA4/KAT5 lysine acetyltransferase complex as a key regulator of G0-like states in GBM and candidate therapeutic target. The Aims are built on strong preliminary data, including: the creation of a machine learning-based method for identifying G0-like cells in gliomas, integrated analysis of single cell RNA and chromatin analysis of primary and PDX GBM tumors with standard of care, a functional genomic screen to identify regulators of GBM G0, and key experimental models to functionally dissect G0 states in GBM tumor models. If successful, this grant will produce a new working model for GBM G0-like states, provide key genes and gene networks associated with G0, and analysis tools for identifying G0-like states in clinical samples. It will also define how these populations respond to SOC and shift tumor dynamics during recurrence. Finally, it will provide data for a new therapeutic strategy, ""downgrading"", where grade IV tumors are made less aggressive by triggering extended or permanent G0-like states in tumor cells. NARRATIVE Solid tumor recurrence is likely driven by slow dividing or quiescent tumor subpopulations in the primary tumor which survive treatment regimens and give rise to secondary tumors. However, we currently lack a basic understanding of molecular features of these populations and, as a result, do not have effective therapeutic strategies to neutralize them. The experiments described in this proposal are directly relevant to public health because they will identify and dissect molecular vulnerabilities that can eliminate tumor subpopulations resistant to conventional therapies.",Defining cellular states of quiescence in human brain tumors,10101272,R01NS119650,"['Acetyltransferase', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adopted', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cancer Model', 'Caring', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Experimental Models', 'Failure', 'G0 Phase', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Grant', 'HTATIP gene', 'Human', 'Indolent', 'Knowledge', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mitosis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Solid', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'chemoradiation', 'conventional therapy', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'neoplasm resource', 'neoplastic cell', 'neurogenesis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'prevent', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'standard of care', 'stem-like cell', 'temozolomide', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'therapeutically effective', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NINDS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,553130
"Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy Project Summary/Abstract The blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints has transformed the treatment of cancer for patients across a broad range of malignancies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is achieved by administering antibodies that block the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway to reinvigorate antitumor T cell activity. Despite treatment responses that are unprecedented and durable, the majority of patients do not experience a clinical benefit from treatment, and some responders relapse and acquire resistance. Moreover, response patterns of tumors treated with ICB are unconventional, and can be misinterpreted as disease progression by radiographic imaging. To maximize the precision and benefit of ICB therapy, identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to objectively assess immune responses has rapidly emerged as a clinical priority. The proposal aims to leverage protease activity as predictive biomarkers for monitoring ICB response and resistance. Proteases play a central role in the underlying biology of immunity, oncology, and anti-tumor responses. The mark of a “hot” tumor is signified by an effective immune infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells that lyse cancer cells via the classical perforin- and granzyme-mediated pathway – the latter of which comprise a family of potent serine proteases. Tumor expression of proteases, including inflammatory and matrix degrading proteases, is well-established as a hallmark of fundamental tumor processes including angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The central hypothesis is that quantifying the activity of T cell and tumor proteases early-on-treatment will allow identification of activity biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy and indicate resistance to ICB therapy. To achieve these goals, this proposal aims to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade antibodies that are endowed with the dual capacity to inhibit immune checkpoints and sense protease activity during treatment responses. These activity sensing ICB diagnostics, or IDB-Dx, comprise -PD-1 or -CTLA-4 antibodies that are site-specifically functionalized with a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates. During responses to ICB, these peptides are cleaved by T cell and tumor proteases that are elevated in “hot” tumors, liberating a unique fingerprint of mass barcodes that are then filtered into the recipient’s urine for quantification by mass spectrometry. By applying machine learning algorithms, these signatures of protease activity are trained and validated as predictive classifiers to discriminate “hot” and “cold” tumors, responders from non-responders, and resistance to therapy. Project Narrative Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade is transforming the treatment of cancer patients. Although some patients experience durable responses, new methods are required to identify patient responders, evaluate unconventional immune responses, and detect immune resistance. We propose to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade therapies that harness protease activity for predictive monitoring of treatment response and resistance.",Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy,10116320,R01CA237210,"['Antibodies', 'Antitumor Response', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caspase', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granzyme', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Inflammatory', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Peptidyltransferase', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Recombinants', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serine Protease', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinalysis', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'humanized mouse', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'perforin', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'pharmacodynamic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'resistance mechanism', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'sortase', 'success', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,339613
"Integrative molecular dissection of acquired resistance to PD1/PD-L1 blockade in localized and metastatic urothelial carcinoma Project Summary/Abstract Metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) is generally incurable with modest survival benefit provided by first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy and post-platinum PD1/L1 inhibitor therapy. Optimal therapy for progressive mUC following PD1/L1 inhibitors is necessary with new agents for this setting (enfortumab vedotin, erdafitinib) providing modest incremental benefits coupled with toxicities. Limited data exist for analysis of tumor acquired after PD1/L1 inhibitor systemic therapy, which is necessary to determine causes of both response and resistance. Indeed, multiplatform analyses of post-PD1/L1 inhibitor UC tumor have not been reported. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that tumor, immune and stromal microenvironmental factors determine resistance to PD-1/L1 therapy mUC, and that integrated bulk and single cell molecular dissection of post-treatment tumors will reveal these features. We propose innovative and potentially transformative multiplatform longitudinally obtained bulk and/or single cell (sc) analysis of pre and post PD1/L1 inhibitor tumor tissue and plasma from muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and mUC to shed deep insights regarding tumor biology and resistance and information that can be used to develop new therapies. We will perform detailed multiplatform analyses on 2 separate cohorts totaling 170 patients: 1) tumor tissue obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor exposure or untreated controls (n=130) and 2) plasma cell-free (cf)-DNA obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor exposure or untreated controls (n=40). Whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA-Seq and orthogonal multiparametric IHC for immune markers is performed of baseline transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens and post-therapy tumors. Patients included are from trials that evaluated a PD1/L1 inhibitor (n=70) as neoadjuvant therapy preceding RC for MIBC, or who received a PD1/L1 inhibitor for mUC (n=50) and control untreated and temporally separated serial FFPE tumors without intervening therapy (n=10). scRNAseq is performed on a subset of post-PD1/L1 mUC tumors (n=20) to analyze tumor, stromal and immune cells. WES is performed for immunogenomic analyses using quality-controlled plasma cfDNA obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor therapy or control untreated patients (n=40). The functional relevance of specific genomic alterations and resultant predicted neoantigens is studied by examining functional immune and stromal readouts, which will shed insights regarding the immunogenicity of genomic alterations that can then provide the foundation for therapeutic advances. We will develop a novel integrated model using deep learning architecture to account for the stationary snapshot of the molecular tumor, stromal and immune profiles, and the time-based trajectory of clinical data to computationally aggregate heterogeneous data types. To summarize, this innovative study is expected to provide discoveries regarding determinants of UC progression following PD1/L1 inhibitors, an incurable disease setting with substantial unmet needs. Project Narrative Progressive metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) and muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with persistent disease at radical cystectomy (RC) following PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors has significant unmet needs. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that tumor, microenvironmental and immune cell genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic factors determine resistance to PD-1/L1 inhibitor therapy and metastasis in MIBC and mUC, and that integrated bulk and single cell molecular dissection of pre-treatment and post- treatment resistant tumors will reveal these features. This innovative study uses deep learning computational techniques to probe tumor biology of 170 patients to dissect the evolution of urothelial carcinoma resistance to PD1/L1 inhibitors and reveal potentially actionable therapeutic targets.",Integrative molecular dissection of acquired resistance to PD1/PD-L1 blockade in localized and metastatic urothelial carcinoma,10218294,R21CA249875,"['Aftercare', 'Architecture', 'Biopsy', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Blood', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Evolution', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Genomics', 'Harvest', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mononuclear', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Myomatous neoplasm', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'New Agents', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'PD-L1 blockade', 'PDL1 inhibitors', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'Platinum', 'Ploidies', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stromal Cells', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Harvesting', 'Toxic effect', 'Transitional Cell Carcinoma', 'Transurethral Resection', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell free DNA', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'exome sequencing', 'heterogenous data', 'immunogenicity', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'macrophage', 'muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'neoantigens', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optimal treatments', 'pembrolizumab', 'peripheral blood', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2021,476334
"Developing new therapeutic strategies for pediatric tumors that lack clinically actionable mutations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cancer is the leading disease-related cause of death in children. Treatment has remained largely unchanged in decades, relying primarily on aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation—these therapies have debilitating long-term consequences. Precision medicine has yet to make a major impact on childhood cancer because, while thousands of pediatric tumor genomes have been sequenced, most children have very few somatic mutations compared to adult cancers. This means targeted cancer drugs are not an option for most children and fewer tumor-specific neoantigens means most immunotherapies are ineffective. However, in the last 5 years, large-scale CRISPR and drug screening studies in cancer cell lines, such as the Dependency Map (DepMap), have shown that in many cancers, unmutated genes can also act as potent drug targets. These genes are known as non-oncogene dependencies. The overall goal of this project is to overcome the low mutation burden, by identifying the druggable non-oncogene dependencies of pediatric tumors and to perform the requisite in vitro and in vivo experimental work to move these therapies to the clinic. We will identify these non-oncogene dependencies by applying tools from machine learning to perform integrative analysis of large pre-clinical screening datasets (such as DepMap, CCLE, and PRISM) with patient tumor -omics data. This will allow us to nominate specific non-oncogene dependencies for pediatric tumor subtypes, defined based on, for example, whole-genome gene expression or methylation data. We will mechanistically validate the top hits using in vitro experimental assays. Additionally, almost all curative cancer treatments involve the rational combination of multiple therapies, however, existing methods to predict effective combinations perform poorly when tested on unseen data. Thus, our second aim is to apply an approach that we have developed based on targeted CRISPR knockout screening to identify synergistic drug combinations. We will validate these combinations in vivo using mouse models with patient-derived xenografts, leveraging shared resources already established at St. Jude. Finally, tumor heterogeneity is ultimately the downfall of every known cancer treatment; however, in pediatric tumors where the mutation burden is low, much of this heterogeneity is driven by cell state, rather than specific somatic mutations. We will dissect the influence of cell state on drug resistance using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics technologies applied to a drug-treated spontaneous mouse model of neuroblastoma. This will ultimately allow us to nominate new drug combinations explicitly targeting drug-resistant cell states. Overall, this research program will aim to build a pipeline at St. Jude to overcome some of the main challenges posed by the low number of somatic mutations in pediatric tumors and identify new therapeutic strategies for these patients. We have assembled a diverse world-class team of researchers with all components necessary for an eventual impact on patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE The treatment of pediatric cancers has remained largely unchanged in decades, relying primarily on aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation, however, these therapies have debilitating long-term consequences. We will use new computational methodologies applied to large preclinical screening data from cancer cell lines and patient -omics datasets to investigate unmutated genes as potential drug targets in pediatric cancers (non-oncogene dependencies). We will perform the requisite downstream experimental work, including studying drug combinations and resistance mechanisms, necessary to motivate the clinical translation of our findings.",Developing new therapeutic strategies for pediatric tumors that lack clinically actionable mutations,10184211,R01CA260060,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bone neoplasms', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Cancer Treatment', 'Childhood Solid Neoplasm', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Encyclopedias', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resource Sharing', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical translation', 'clinically actionable', 'disorder subtype', 'genome sequencing', 'high risk', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mouse model', 'neoantigens', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'resistance mechanism', 'resistance mutation', 'response', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'synergism', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole genome']",NCI,ST.

"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,10159875,R00CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'refractory cancer', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R00,2021,153920
"Novel Radiomics for Predicting Response to Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer ABSTRACT: In 2019, an estimated 228,150 patients in the US are expected to be diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A recent landmark development has been the approval of the immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1) for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC. These immunotherapy (IO) drugs have an excellent toxicity profile and have the potential to induce durable clinically meaningful responses. However, only 1 in 5 NSCLC patients treated with IO will have a favorable response. Unfortunately, the current tissue based biomarker approach to selecting patients for these treatments is sub- optimal due to the dynamic nature of the interaction of the immune system with the tumor. Given the prohibitive costs associated with IO (>$200K/year per patient), there is a critical unmet need for predictive biomarkers to identify which patients will not benefit from IO. Additionally, the current clinical standard to evaluating tumor response (i.e. RECIST and irRC which evaluate change in tumor size and nodule disappearance) is sub-optimal in evaluating early clinical benefit from IO drugs. This is due at least in part to the fact that some patients undergoing IO present apparent disease progression (pseudo-progression) on post-treatment CT scans.  Unlike the standard canon of radiomics (computer extracted features from radiographic scans) that assess textural or shape patterns, our group has been developing novel computer vision strategies to capture patterns of peri-tumoral heterogeneity (outside the tumor) and tumor vasculature from CT scans. In N>300 patients, our group has shown that (1) radiomics of vessel tortuosity on baseline, pre-treatment CT for NSCLC patients undergoing IO were significantly different between responders (less tortuous) and non-responders (more tortuous), (2) serial changes in these measurements were better predictors of early response to IO compared to clinical response criteria such as RECIST and irRC and (3) these radiomic attributes were associated with PD-L1 expression and degree of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes on baseline biopsies. Critically, these radiomic features predicted response for NSCLC patients treated with 3 different IO agents from 3 sites.  In this project we will further develop vasculature, peri- and intra-tumoral radiomic features for monitoring and predicting benefit and early response for NSCLC patients treated with IO. We will uniquely train our radiomics using a set of N>180 resected NSCLC patients treated with first line IO and for whom we will have major pathologic response (MPR) as primary endpoint. In addition, we will establish the biological underpinnings of these predictive radiomic signatures by evaluating their association with the morphology, immune landscape (from biopsies) and molecular pathways of the tumor. In addition we have access to N>700 NSCLC patients treated on completed clinical trials via our industry partners (Astrazeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb) for tool validation. Finally, we will deploy LunIOTx within the ECOG-5163 (INSIGNA) trial (N>600), the first time that radiomics will be evaluated within a prospective cooperative group clinical trial for IO. RELEVANCE: Only 1 in 5 lung cancer patients treated with immunotherapy (IO) has a favorable response. Additionally, the cost of IO is extremely high, >$200K/year per patient. The goal of this project is to develop novel computational radiomic tools which in conjunction with routine CT scans from IO clinical trials will allow for (1) identifying pre-IO therapy as to which non-small cell lung cancer patients could potentially benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors and (2) quantitatively monitor serial changes in tumor heterogeneity during IO treatment for early identification of responders and non-responders.",Novel Radiomics for Predicting Response to Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer,10233147,R01CA257612,"['Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Antitumor Response', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammatory', 'Institution', 'Letters', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nivolumab', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Outcome', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Resected', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-PD-1/PD-L1', 'anti-PD-L1 therapy', 'base', 'cost', 'imaging biomarker', 'immunotherapy clinical trials', 'immunotherapy trials', 'industry partner', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'phase III trial', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic', 'prognostic of survival', 'prognostic value', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'success', 'survival outcome', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,619994
"High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy Project Summary: In prostate cancer (PCa), the presence and amount of residual tumor at the surface of the excised prostate is the only prognostic factor that is affected by surgical technique, vs. other factors, which are fixed and non-modifiable. Yet, positive surgical margins (PSM), defined as the presence of tumor cells at the inked surface of the removed specimen, are common, especially in advanced stage cancers, and are a strong independent risk factor for clinical progression and secondary treatment. In addition, elevated post-operative PSA, which is understood to be related to tumor left behind in the patient, is also associated with high risk of progression and secondary treatment. Thus, complete tumor removal is important to achieve to improve  patient outcomes and reduce overtreatment, yet there is a delicate balance between resection radicality and  minimizing damage to the neurovascular bundles to preserve post-operative function. The NeuroSAFE trial demonstrated that real-time detection and correction of PSMs by comprehensive histology of the prostate  circumference results in improved patient outcomes, yet there are no widely adoptable methods to achieve this. In an effort to address this technical gap, we have developed video-rate structured illumination microscopy (VR-SIM) and demonstrated that it enables accurate diagnosis of PCa in the biopsy setting, and that it can  rapidly deliver gigapixel microscopic images of the entire prostate surface for detection of PSMs. VR-SIM delivers the surface area coverage and resolution needed to detect PSMs, yet it is also fast and relatively simple and inexpensive, opening the possibility for widespread adoption. In this project, our interdisciplinary team of  engineers and clinicians with significant prostate expertise will further advance this technology towards clinical translation, by completing critical technology development steps and by prospectively validating it in a large patient series. Specifically, we will increase the mechanical automation speed of the device, and will develop a fully automated system for handling of the removed prostate, to enable gigapixel panoramas of the entire  prostate circumferential surface to be delivered within 10 minutes of removal and with minimal tissue processing and user intervention. We will then leverage our recently developed dual-color fluorescent stain that replicates standard H&E with high specificity, to develop expert-validated clinical image atlases using biopsies and  cadaveric specimens to enhance image interpretation of VR-SIM prostate panoramas. These improvements will be combined to test the system in a prospective 250-patient clinical study, to determine the accuracy of the device for intra-operative detection of PSMs and prediction of post-operative PSA based on measurement of PSM extent. Finally, we will measure and model expert reviewer behavior using a novel web-enabled visual observer tracking method, which could be used in future computer-assisted search algorithms to expedite  intra-operative image review. Successful completion will set the stage for multi-center clinical trials to validate the clinical utility of VR-SIM for real-time detection and correction of PSMs, and improvement of patient outcomes. Project Narrative: Achieving complete tumor removal in prostate cancer is an important goal to achieve because leaving tumor behind in the patient contributes to increased risk of cancer progression and need for additional harmful treatment. Yet, it is difficult to determine in real-time if surgery is successful due to the lack of available technologies for intra-operative guidance. This project will develop a rapid scanner that will automatically scan the entire prostate surface for residual tumor within 10 minutes of removal, providing images which are readily interpreted by trained pathologists and enabling real-time guidance of nerve-sparing prostate cancer surgery.",High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy,10172866,R01CA222831,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Case Series', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Computer Assisted', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Frozen Sections', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Ink', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nerve', 'Online Systems', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prostate', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface of the Prostate', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analog', 'authority', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'cancer surgery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computer aided detection', 'contrast imaging', 'diagnostic technologies', 'high risk', 'histological image', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neurovascular', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate surgery', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'technology development', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'visual search', 'web-enabled']",NCI,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2021,397823
"FAST-FNA immune cell profiling in HNSCC Currently, the single best predictive biomarker of response to anti-PD1 monotherapy is PD-L1 expression as assessed by immunohistochemical staining of archived or fresh tissue. Current workflows for PD-L1 assessment in tissue are labor and time consuming, are not infallible (inconclusive results in a fraction of image guided biopsies) and are associated with morbidity and are thus rarely performed serially. Rapid on site assessment of cellular, rather than tissue, specimens obtained through fine needle aspiration (FNA) could not only circumvent these bottlenecks but also enable more comprehensive and serial profiling of the tumor microenvironment to obtain the most up-to-date information of a rapidly changing microenvironment during tumor evolution and therapy. The goal of this project is to further develop and validate the new FAST-FNA technology for rapid biomarker discovery and validation in HNSCCs. There are two main aims. In aim 1 we will develop and validate existing and new biomarkers in FNA samples of HNSCC patients (n=100). Specifically we will I) develop and validate new predictive immunotherapeutic biomarkers and ii to determine how well the new FAST-FNA scores correlate with the CPS scores of PD-L1. The goal of the second aim is to translate the above FAST-FNA technology to serial FNA analyses in HNSCC patients receiving anti-PD1 immunotherapy (with or without chemotherapy; n=100). FNA sampling will be performed pre- and on-treatment in order to capture changes in the tumor microenvironment. As the HNSCC field shifts toward increased biomarker testing, we find an unmet clinical need to develop advanced cellular diagnostics in HNSCCs, which will facilitate rapid biomarker analysis, guide therapies and provide “real time” assessment of clinical response. Existing analysis of HNSCC cancer tissues obtained by core biopsy is limited in many aspects. We have developed a new immune and cancer cell profiling technology based on cellular immunocycling. Using fine needle aspirates (FNA) rather than more invasive core biopsies, this method allows frequent and serial profiling on the composition of the tumor microenvironment in HNSCC patients undergoing immunotherapy.",FAST-FNA immune cell profiling in HNSCC,10154199,R01CA257623,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments', 'Clinical assessments', 'Consumption', 'Core Biopsy', 'Diagnostic', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Human', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Needles', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Quality Control', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sedation procedure', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Harvesting', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer cell', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'companion diagnostics', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'therapy outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,670725
"Rational translation of gold nanoparticle mediated radiosensitization tothe clinic The use of high atomic number (Z) elements as radiosensitizers of tumors has been well documented in the literature over the last few decades. In particular, gold nanoparticles (GNPs), typically defined as high-Z gold structures with the longest dimension smaller than 100 nm, have been the subject of active investigation for the same purpose for the past 15 years. Early in vivo demonstration of GNP-mediated radiosensitization (GMR) effect was based on passive accumulation of GNPs within tumors (“passive targeting”). While resulting in a remarkable level of GMR, this approach generally requires clinically less relevant radiation quality (low energy kilovoltage x-rays) and clinically unachievable (without direct injection) gold concentration (up to 7mg gold per gram of tumor). To overcome these difficulties, we have been investigating an alternative approach based on “active targeting” which shows a promising outlook for clinical translation in the near term. This proposal seeks to surmount the remaining challenges associated with our active targeting-based approach before embarking on clinical translation of GMR. Specifically, we aim to identify the molecular mechanism of GMR, biodistribution and kinetics of GNPs developed for clinical translation, their fate at the tumor and cellular levels, and the correlation between GNP-mediated dose enhancement and GMR. Despite abundant data and publications on GMR accumulated over the years, critical knowledge gaps still exist in terms of the aforementioned aspects, hindering clinical translation of GMR. As demonstrated in our preliminary data, we propose to address such issues that hold the key for clinical translation of GMR, through concerted multidisciplinary efforts. Upon achieving this goal, a pilot human trial of GNP-enhanced radiation therapy (RT) will also be conducted within this project for the management of recurrent rectal cancer. Overall, we will pursue three Specific Aims shown below to achieve the goals of this project. (1) To determine the molecular mechanism of GMR, the biodistribution/kinetics of GNPs in vitro and in vivo, and the radiosensitization efficacy in clinically relevant treatment scenarios, (2) To correlate GNP-mediated dose enhancement and GMR using high resolution image-based cell/tissue models and nanoscale computational techniques, and (3) To conduct a pilot human trial of GNP-enhanced RT for previously radiated recurrent rectal cancers. Ultimately, this project would lay the foundation for widespread applications of the currently envisioned RT paradigm that enables more potent and tumor-specific RT with less toxicity. Increasing the radiation dose delivered to rectal cancers treated preoperatively can improve pathological response at the time of surgery and possibly even obviate the need for surgery but this has been challenging to implement in the clinic due to the limited radiation tolerance of the surrounding normal intestinal loops. Gold nanoparticles that preferentially accumulate in tumors offer the possibility to increase radiation dose within the tumor without damaging adjacent normal tissues. To amplify this radiation dose enhancement, we propose to advance clinical translation of a paradigm using gold nanoparticles that home to the tumor, get internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, disperse in the cytoplasm via co-administered pharmacological agents, and can be modeled by mathematical techniques that predict the biological consequences of tumor accumulation.",Rational translation of gold nanoparticle mediated radiosensitization tothe clinic,10144062,R01CA257241,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biodistribution', 'Biological', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Double Strand Break Repair', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High-LET Radiation', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Injections', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Mediating', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nanotechnology', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmacology', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Radiosensitization', 'Rectal Cancer', 'Recurrence', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Tumor Tissue', 'base', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'dosage', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'ionization', 'irradiation', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoGold', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'radiation response', 'receptor internalization', 'receptor mediated endocytosis', 'response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2021,631688
"Network mechanisms and bioengineering of precision immunotherapies for glioblastomas Project Summary/Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal malignancy of the human central nervous system (CNS). This devastating disease has a median overall survival of 3 months from time of diagnosis in untreated patients. Despite the significant cost and morbidity with standard of care surgical resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, life expectancy is only extended by a few months. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are a class of immunotherapies with an FDA-approved treatment for solid tumors. These work by directly lysing tumor cells, which then release tumor antigens with danger signals that elicit antitumor immunity. Adenovirus is a strong candidate OV immunotherapy for GBM because of its low neurotoxicity when delivered by intratumoral injection and its amenability to bioengineering. Ad5-Δ24, an adenovirus modified to replicate in GBM but not in other CNS cells, is perhaps the most promising OV in clinical trials. Major hurdles remain, however, including innate immunoresistance. This study will overcome these by elucidating complex tumor-OV interaction mechanisms at the systems level, designing and constructing improved OV candidates that exploit these mechanisms, and then validating the mechanisms by experimentally testing the OVs. Preliminary studies for this proposal demonstrate that GBM patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have distinct transcriptomes in vivo and can be cultured as neurospheres (Sp-GBMs) under serum-free conditions ex vivo. Ad5-Δ24 OV can lyse several different Sp-GBMs ex vivo and the level of this oncolytic activity is PDX specific. Additionally, preliminary in silico models suggest that such OV activity levels are contextually dependent on protein-protein interaction networks in the target GBM cells. This project will test the central hypothesis that dynamic transcriptional states of human GBM play key mechanistic roles in Ad5-Δ24 oncolytic efficacy; therefore, modeling the emergent system behaviors will guide the engineering of precision OV immunotherapies. The first aim will classify human GBM PDXs using transcriptomes to predict Ad5-Δ24 OV responses and identify context-specific network features. The resulting classifier and network models will be validated by assessing their ability to predict the response of Sp-GBM to Ad5-Δ24 OV treatment. The second aim will elucidate Ad5- Δ24 OV gene dependencies and resistance mechanisms in human GBM PDXs. Predictions from both aims will both experimentally and computationally validated. Synthetic Ad5-Δ24 OVs with shRNAs that perturb these gene dependencies and resistance mechanisms will be constructed and tested for efficacy. These precisely targeted alterations result in the quantifiable, predictable phenotypic effects of modulating human GBM gene expression and oncolysis ex vivo and in vivo. Such synthetic OVs will be useful as GBM research tools. As a future direction, the big data generated will be a valuable public resource to further interrogate antitumor immunity and inflammation states. Successful completion of these aims will yield novel GBM diagnostic subtypes with paired engineered OVs ready for preclinical development as precision immunotherapies. Project Narrative Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common lethal brain tumor. This research aims to develop a novel immunotherapy using engineered viruses to treat this tumor with minimal side effects.

"Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas PROJECT SUMMARY Meningiomas, which arise from arachnoid cells, make up >1/3 of all intracranial tumors. While typically benign, these tumors induce clinical symptoms due to mass effect and peritumoral edema. In cases requiring intervention, gross total resection provides the best outcomes when possible. However, treatment strategy is ultimately decided by determining the proper balance between surgical difficulty and the patient's overall health. Two mechanical properties are important predictors of surgical difficulty: tumor stiffness and adherence to surrounding tissues. Knowledge of these properties before surgery would allow clinicians to more accurately assess surgical risk and identify the most effective treatment strategy. Mechanical properties are difficult to predict by conventional imaging approaches, but can be directly assessed by Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and related Slip Interface Imaging (SII). In published studies, we have shown that MRE-based stiffness estimates are significantly correlated with tumor stiffness in meningiomas and pituitary adenomas. Furthermore, SII accurately predicted tumor adherence in meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas. Still, challenges remain to make these findings clinically-impactful. For estimating stiffness, the primary limitation lies in resolution. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will develop a voxel- wise classifier of tumor stiffness. This aim will build on our recently published neural network-based inversion (NNI), which has demonstrated superior performance to conventional direct inversions in simulation and in the brain. In Aim 1a, we will advance NNI by implementing more complex neural network architectures and creating more realistic simulations for training. In Aim 1b, the advances will be validated in a phantom with inhomogeneous stiffness. Finally, in Aim 1c with the aid of our Neurosurgery collaborators, we will collect a large sample of surgical stiffness assessments. We will use these assessments to train a voxel-wise stiffness classifier, which will then be validated in a separate test set. This aim will result in a map that conveys both stiffness and confidence in the prediction on a scale that is clinically meaningful to surgeons. The most-pressing limitations in SII include the subjective interpretation of the images and the lack of spatially resolved predictions. Aim 2 will address these challenges by developing a voxel-wise slip interface classifier. In Aim 2a, we will investigate a neural network-based predictor of slip interfaces to add to our current methods. In Aim 2b, we will evaluate if this new method can improve predictions in phantom experiments. In Aim 2c, we will again leverage surgical assessments of meningioma adherence to train and test a voxel-wise classifier. The result of this aim will be a map of tumor adherence represented as an easily interpreted probability. Taken together, these aims will provide neurosurgeons with clinically-important information to improve patient management. More broadly, technical advances made in this project will impact the entire MRE field. PROJECT NARRATIVE Meningiomas are the most common type of intracranial tumor and are best treated by total resection when possible. The mechanical properties of these tumors are important factors in surgical difficulty, where soft, non- adherent tumors are more easily removed that firm or adherent tumors. This project will use Magnetic Resonance Elastography and related Slip Interface Imaging to directly measure these properties, providing new clinically-important information to neurosurgeons and patients.",Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas,10071162,R01EB027064,"['Acoustic Neuroma', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Arachnoid mater', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Skull Base Neoplasms', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'mechanical properties', 'meningioma', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neurosurgery', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,350595
"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,10180915,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stimulator of Interferon Genes', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2021,714132
"Do Tumor-Immune Interactions Prime Systemic Tolerance of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Brain Metastases? PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY It is widely estimated that 90% of cancer-related deaths are caused by metastasis. This statistic underscores our inability to manage cancer once it disseminates through the body, and our need to better understand the molecular mechanisms that drive metastasis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that occurs in 10-20% of cases. Taken as a group, TNBCs pose an unmet clinical challenge in many ways: (1) TNBCs represents the most aggressive and most metastatic subtype of breast cancer, (2) up to 46% of late-stage TNBC patients will develop brain metastases, (3) TNBC patients are at four-times higher risk of developing diffuse metastases on the surface of the brain (leptomeningeal disease), which is rapidly and universally fatal, and 4) women of African ancestry have an up to 80% higher likelihood of developing TNBC – making TNBC a cancer disparity. Previous studies demonstrate that primary TNBC is highly immunogenic, and immune infiltration is associated with improved prognosis. However, little is known about the immune environment in TNBC brain metastases and how tumor-immune interactions effect metastatic potential. Recognizing these pressing issues, I have chosen to focus my career as an independent cancer researcher on using a systems biology approach to uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie metastasis and race- specific cancer disparities. A comprehensive mentoring, research, and career development plan will be executed over the course of the K99 and R00 training period, which will provide me with the necessary tools to make an early transition to independence. First, to visualize tumor-immune interactions, I will construct an in-situ protein map of TNBC brain metastases using MIBI – a cutting-edge multiplexed imaging method (AIM 1). I will use a validated imaging analysis pipeline to quantitate the composition and spatial architecture of the tumor-immune microenvironment and determine the extent to which these features correlate with patient outcomes. In AIM 2, I will identify tumor-immune receptor-ligand pairs using single-cell RNA-sequencing on TNBC brain metastases samples. Lastly, in AIM 3, I will use MIBI to visualize tumor-immune interactions in primary TNBCs to determine whether interactions in the primary tumor microenvironment prime immune system tolerance of disseminated tumor cells enabling brain metastases. I will validate relevant targets by measuring their expression in patient cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), which contains brain-tumor- associated cell-free RNA. The results of my proposed postdoctoral research will positively impact public health as they will reveal key tumor-immune interactions responsible for priming the immune system for metastasis, and will generate the first “TNBC brain metastasis interactome”. My results will lead to the discovery of new molecular targets with the primary goal of reducing metastasis-driven cancer mortality. The K99 career development plan and focused research training will be critical to expand my skillset in biocomputation – a necessary component of my proposed research; as well as fill any gaps in my background, preparing me for a timely and successful transition to the R00 independent phase. Overall, the dual-phase award will significantly enhance my research, and ensure my continued contribution to public health and increasing diversity in science, as an established cancer researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE It is estimated that metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer deaths, with 1 in every 2 advanced staged triple-negative breast cancer patients developing brain metastases – surviving as little as 4.9 months after metastatic diagnosis. This work postulates that the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment reflects distinct tumor-immune interactions that are driven by receptor-ligand pairing; and that these interactions not only impact tumor progression in the brain, but also prime the immune system (early on) to be tolerant of disseminated cancer cells permitting brain metastases. The main goal of this work is to build a model that recapitulates tumor-immune interactions in brain-metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and use this model to identify novel druggable targets to improve survival outcomes in patients with devastating brain metastases.",Do Tumor-Immune Interactions Prime Systemic Tolerance of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Brain Metastases?,10115537,K99CA256522,"['Advisory Committees', 'African', 'African American', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Infiltration', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer health disparity', 'career', 'career development', 'data integration', 'differential expression', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'imaging modality', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'multiplexed imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'survival outcome', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,162617
"T cell mechanisms of immunotherapy response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Project Summary Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) provide durable clinical responses in about 20% of cancer patients, but have been largely ineffective for non-immunogenic cancers that lack intratumoral T cells. Most tumors have somatic mu- tations that encode for mutant proteins that are tumor-speciﬁc and not expressed on normal cells (termed neoanti- gens). Cancers, such as melanoma, with the highest mutational burdens are more likely to respond to single agent ICIs. However, most cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), have lower mutational loads, resulting in fewer T cells inﬁltrating the tumor. Studies have previously demonstrated that an allogeneic GM-CSF- based vaccine enhances T cell inﬁltration into human pancreatic cancer. Recent work with Panc02 cells, which express around 60 neoantigens similar to human PDAC, showed that PancVAX, a neoantigen-targeted vaccine, when paired with immune modulators cleared tumors in Panc02-bearing mice. This data suggests that cancer vaccines targeting tumor neoantigens induce neoepitope-speciﬁc T cells, which can be further activated by ICIs, leading to tumor rejection. Currently the impact of such treatment on T cell expression states and the underly- ing mechanism of therapeutic response remains poorly deﬁned. Comprehensive characterization of responding T cells will be critical in understanding mechanisms of response and providing rationale for combinatorial therapy. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that when used alongside neoantigen-targeted vaccines, individual ICIs have distinct as well as synergistic modes of action and that different treatment combinations result in distinct changes in the T cell repertoire related to immunotherapy response. To address this hypothesis, I propose two speciﬁc aims. Aim 1: To characterize the transcriptional changes in T cells during immunotherapy treatment. I will ﬁrst investigate the effect of PancVAX, with and without addition of ICIs, on gene expression at a single-cell level in the Panc02 mouse model. Then I will determine biological processes driving differences in anti-tumor response between treatment arms. I will experimenally validate these differences using ﬂow cytometry. Aim 2: To develop trajectory building methods depicting the clonal evolution of T cells. We will apply this method to T cell receptor sequencing data from human clinical trials of PDAC treated with vaccine and ICI to identify key changes within the T cell repertoire associated with tumor regression or resistance. Successful completion of these aims will inform future combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC patients and provide new open-source computational software to characterize T cell populations that can be applied to diverse cancer types. The skills I will acquire as I complete this research will prepare me for a career as an interdisciplinary scientist, characterizing the tumor immune landscape to inform precision immunotherapy. Project Narrative Immunotherapy has been largely unsuccessful in pancreatic cancer. However, vaccines can convert these oth- erwise immunologically insensitive tumors into those that respond to agents called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This project aims to better understand the mechanism of response when vaccines against tumor-speciﬁc antigens are combined with ICIs.",T cell mechanisms of immunotherapy response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,10139211,F31CA250135,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Allogenic', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Combination immunotherapy', 'Combined Vaccines', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease regression', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Grant', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'T cell clonality', 'T cell receptor repertoire sequencing', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trees', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'anti-tumor immune response', 'base', 'cancer type', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'effector T cell', 'exhaustion', 'human data', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'open source', 'pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'prevent', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'success', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer,10070579,R01CA210509,"['Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'BRAF gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infiltration', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Invasion', 'Supervision', 'TNM', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'supervised learning', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,407754
"Integrative Functional Profiling of Tumor-Derived Extracellular Vesicles PROJECT SUMMARY Clinical implementation of Precision Medicine faces major challenges in precision disease stratification and staging, determining optimal treatment, monitoring therapy response, and overcoming drug resistance and relapse. To address these challenges, there is a critical unmet need for better biomarkers and tests that complement current methods for accurate diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of response to treatments. Liquid biopsy presents an innovative non-invasive modality for precision oncology as it promises to provide a global view of tumor dynamics. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, are emerging as a new paradigm of liquid biopsy for non-invasive cancer diagnosis and monitoring. Exosomes are 40-150 nm membrane vesicles secreted by most cells and have been identified as essential mediators of cell interactions and signaling that promote tumor metastasis, drug resistance, and relapse. Despite the potential clinical impact of these findings, precise biological functions of exosomes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-mediated modulation of tumor microenvironments, and their potential clinical value remain yet to be determined. This is due in part to the daunting challenges in isolation and analysis of these nanovesicles with diverse molecular and functional properties. Here we hypothesize that functional phenotypes of circulating exosomes can provide potent biomarkers for detecting early malignancy, monitoring tumor progression and metastasis, and assessing therapy response in breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, we propose the advanced development and validation of a nano-engineered microfluidic biosensing system capable of integrative analysis of both molecular and functional phenotypes of exosomes in one streamlined workflow. The research will be performed by three specific aims: 1) Expand the MINDS strategy to develop an optimal 3D nano-engineered integrative EV molecular and activity profiling (EV-MAP) nanochip platform; 2) Adapt and optimize the EV-MAP technology for monitoring tumor burden and therapy response using mouse models; and 3) Evaluate and validate the EV-MAP technology for potential applications to clinical diagnosis and classification of breast cancer patients. The new technology will confer superior analytical capabilities to substantially accelerate the functional studies of circulating exosomes. Harnessing exosome activities for diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic benefit presents a paradigm-shifting mechanism for precision medicine. While focused on breast cancer in this project, our research will ultimately create a transformative tool for studies of a wide range of bioactive exosomes in various malignancies to develop reliable non-invasive liquid biopsy of cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE The lack of reliable non-invasive blood biomarkers presents a serious obstacle to the personalized management and treatment of cancer, more importantly, metastatic and recurrent disease. Our proposal aims to develop new tools to investigate circulating exosomes as a new paradigm of liquid biopsy in solid tumors. New non-invasive exosomal biomarkers and tests could profoundly impact the clinical strategies to monitor disease status and treatment and in post-therapy follow-up, to detect early disease recurrence.",Integrative Functional Profiling of Tumor-Derived Extracellular Vesicles,10190320,R33CA252158,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease stratification', 'Drug resistance', 'Engineering', 'Epithelial', 'Evolution', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Face', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'MMP14 gene', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Mesenchymal', 'Metastatic/Recurrent', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nanochip Analytical Device', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer diagnosis', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug relapse', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'liquid biopsy', 'lithography', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'microfluidic technology', 'mouse model', 'nanoengineering', 'nanopattern', 'nanovesicle', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'patient stratification', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized management', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'prototype', 'response', 'self assembly', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R33,2021,354506
"New treatment monitoring biomarkers for brain tumors using multiparametric MRI with machine learning Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate novel imaging biomarker(s) that use multiparameter MRI methods to identify the true spatial extent of glial brain tumors. The standard RANO (response assessment in neuro-oncology) criteria define tumor extent as the region of bright signal on post-contrast agent T1w (T1+C) images, termed the contrast enhancing lesion (CEL), along with the peritumoral bright signal on T2w FLAIR images, referred to as non-enhancing lesion (NEL). Yet, the CEL reflects the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to contrast agent and can appear the same for both tumor and treatment effect. Likewise, though NEL likely contains tumor, current imaging cannot distinguish tumor from edema. These difficulties result in the inability of current anatomical MRI methods to determine the true spatial extent of glial tumors, a serious limitation for treatment management of brain tumor patients. We and others have shown that advanced MRI methods, including perfusion and diffusion MRI, are useful for assessing tumor grade, predicting outcomes, or distinguishing tumor from treatment effect. Yet, almost exclusively, the approach has been to extract mean values of a single physiological parameter from predetermined tumor regions of interest and then measure their correlation with the desired clinical index. Although this approach has been useful for initial biomarker development, it underutilizes the rich multiparameter and spatial information available, thus motivating the current study. First, two multiparameter MRI biomarkers will be developed to identify enhancing and infiltrating tumor burden. Then, they will be evaluated individually and in combination to assess the total tumor burden in comparison with the standard volumetric metrics in current use. The development and testing of these biomarkers will be accomplished in several independent steps outlined by the proposed aims. First (Aim 1), we propose to develop an MRI biomarker that gives the voxelwise probability of enhancing tumor burden within CEL, with early results showing the ability to distinguish tumor from treatment effect. Next, we will develop a multiparameter biomarker capable of identifying infiltrating tumor within NEL (Aim 2). These efforts leverage our previous results using artificial intelligence, recent advances in machine learning, and our unique brain tumor tissue bank with hundreds of biopsy samples spatially matched to imaging. Finally (Aim 3), the spatial extent of tumor burden within CEL and NEL will be tested in their ability to distinguish pseudo-progression/response from true progression/response, which is a primary question that confounds treatment management today. In summary, multiparameter advanced MRI biomarkers of enhancing and infiltrative brain tumor have the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how treatment is managed, ultimately resulting in improved outcomes. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel multiparametric MRI biomarkers that precisely identify regions of brain tumor within areas of contrast-enhancement and peritumoral edema, which cannot be identified using standard MRI. Powered by recent advances in machine learning, our approach has the potential to cause a fundamental shift in the treatment management of patients with brain tumors.",New treatment monitoring biomarkers for brain tumors using multiparametric MRI with machine learning,10220248,R01CA255123,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Edema', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Excision', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Lesion', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Markers', 'Work', 'bevacizumab', 'biomarker development', 'blood-brain barrier permeabilization', 'chemoradiation', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'molecular marker', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'tumor']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R01,2021,547655
"Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and aggressive malignant adult brain tumor, with grim prognosis and heterogeneous molecular and imaging profiles. Although the currently applicable treatment options (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) have expanded during the last 20 years, there is no substantial improvement in the OS rates. The major obstacle in treating GBM patients is the heterogeneity of their molecular landscape. Determination of molecular targets requires ex vivo postoperative tissue analyses, which are limited in assessing the tumor's spatial heterogeneity (sampling error due to single sample histopathological and molecular analysis) and temporal heterogeneity (not possible to continuously assess the molecular transformation of the tumor during treatment). Herein we propose to develop quantitative imaging phenomic (QIP) markers of a range of mutations of interest in GB. We will build on prior work on EGFR, IDH1 mutations and MGMT methylation QIP signatures, and develop an extensive panel of imaging signatures of 10 gene mutations, as well as MGMT promoter methylation, using machine learning methods applied to relatively routine clinical mpMRI (standard plus diffusion tensor and perfusion protocols). Availability of such biomarkers can contribute to non-invasive i) patient stratification into appropriate treatments, ii) measurement of individual molecular characteristics. In particular, we propose to carry out the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (SA1): To develop the enabling methodologies for constructing Quantitative Imaging Phenomic signatures of GB mutations Specific Aim 2 (SA2): Establish QIP signatures of 10 mutations of interest in gliomas, plus MGMT promoter status, using next generation sequencing (NGS). We will use 709 datasets. Specific Aim 3 (SA3): Characterize the molecular heterogeneity of GB using QIP signatures, leveraging the NGS samples of SA1, as well as a new sample that we will genotype, adding to a total of 600 tumor samples obtained from 4 different locations per patient from 150 patients. The first 150 tissue samples are already analyzed as part of ongoing work. Specific Aim 4 (SA4): Integrate our methods into the Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk), in order to allow easy access to them by users This project will investigate the relationship between imaging characteristics of glioblastoma and its underlying genetic mutations/variants. As such, it aims to develop a number of imaging signatures of mutations that are important in GBM, using 1,159 (709 patients plus an additional 450 tissue samples of 150 of these patients obtained from different locations in the tumor) analyzed via next generation sequencing. The primary motivation of this work is to develop the imaging analytics methodologies and associated biomarkers that will allow us to evaluate the spatial, temporal and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastoma, thereby assisting in patient stratification and treatment.",Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning,10067573,R01NS042645,"['Adult', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiogenomics', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'genetic signature', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'molecular imaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'phenomics', 'predictive signature', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'receptor', 'routine imaging', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,642578
"Integrative Prediction of Therapeutic Response in T-cell Lymphoma by Omic and Spatial Modeling ABSTRACT The tumor ecosystem plays a critical role in tumor development, progression and therapeutic response. Previous studies have utilized dissociative and single-cell omics technologies to profile the tumor ecosystem, specifically to understand therapeutic resistance and identify predictive biomarkers for precision cancer medicine. Yet, very few of these biomarkers have adequate performance characteristics for adoption in clinical practice. We hypothesize that a fundamental facet of the tumor ecosystem, i.e., the spatial organization of cells, which encodes key information involving paracrine and juxtracrine interactions that drive “neighborhood- level” biology, can further inform predictive models. Recent technological breakthroughs in highly multiplexed imaging and spatial transcriptomics offer an unprecedented opportunity to delineate the therapeutic consequences of spatial relationships within clinical tumor samples. Quantitative spatial features can provide independent valuable information, which is unlikely to be captured by clinical, genetic and bulk-transcriptional predictors. Hence, we propose to integrate highly multiplexed imaging data with omic approaches to delineate mechanisms of resistance and build predictive models of response for patients with T-cell lymphoma, who have a desperate unmet clinical need. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will build automated computational tools to robustly quantify spatial features from highly multiplexed imaging data and integrate it with exome and RNA- Seq. I will utilize >100 primary specimens collected pre-, on- and after-treatment with the PI3K-δγ inhibitor duvelisib to nominate mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance. In Aim 2 (K99 phase), I will build an integrated machine-learning model to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from duvelisib and evaluate the impact of spatial features towards model performance. In Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will validate the model in an independent cohort and extend to samples from patients treated with additional agents, to identify consistent and parsimonious signatures of spatial features that could be developed for broader use. My extensive background in computational biology and experimental biology puts me in a unique position to accomplish this proposal. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators (Drs. David Weinstock, Peter Sorger, Jon Aster, Allon Klein, Peter Park, and Steven Horwitz) with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. I will acquire new skills in (1) computational analysis of highly multiplexed imaging to model molecular and spatial information, (2) data integration methods to delineate regulatory programs for designing effective drug combinations and (3) analysis of predictive biomarkers in clinical trial samples from clinical trials. Together with institutional support from Dana Farber Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital to transition into an independent position and establish an independent, data science-driven, translational research program. PROJECT NARRATIVE T-cell lymphomas (TCLs) are highly diverse and patients with relapsed disease have a dismal prognosis. The PI3K-δγ inhibitor duvelisib induces response in 60% of patients with TCL through tumor cell-intrinsic and immunomodulatory mechanisms, but nearly all responders ultimately develop resistance. We hypothesize that the integration of spatial data, including neighborhood analyses to identify para- and juxtacrine interactions, with genetic and transcriptional alterations will inform predictive models for duvelisib response and nominate mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance that can aid therapeutic selection and broadly applied across tumor types.",Integrative Prediction of Therapeutic Response in T-cell Lymphoma by Omic and Spatial Modeling,10115190,K99CA256497,"['1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase', 'Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Immune', 'JAK1 gene', 'JAK2 gene', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Non-Malignant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcription Alteration', 'Validation', 'Voting', 'base', 'cancer type', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'liquid crystal polymer', 'mRNA Expression', 'molecular modeling', 'multiplexed imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neural network', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'paracrine', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'random forest', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'single cell technology', 'skills', 'spatial integration', 'spatial relationship', 'spectrograph', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support vector machine', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational research program', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K99,2021,136080
"Image-based models of tumor-immune dynamics in glioblastoma ABSTRACT The use of immunotherapy to treat cancer continues to generate hope and excitement among those involved in cancer care and research. However, our inability to explain why some patients do not respond to immunotherapy, combined with our inability to identify early response or predict the responders, poses serious challenges in this field. Currently, biopsies serve as the most informative way to assess the immunological activity within a cancerous area, but we are spatially and temporally limited in the number of biopsies we can obtain from patients, especially in cases of brain cancer. Clear evidence of tumor-immune environment heterogeneity across patients suggests that we will have to use an individualized approach in order to accurately assess patient tumor’s specific immune environment and the evolution of these complex systems. We propose to use computational modeling and artificial intelligence to bridge the spatial scales of the cellular content comprising each MRI at the voxel level, but also to bridge the temporal scales. We will focus on the most cellular immune population in glioblastoma, microglia/macrophages, that constitute as much as 50% of the cellular content of tumor specimens. By fusing MRI with the biological heterogeneity found in image- localized biopsies through such radiomics approaches provides an opportunity to individualize our understanding of the the tumor-immune environment, broadly benefiting scientists across the fields of oncology and immunology. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of the tumor at every imaging time point, the radiomics maps can also be used to parameterize dynamic mechanistic models of tumor growth to allow for prediction of future dynamics. These spatio-temporal models allow us to test hypotheses about causal relationships between different cell types and microenvironmental factors, as well as to verify whether the radiomics maps provide early dynamic insights into tumor response that can impact clinical decision making. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our inability to explain why some patients do not respond to immunotherapy, combined with our inability to predict the responders, poses a serious challenge to advancing cancer care and research. Currently, biopsies serve as the most informative way to assess the immunological activity within a cancerous area, but we are spatially and temporally limited in the number of biopsies we can obtain from patients, especially in cases of brain cancer. We propose here a novel strategy merging artificial intelligence and mechanistic modeling to reveal the spatial and temporal tumor-immune landscape within patients by connecting a unique resource of image-localized biopsies and clinical imaging for cohorts treated with standard and immunotherapies.",Image-based models of tumor-immune dynamics in glioblastoma,10107517,U01CA250481,"['Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Cancerous', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Edema', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Situ', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Variant', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer care', 'cell type', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cytotoxic', 'effective therapy', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macrophage', 'molecular phenotype', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'synergism', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2021,702579

"Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown that delivery of higher radiation doses to the prostate results in improved tumor control rates in prostate cancer radiation therapy (RT). As local recurrence mostly occurs at the primary tumor, particularly for high-risk patients, additional dose escalation is expected to improve the treatment outcome. However, the application of dose escalation for prostate RT is greatly limited by the tolerance of nearby healthy tissues that cannot adequately be excluded from the radiation field. This limitation can be overcome by dose painting, where a higher dose is applied to the prostate tumor only instead of the whole prostate gland. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) offers reduced treatment time, convenience, and possibly increased treatment efficacy as compared to the conventionally fraction scheme. UTSW is currently conducting a dose escalation trial using SBRT for high-risk prostate cancer patients with an integrated dose boost on MRI-visualized prostate tumor. However, prostate can move and deform during the beam delivery. To ensure the escalated dose is actually delivered to tumor regions as planned, a reliable tumor tracking method is urgently needed. While intra-prostatic tumors can be identified by multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) for treatment planning, intrafraction tumor tracking during the beam delivery is not achievable with mpMRI. In contrast, ultrasound offers a cost-effective and real-time imaging with high soft tissue contrast. However, conventional ultrasound techniques only provide anatomic structure of the prostate gland without the capability to differentiate tumor region from the rest of the prostate gland. Temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) has emerged as a new paradigm for prostate tissue characterization by analyzing the time-series ultrasound images with advanced machine learning techniques. In this project, we aim to develop, optimize and evaluate an innovative TeUS based intra-prostatic tumor tracking method to guide SBRT with an integrated dose boost for high-risk prostate cancer patients. The specific aims are: 1) Develop TeUS-based intra-prostatic tumor delineation for guiding focused dose escalation; 2) Integrate and validate TeUS-based tumor tracking system during SBRT; and 3) Evaluate clinical gain of TeUS guided SBRT for high risk prostate cancer patients. Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development and validation of a low-cost yet highly accurate TeUS guided system for targeted prostate cancer RT. With enhanced real-time visualization of tumor, the use of TeUS for RT guidance will lead to better treatment efficacy and reduced toxicity. Delivery of higher radiation doses to the tumor region can improve outcome of radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer patients. As the prostate can move and deform during radiation beam delivery, there is an urgent need for a reliable method to ensure escalated dose is delivered to the tumor region as planned. We will develop, integrate and evaluate a novel prostate tumor tracking method based on temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) to guide radiation therapy for high-risk patients, which will lead to higher local control with improved toxicity.",Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT,10107816,R01EB027898,"['Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Probability', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Prostatic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'advanced prostate cancer', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'early phase trial', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate cancer risk', 'prostate lesions', 'real-time images', 'soft tissue', 'standard care', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'vibration']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,344156
"Quantitative MRI for Pediatric Optic Pathway Glioma Treatment Response ABSTRACT  Low-grade glioma is the most common brain tumor in children and often involves one or more structures of the anterior visual pathway (i.e., optic nerves, chiasm and tracts). Nearly 20% of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) will develop a low-grade glioma of the anterior visual pathway, which are called optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). NF1-OPGs are not amenable to surgical resection and can cause permanent vision loss ranging from a mild decline in visual acuity to complete blindness. Children with NF1-OPGs typically experience vision loss between 1 and 8 years of age and are monitored with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess disease progression. However, traditional two-dimensional (2D) measures of tumor size are not appropriate to assess change over time and how NF1-OPGs are responding to treatment.  Our proposal addresses the lack of robust and standardized quantitative imaging (QI) tools and methods needed for NF1-OPG clinical trials. We will develop and validate a novel three-dimensional (3D) MRI-based QI application for automated and comprehensive quantification of these unique pediatric tumors. We will use machine learning algorithms to accommodate MRI sequences from different manufacturers and protocols. We hypothesize that the novel QI application will accurately assess treatment response in clinical trials. In this project, we will validate our QI software and machine learning methods to make accurate and automated measures of tumor volume and shape using data from a phase 3 clinical trial of NF1-OPGs. From these measures, we will create methods to assess response to therapy that will enable physicians to make informed and objective treatment decisions.  Our specific aims are: 1) Develop a comprehensive QI application to perform accurate automated quantification of NF1-OPGs; 2) Determine and predict treatment response using our 3D QI measures of tumor volume; and 3) Validate our 3D QI measures using visual acuity outcomes.  Upon study completion, our QI application could transform clinical care for NF1-OPG by identifying the earliest time to determine a favorable versus unfavorable treatment response. The QI application's ability to accurately measure treatment response, along with harmonizing data across MRI manufacturers and protocols, will standardize imaging assessments essential to NF1-OPG clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In children with brain tumors impacting their vision, physicians have difficulty determining when the treatment is working. We will improve upon the very basic and often inaccurate human measurements of tumor size by developing quantitative imaging tools to make accurate and automated measures of tumor volume and shape. From these measures, we will create methods that will enable clinical trials and physicians to make informed decisions about the treatment’s success and whether the child will recover their vision.",Quantitative MRI for Pediatric Optic Pathway Glioma Treatment Response,10197029,UG3CA236536,"['3-Dimensional', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Brain Neoplasm', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complete Blindness', 'Data', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Chiasm', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Glioma', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor Volume', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Pathways', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer predisposition', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCI,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,UG3,2021,446107
"Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients Project Summary  Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and aggressive form of brain cancer affecting up to 20,000 new patients in the US every year. Standard of care therapies include stereotactic surgical resection, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. After initial treatment, patient monitoring is guided by standard MR imaging performed at routine intervals. Despite these rigorous therapies, current median survival is only 15 months. Imaging is a central part of brain tumor management, but MRI findings in brain tumor patients can be challenging to interpret and is further confounded by interpretation variability. Accurate interpretation of imaging is particularly important during the post-treatment phase of patient care as it can help clinicians proactively manage disease through early, precise characterization of true tumor recurrence. Disease-specific structured reporting systems attempt to reduce variability in imaging results by implementing well-defined imaging criteria and standardized language. The Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS), developed at Emory University, is one such framework streamlined for clinical workflows and includes quantitative criteria for more objective evaluation of follow-up imaging. While BT-RADS has had success with clinical adoptability, it still faces hurdles reducing interobserver variability and improving objective classification of disease state.  This proposed study addresses an unmet need for unbiased, quantitative metrics for robust, objective interpretation of follow-up imaging for GBM patients. Where previous evaluative methods used two-dimensional, representative MRI slices for evaluating the extent of tumor, we propose to develop a deep learning segmentation tool, accurately calculating volumes of tumor after surgical resection, and trained from our expansive database of patient data with contours manually drawn by radiation oncologists. Further, we propose to develop computationally advanced software for predicting disease progression building upon the clinically developed BT- RADS criteria. Such tools would assist physicians in caring for brain tumor patients through post-treatment surveillance and guide future clinical decision making. In addition, we believe these quantitative metrics would have unbounded potential in clinical trial settings where it may be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutics for GBM. Therefore, these assistive tools will be tested on clinical trial data to determine if they are superior to conventional measurements alone.  A fundamental goal of this proposal is ensuring the quantitative tools we develop are applicable for clinicians in their daily lives. Therefore, an effort will be made to collaborate extensively with clinicians to house the algorithms in sleek, intuitive software for physicians to utilize. Through the multidisciplinary environment, high performance computing, and clinical resources we have available, we believe this proposal will be successful in developing clinically assistive tools for unbiased, objective monitoring of GBM patients in clinical settings and evaluation of novel therapies in research settings. Project Narrative  Follow-up imaging for glioblastoma patients is challenging to interpret due to subjectivity in evaluating disease state and overlap between treatment effects and tumor progression. More objective follow-up criteria are vital for sensitive and accurate monitoring of glioblastoma patients after initial treatment to ensure proactive management of disease and accurate characterization of tumor recurrence. This research proposal will develop user-friendly quantitative software for lesion segmentation and disease-state assessment, providing unbiased metrics for post-treatment patient monitoring and guidance of management decisions in clinical and research settings.",Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients,10071871,F31CA247564,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Information Systems', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'aggressive therapy', 'automated image analysis', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'efficacy evaluation', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'implementation framework', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'quantitative imaging', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,10137898,R01CA236793,"['Benign', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'radiologist', 'tumor', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,311975
"Applying pathomics to establish a biosignature for aggressive skin melanoma. PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to develop a pathomics biosignature for aggressive melanoma to guide treatment decisions for patients who have had a melanoma surgically removed but remain at high risk of recurrence and death. This is a critical need because patients with stage II and III melanoma have an approximate 30% chance of dying of melanoma over 10 years. Therapies have been shown to lessen recurrence risk, but they are toxic and costly. Identifying patients who have truly been cured by the surgery and are cancer free would be tremendously useful to guide patient care. It has been known for decades that the immune system limits melanoma progression and that higher levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) portend a favorable outcome. Assessment of TILs, however, involves a subjective determination by the pathologist using qualitative criteria and this approach is prone to inter-observer variability. One barrier to the development of prognostic biomarkers in early stage melanoma is that the tumors are tiny and most dermato-pathologists require that the entire sample be formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) for careful morphology analysis. In order to overcome this barrier, our team has developed and published three digital pathology methods to estimate recurrence risk. These biomarkers are based on the hypothesis that evidence of strong immune surveillance within the tissue indicates lower recurrence risk and include quantitation of TILs using digital software, staining for macrophages and T cells using quantitative- immune-fluorescence (qIF), and measurement of an interferon signature using NanoString technology. Each of these methods provides unique information about the tumor immune micro-environment. For example, NanoString provides genomic information but does not provide spatial information regarding the locations of specific cell phenotypes within the tumor microenvironment as qIF does. For instance, qIF revealed the macrophages confer a poor prognosis specifically when located within the tumor stroma. In Aim 1 of the proposal we validate three previously published biomarkers using 514 melanoma samples from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Institute, The University of British Columbia, Yale School of Medicine, and Geisinger Health Systems. Next, in Aim 2 of the proposal we propose an integrative systems biology approach including transcriptomic, qIF, morphology analysis of TILS, and standard clinical and pathology features to create a multi-parameter biosignature. First, we use the raw clinical and pathomics data to build a model multiscale biomarker network of aggressive skin melanoma. Using a Bayesian network, we identify nodes that determine the recurrence phenotype and identify new imaging and genomic targets that may enhance the precision of our biomarker. We then construct a composite biosignature based on this network. Finally, we test the new biosignature, as well as the original multiply validated biomarkers from Aim 1 in prospective retrospective fashion on samples from the E1697 trial of adjuvant interferon for which there is over 10 years of follow up. The retrospective prospective approach removes any selection bias introduced by retrospective study. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an urgent need to identify patients with stage II-III melanoma who have been cured by surgery, are not likely to recur, and should not receive further treatment. The immune system limits cancer progression but to date no biomarkers are available to define low risk groups. We further validate previously developed immune biomarkers and combine them to create a composite biosignature defining patients who can safely be spared the expense and toxicity of therapy.",Applying pathomics to establish a biosignature for aggressive skin melanoma.,10214049,R01CA260375,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Markers', 'British Columbia', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Roswell Park Cancer Institute', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Skin', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Universities', 'Update', 'base', 'biosignature', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'macrophage', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mortality risk', 'multi-scale modeling', 'nano-string', 'network models', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,693456
