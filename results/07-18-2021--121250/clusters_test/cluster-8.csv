"Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development Project Summary  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major congenital anomalies. In cases where CDH co-occurs with cardiovascular malformations (CVMs), mortality rates increase from 30 to 60%, and long-term morbidity is common. Our goal is to identify genes that cause CDH and CDH/CVM, and to discover the mechanism by which they control diaphragm and heart development.  Correctly identifying genes that contribute to specific phenotypes from the large list of candidate genes data generated in research and clinical studies is a major obstacle to progress in this and other research fields. In Specific Aim #1, we will address this challenge by generating ranked CDH and CDH/CVM pathogenicity scores for all RefSeq genes using a machine-learning algorithm that integrates data from large-scale genomic knowledge sources. We will use these scores to identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes from cytogenetically defined critical regions and form large next-generation sequencing databases as part of our multifaceted approach to novel gene discovery. We will also accelerate the pace at which human disease genes are discovered by making these scores and our machine-learning algorithm freely available.  8p23.1 microdeletions that encompass GATA4 and SOX7 are among the most frequently identified causes of CDH/CVM. In RNA-seq studies, we identified several CDH-associated genes that are dysregulated in the E15.5 diaphragms of Gata4flox/flox;Prx1-Cre embryos. These embryos are an ideal model of the sac hernias that comprise 20% of human CDH cases. In Specific Aim #2, we will combine data from RNA-seq and BioChIP-seq analyses with the priority scores generated in Aim #1 to identify primary GATA4 target genes whose dysregulation contribute to the development of sac CDH. We will then determine if alterations in the expression of these target genes can cause CDH, or can modify the CDH phenotypes of GATA4-deficient mice.  We have shown that SOX7 deficiency causes septal defects by decreasing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the developing heart. In RNA-seq and in situ hybridization studies we have shown that the expression of Wnt4—a key regulator of EMT in the endocardium—is severely decreased in E9.5 Sox7-/- hearts. In Specific Aim #3 we will determine if Wnt4 is a primary target of SOX7, and whether modulation of WNT4 or its downstream effectors can rescue SOX7-related cardiac phenotypes.  Several lines of evidence suggset that WNT4 is a novel CDH/CVM gene in humans. To confirm this association, and learn more about the role of WNT4 in diaphragm and heart development, we will determine if WNT4 deficiency causes CDH/CVM in mice, if Sox7 and Wnt4 interact genetically in the development of CDH/CVM and if SOX7 regulates Wnt4 transcripition in the developing diaphragm.  Through these studies we will identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes and pathways. The bioinformatic tools we develop in this grant will enhance gene discovery efforts across multiple research fields. Project Narrative Diaphragmatic hernias and cardiovascular malformations are serious birth defects. In this study, we will use bioinformatics and mouse models to identify genes that cause these birth defects and to learn how they work. These experiments will help us to understand how the diaphragm and heart form prior to birth and may ultimately lead to new ways of treating or preventing these birth defects.",Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development,10201699,R01HD098458,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Association Learning', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac development', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital diaphragmatic hernia', 'Cytogenetics', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diaphragmatic Hernia', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Encyclopedias', 'Endocardium', 'Endothelium', 'Foundations', 'GATA4 gene', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Hernia', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Luciferases', 'Mesenchymal', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Role', 'SOX7 gene', 'Source', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'WNT4 gene', 'Work', 'biochip', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cardiogenesis', 'congenital anomaly', 'data modeling', 'dosage', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'genome database', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malformation', 'microdeletion', 'molecular sequence database', 'mortality', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prevent', 'research study', 'septal defect', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web based interface']",NICHD,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,448377
"Determining the role of LSD1 in multiple myeloma through a multi-omics approach at single cell resolution PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) kills nearly 13,000 people annually in the United States1. MM is preceded by a less life- threating blood condition, which is similar to MM, yet non-lethal and asymptomatic2. in fact, most people don’t even know they have it. An outstanding question in MM research is why some patients diagnosed with the precursor condition go on to develop the full disease and why others do not. This question has been approached from a genetics standpoint, however there is no clear genetic link defining who goes on to develop MM from a precursor condition and who does not. Bone marrow creates a microenvironment to support developing blood cells. Multiple myeloma hijacks the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) to favor its own growth3. Without a genetic driver of cancer development, I hypothesize that the BMM is modified epigenetically to facilitate the selective growth of MM. Epigenetics encompasses that which influences the expression of genes without altering the genes themselves. Chromatin regulators (CRs) are proteins that mediate epigenetic changes through altering the ability of a cell to express a given gene. CRs carry out this process through modifying the histone proteins around which genes are wrapped (histones and DNA taken together comprise chromatin, hence: chromatin regulators). In addition to these very specific functions, CRs can also mediate interactions with transcription factors (TFs), the proteins that turn the expression levels of genes up or down. A specific CR LSD1, which is known to repress or turn off genes, has been the target of other blood cancer diseases and drugs designed to block LSD1 activity are quite effective in models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)45. These drugs work by disrupting an interaction between LSD1 and another protein. When that interaction is disrupted, a master TF is able to turn on genes that cause AML cells to die5. Despite some similarities between AML and MM, treatment with LSD1-targeting drugs actually enhances the growth of MM6. Interestingly, a small subset of patients have been found to be predisposed to MM development through a heritable set of mutations in LSD1 – these mutations mimic mutations that confer drug resistance in AML5,6. While these mutations only make up a small fraction of MM cases, it points to LSD1 as a key component in the development of MM7. I thereby hypothesize that LSD1 plays a role in the progression of MM; this role is potentially specific to the BMM. The specific aims of this project can be summarized as follows:  1. Develop a computational tool using novel techniques from machine learning and mathematics to learn  about factors that drive the BMM to contribute to the progression of MM.  2. Collect BMM samples from patients across a spectrum of MM development to analyze single cell gene  expression and chromatin accessibility data to learn the ways in which the epigenome is altered as MM  progresses in the BMM. PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple myeloma is a lethal cancer preceded by well-defined pre-myeloma conditions that are asymptomatic and non-lethal, though the transition between these precursor states and overt multiple myeloma is poorly understood. The bone marrow microenvironment is thought to be altered in patients that progress from pre- myeloma to overt multiple myeloma and a better understanding of this tissue’s involvement in disease development may highlight opportunities for therapeutic intervention prior to the development of overt multiple myeloma. This project aims to analyze single cells from the bone marrow microenvironment across a spectrum of patient disease development, as well as construct a novel computational architecture, to learn about the drivers of this oncogenic transformation.",Determining the role of LSD1 in multiple myeloma through a multi-omics approach at single cell resolution,10154128,F31CA257625,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heritability', 'Histones', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma Cells', 'Plasma Enhancement', 'Play', 'Precancerous Conditions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Supervision', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'acute myeloid leukemia cell', 'bone cell', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'disorder prevention', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'rate of change', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NCI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms. Novel mechanistic insights of diseases at the regulatory and molecular level will facilitate improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for human diseases.",Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular,10172932,R01GM131398,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,325001
"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,10130561,R35GM131845,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Caenorhabditis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth', 'Hermaphroditism', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Meiosis', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Switch Genes', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'X Inactivation', 'autosome', 'chromatin modification', 'condensin', 'dosage', 'histone demethylase', 'male', 'man', 'neural network', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'sex', 'sex determination', 'single molecule', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2021,466290
"Nuclear Organization and Function PROJECT SUMMARY. Proper regulation of gene expression is essential for cell differentiation and homeostasis. Most of our understanding of the mechanisms that control the transcription process comes from studies of the one-dimensional genome i.e. the 10 nm chromatin fiber. However, the genome is folded in the three-dimensional (3D) nuclear space, and the relationship between this organization and gene expression is poorly understood. Using Drosophila as a model system, where it is feasible to obtain 250 bp resolution Hi-C data, we have found that the genome is folded into only one type of domain, which we call compartmental domains. These domains precisely correlate with the transcriptional state of their sequences. Compartmental domains are also found in other lower eukaryotes. Based on this, we propose that compartmental domains represent an evolutionarily conserved principle of genome 3D organization. Drosophila and lower eukaryotes either lack CTCF or this protein is unable to stop cohesin extrusion. However, CTCF can interfere with the progression of cohesin extrusion in vertebrates, which in turn affects other types of interactions in the genome. Here we suggest extending concepts learned from the analysis of 3D organization in Drosophila to mammals by proposing an ambitious and substantive multi-disciplinary approach combining genetics, epigenomics, computational biology, and differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) into disease-relevant tissues. The hypothesis underlying the proposed experiments is based on the idea that, rather than the prevalent view of large compartments containing smaller TADs, the mammalian genome is organized by conserved principles into relatively small compartmental domains. Cohesin extrusion operates on top of the compartmental domain scaffold and affects its organization. To test this novel hypothesis, we will deplete specific proteins present in complexes required for various aspects of the transcription process. We will also deplete protein complexes responsible for H3K27me3- and H3K9me3-dependent silencing. We will then use Micro-C XL to obtain very high-resolution interaction data and examine effects of protein depletion on the formation of self-interacting domains and in the interactions between these domains. These effects will be examined in the presence and absence of cohesin in order to understand the contribution of loop extrusion to enhancer-promoter interaction frequency. We will examine the predictability of 3D genome organization from one-dimensional epigenetic information using machine learning computational tools. We will study the logic of CTCF loop formation by analyzing the local chromatin environment around CTCF sites able or unable to form loops of different strengths using a new computational tool we have developed. Principles learned from these experiments will be tested by analyzing changes in 3D organization and their relationship to gene expression during the differentiation of hESCs into pancreatic cells. Results from this work will fill critical gaps in our understanding of the relationship between 3D chromatin organization and transcription, and its possible role in human disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will analyze the mechanisms by which the three-dimensional organization of the genetic material in the nucleus is established and maintained. This organization is critical for the regulation of gene expression, and the results will be important to understand how transcription is controlled during stem cell differentiation or during reprograming of somatic cells. This knowledge will be essential to understand the basic biology of the cell nucleus and the origin of human genetic disease or cancer and could help guide the use of stem cell therapy to treat human diseases.",Nuclear Organization and Function,10083368,R35GM139408,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryota', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Hi-C', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Genetics', 'Knowledge', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Nuclear', 'Pancreas', 'Proteins', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Process', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mammalian genome', 'novel', 'promoter', 'protein complex', 'scaffold', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell therapy']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,431097
"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D This section has not changed since the submission of the parent U01 grant. Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. This section has not changed since the submission of the parent U01 grant. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",10241049,U01HG009395,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedias', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guide RNA', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Ploidies', 'Published Comment', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'sequence learning', 'supervised learning', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2021,742538
"Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development Rotator cuff tears affect over 15% of Americans and impair shoulder joint biomechanics and function. Following repair of symptomatic tears, functional deficits frequently persist and re-tears are common, due to the complex anatomy and high functional demands on the rotator cuff tendons. Rotator cuff tendon tissue engineering research is focused on devices to improve immediate mechanical support to the repair and to stimulate early and rapid tendon regeneration rather than scarring and fibrosis, particularly for the supraspinatus tendon (SST), the most commonly torn tendon in the rotator cuff. Aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic both the highly aligned medial region of the SST, and bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the multi-axially aligned isotropic anterior region of the SST have been evaluated with promising results when seeded with adipose- derived stem cells (ASCs). However, progress in this area of rotator cuff tendon engineering and in other areas of tendon research is hindered by the lack of definitive markers for SST or for its regional heterogeneity, the lack of understanding to what extent ASCs are tenogenic and can assume the identity of tendon fibroblasts, the lack of specific markers for tendon fibroblast identity and tenogenic differentiation, and by a lack of markers for tendon maturation and response to mechanical loading in engineered tendon. Therefore, is it difficult to assess how successful current tendon tissue engineering approaches really are, or to predict how well tendon tissue engineered approaches will function in translation when autologous or allogeneic ASCs from diverse human populations are used to enhance rotator cuff repair via augmentation or interposition with engineered tendon devices. These studies will evaluate the epigenome (methylome), transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, metabolome and phenome (phenotype) of native human SST and donor-matched tissue engineered tendon produced from SST fibroblasts and ASCs. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate the data to an integrated multiome, which will then be used with machine learning approaches to extract key causal ‘driver’ genes, or tendon specific genes or molecules responsible for: 1) SST heterogeneity between medial and anterior regions. 2) Tendon cell identity and the extent of tenogenesis by ASCs on electrospun scaffolds. 3) The heterogenetic response by ASCs on uni- vs. bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the native heterogeneity of the SST. 4) The response of engineered tendon to dynamic loading. Identified driver genes or molecules will be validated though over-expression or silencing approaches, thus providing therapeutic targets for manipulation to enhance tenogenesis, and engineered tendon development and maturation. Together these innovative studies will provide a template for improved external validity of benchtop tendon tissue engineering and pre-clinical studies towards successful translation in diverse patient populations. In addition, the bioinformatics and multiomics toolboxes and assays that result from this work will be invaluable to not only the tendon research community, but also to the wider musculoskeletal and regenerative medicine fields. A small number of driver genes in other medical fields are responsible for changes in expression and protein levels in hundreds of other genes, and subsequent tissue metabolism. The process of tissue engineered rotator cuff tendon development and formation as it relates to adult tendon after surgical repair is not well understood, despite rotator cuff tears being an important clinical problem and representing almost one third of orthopedic injuries. Evaluating changes in the ability of genes to be translated to proteins at the DNA, RNA, small metabolite, and protein level of tissue engineered tendon formation under different loading conditions compared to normal adult tendon will identify driver genes and potential new ways to improve currently available options for rotator cuff repair.",Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development,10098302,R01AR073882,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cadaver', 'Cells', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Harvest', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joint structure of shoulder region', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stimulation', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Seeds', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'design', 'epigenome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lipidome', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multiple omics', 'overexpression', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preclinical study', 'regenerative', 'repaired', 'response', 'rotator cuff tear', 'scaffold', 'spatial relationship', 'stem cells', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'tendon development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'translation to humans']",NIAMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,479770
"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs.

Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills.

"Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline Project Summary Despite extraordinary advances in genome engineering, tools for precise and efficient gene correction and delivery across all cell types remain lacking. Current programmable DNA cleavage tools, such as meganucleases, Zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR- Cas9, rely on recruiting the DNA repair machinery, either using error-prone, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair for gene knockout, or homology directed repair (HDR) for precise correction. However, HDR is inactive in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons, and is often inefficient, achieving 50% correction at most. Genome editing still lacks efficient, robust tools that can insert, delete, and recombine large stretches of DNA sequence. Moreover, delivery tools are a significant barrier to deploying tissue-specific genomic engineering technologies as current vehicles, including widely-used viral vectors and liposomal approaches, have limited capacity, offer variable efficiency, and lack precise tissue tropism. The proposed work involves computationally mining bacteria for new classes of gene editing enzymes and delivery vectors. We know that natural recombinases and transposases can mediate programmed DNA rearrangement and insertion, and these classes of enzymes are present in phage defense and mobile islands in bacteria, which largely remain uncharacterized. Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that retroviral/retrotransposon gag-like proteins can self-assemble and encapsulate nucleic acid in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and viral-like particles (VLPs) for cell-to-cell communication. As with defense islands, these proteins can also be systematically catalogued via a bioinformatic pipeline and experimentally characterized. The proposed work will focus on three main goals: 1) signatures for phage defense, mobile genetic activity, or VLP-forming activity will be mined to build a machine learning pipeline for comprehensively discovering novel gene clusters from novel metagenomic sequences with a focus for proteins that can manipulate nucleic acid or self-assemble, 2) candidate gene clusters will be cloned from metagenomic samples and undergo high-throughput screening using biochemical and bacterial assays for gene editing and capsid formation, as well as engineering to hone activity, and 3) the most promising candidates will be evaluated for activity in mammalian systems with assays for highly efficient gene insertion and VLP formation. The work will elucidate novel bacterial phage defense and VLP biology, and result in the development of new technologies for more efficient genetic manipulation and gene delivery. Moreover, this gene exploration and engineering framework will serve as a model for discovering diverse bacterial gene clusters and defense systems, evaluating biochemical activity across a range of assays, and converting these findings into high impact biotechnologies. The developed technologies will accelerate the pace of biomedical research and enable greater exploration of basic biological processes and disease mechanisms. Project Narrative There are more than 5,000 human diseases caused by known genetic variation, including mutations, insertions, and deletions, but programmable tools and delivery vectors to reliably study and model these diseases are lacking. We propose a two-pronged approach to discovering novel gene editing and delivery strategies by (1) mining bacterial and archaeal systems to identify novel defense systems and enzymes that have activities useful for genome editing and (2) identifying gene clusters linked to extracellular vesicle or viral-like particle formation that will allow development of better gene delivery systems. The technologies developed from this work will accelerate the study and modeling of disease biology and provide a framework for general prokaryotic gene discovery across many biotechnological areas.","Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline",10128377,R21AI149694,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacterial Model', 'Bacteriophages', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Capsid', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Elements', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Transfer', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Island', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liposomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Mining', 'Mitotic', 'Mobile Genetic Elements', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Nonhomologous DNA End Joining', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phylogeny', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stretching', 'Study models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Transposase', 'Viral', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'cell regeneration', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental adaptation', 'enzyme activity', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene delivery system', 'gene discovery', 'gene repair', 'genetic manipulation', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knockout gene', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein profiling', 'recombinase', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'restraint', 'screening', 'technology development', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'vector genome', 'zinc finger nuclease']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2021,225900
"Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology There is now incontrovertible evidence from sophisticated lineage tracing studies that vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) de-differentiation contributes substantively to a number of vascular diseases. A major manifesta- tion of such phenotypic change is attenuated expression of a battery of VSMC-restricted genes, including the enigmatic smooth muscle calponin (Cnn1) gene. The function of Cnn1 has been studied primarily in vitro or in a single knockout mouse wherein several exons and introns were replaced with a neo cassette which, as detailed below, obfuscates accurate interpretation of phenotypes. We have championed the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system in mice to engineer subtle substitutions within regulatory elements of many genes, leaving intact all coding sequences. We report here a remarkable phenotype wherein a single base change of a single CArG box in the Cnn1 locus abolishes expression of CNN1 in vascular (but not visceral) SMC. Full expression of CNN1 is restored with a BAC carrying human CNN1 or CRISPR-mediated activation of the en- dogenous Cnn1 promoter. Cnn1 CArG mutant mice, representing the first animal models of regulatory element edits, also show elevation in VSMC DNA synthesis and defective contractile competence. Conversely, over- expression of BAC-CNN1 suppresses VSMC growth, antagonizes neointimal formation, reduces VSMC lipid uptake, and enhances contractile gene expression. Interestingly, CNN1-Ser175 appears to be a critical residue for some of these effects making it an attractive amino acid for CRISPR-mediated editing in mice. Additional data support CNN1 as a scaffold for ERK signaling and effector of the immotile state of differentiated VSMC. Importantly, a complete understanding of CNN1 function is complicated by robust expression of two related genes (Cnn2 and Cnn3) in VSMC. We hypothesize that CNN1 functions in concert with other CNN isoforms to maintain a mature VSMC differentiated state. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims using state-of-the-art tools in genetics, animal models of disease, and molecular physiology assays of VSMC function. Aim 1 will exploit the single base edit in Cnn1 as a novel loss-of-function mouse in context of acute and chronic vascular disease models; complementation studies will be carried out in vitro and in vivo to rigorously ascribe pheno- typic changes to the specific loss of CNN1. Aim 2 will exploit a well-characterized BAC mouse to elucidate functions associated with Cnn1 gain-of-function in models of vascular disease used in Aim 1. Complementary CRISPR editing of the BAC mouse, in background of Cnn1 KO, will afford exquisite insight into functional residues that mediate CNN1 function. Aim 3 will exploit new floxed Cnn2 and Cnn3 mice with an exciting VSMC-specific Cre driver we have developed to address, for the first time, triple Cnn KO mouse models at baseline and in acute or chronic vascular disease models. These studies, based on paradigm-shifting approaches to gene KOs, serve as a template for the study of other gene families linked to VSMC differen- tiation and will inform future studies targeting CNN1 in diseases where VSMC differentiation is compromised. Diseases of blood vessels involve radical changes in the normal program of gene expression and function, the underlying nature of which is poorly understood. We have used the revolutionary CRISPR system of genome editing to study a gene called CNN1, which is specific for smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. We will study this gene, along with related genes, in both cells and blood vessels to gain new insights into vascular diseases.",Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology,10077575,R01HL136224,"['Actins', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Aneurysm', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Injury', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Cre driver', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth', 'Hematological Disease', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Introns', 'Ion Channel', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'LoxP-flanked allele', 'MAPK3 gene', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Serum Response Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'base', 'calponin', 'cell growth', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'gene function', 'genome editing', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'insight', 'knockout gene', 'loss of function', 'migration', 'mouse genetics', 'mouse model', 'myocardin', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'response', 'scaffold', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vascular injury', 'vascular smooth muscle cell migration']",NHLBI,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,560412
"Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to build mathematical models of human innate immune responses to the global pathogen influenza virus A (IAV). To ensure successful replication, viral pathogens must simultaneously hijack several components of the host cell machinery while either evading or disabling innate cellular defenses. The host genetic background and subsequent viral and host signaling interactions dictate disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to mortality. Recent studies of IAV in genetically diverse murine models confirm the critical role of genotype in host response and outcome. Both molecular targets as well as key proteins involved in IAV pathogenesis could be therapeutically exploited to attenuate or prevent disease. Thus, we construct models of the molecular networks driving early innate IAV response that can be used to model genetic effects. Our experimental system is human lung epithelium, the first-line of defense against and target of IAV.  Aim 1. Genetic predictions from the gene regulatory network (GRN) governing human epithelial IAV response. GRNs describe the control of gene expression by transcription factors (TFs). We showed that integrating ATAC-seq with RNA-seq improves GRN accuracy. To construct a dynamic GRN in our heterogeneous lung tissue model, we propose scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements of IAV infection and IFNβ stimulation time courses. Our group recently discovered new mechanisms by which the IAV protein Ns1 drives promoter-independent transcriptional “read-through” and alters 3D-chromatin architecture. Thus, for modeling, we also measure genomic transcription initiation and promoter-capture Hi-C. Following experimental testing and GRN refinement, we will use a deep-learning model trained on DNA sequence and epigenetic data to provide inputs that enable dynamic GRN simulations for thousands of human genotypes. We will identify genetic risk loci and molecular mechanisms driving difference in gene expression responses across individuals.  Aim 2. Model the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and cellular signaling networks driving the innate immune response to IAV. We developed mutant influenza viruses, each encoding a FLAG-tagged viral protein, while maintaining virulence in vivo. We will use the mutant IAV to map host-virus PPIs in human lung epithelial cells and mouse lung in vivo. Integrating with diverse ‘omics datasets, we will construct a molecular network model connecting virus-host PPIs through cellular signaling pathways to IAV-dependent TFs. We will test pathway reconstruction with epistasis mapping.  Completion of both aims will lead to a GRN spanning virus-host PPIs and cellular signaling to TF control of gene expression in an innate-immune cell type. Our experimental-computational design is widely applicable. This model, and its future adaptation to other cells, will help identify the genetic and molecular mechanisms driving diverse human IAV responses and the network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Human response to Influenza virus infection varies dramatically between individuals, from mildly symptomatic to death. We will systematically measure and model the innate immune response to IAV at the molecular network level: from host-virus protein-protein interactions through cellular signal transduction to changes in gene expression in human cells. The resulting mathematical model will help identify network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy and help predict differences in IAV response in the human population.",Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus,10240457,U01AI150748,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromatin', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hi-C', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza A virus', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferon-beta', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Population', 'Prize', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tracheal Epithelium', 'Training', 'Transcription Elongation', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'adaptive immune response', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu', 'forest', 'global health', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human model', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenza infection', 'influenzavirus', 'mathematical model', 'molecular modeling', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'risk variant', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF', 'transcription termination', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2021,1221095
"Hit-and-Run transcription: The impact of transient interactions in dynamic gene regulatory networks that mediate rapid nutrient signaling Project Summary: This grant exploits TIME - the 4th and largely unexplored dimension of transcription - to capture transient interactions in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that are important, but missed, in vivo. This is because genome- scale methods to capture transcription factor (TF) target interactions favor stable binding, and reporter gene studies which detect transient TF-target interactions in seconds, miss global responses needed for GRN models. We aim to fill the time-gap in our collective knowledge of dynamic GRNs by experimentally capturing transient TF-target interactions globally using a cell-based temporal TF perturbation assay (Aims 1 & 2), and evaluate their importance in forecasting gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3), a main goal of systems biology. We model temporal GRNs controlling nitrogen (N)-signaling in plants, but our approaches are broadly applicable. We exploit a cell-based assay for temporal TF perturbation, TARGET, which captures transient TF-target interactions genome-wide; i) by TF-mediated gene regulation even in the absence of detectable TF-binding, ii) within minutes of controlled TF nuclear entry, and iii) identifies highly transient TF-binding leading to sustained transcription by affinity-capture of de novo mRNAs. We discovered that i) a single TF can stably or transiently bind to, and induce or repress, distinct sets of targets depending on their cis-context, ii) that transient TF-targets captured only in cells control early N-responses in planta, for two master TFs in our GRNs (bZIP1 & NLP7). This genome-wide data supports a Hit-and-Run transcription model, where a TF Hit can initiate a stable transcriptional complex, including recruitment of TF partners, enabling transcription to continue after the initiating TF is no longer bound, the Run. This could allow a small number of TF molecules to rapidly affect a large number of target genes by acting catalytically. Our studies have been cited and influenced thinking of transient transcription mechanisms across yeast, stems cells, and were invoked to explain the new discovery of transient binding of Zelda/Bicoid to a reporter gene in Drosophila. Herein, we deploy experimental and computational innovations to test the pervasiveness and in vivo significance of a conceptual innovation - transient Hit-and- Run interactions in GRNs. Our experimental innovations include; i) Assays for Hit-and-Run activity across all 70 TF families in Arabidopsis, using a higher throughput version of the cell-based TARGET assay we recently published, ii) new methods to capture TF-target interactions using time-series biotin-ChIP and DamID, which leaves DNA methylation marks on transient TF-target interactions, supported by preliminary data (Aims 1 & 2). Our computational innovations include: i) ConnectTF, a platform to integrate TF-DNA binding and RNA-seq data and identify candidate Hit-and-Run TFs, and approaches to assess the in planta relevance of transient TF- target interactions in GRNs, such as ii) our newly published Network Walking method, and iii) OutPredict, a new time-based method to forecast gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3). Our experimental & computational approaches are broadly applicable and our results are relevant to environmental N-use affecting human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This work illustrates a combined experimental and computational approach to discover gene regulatory networks in a pathway, process, or trait - applied across a range of problems in biology, agriculture and medicine.

"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,10224662,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2021,480000
"Profiling the Functional Genetics of Health and Disease using BrainGENIE: The Brain Gene Expression and Network Imputation Engine Abstract The pathophysiology of brain disorders remains unknown because we cannot study the relevant tissue in living human subjects. Postmortem brain tissue is useful, but expensive, rare, and critically confounded by antemortem and agonal factors. These two facts have inspired the search for alternative strategies, such as the use of surrogate markers like blood-based gene expression. To improve the rigor of this widely used approach, we developed a novel computational method called the Brain Gene Expression and Network Imputation Engine (BrainGENIE) that leverages biological comparability between blood and brain gene expression to predict transcriptome profiles for brain tissue based on blood gene-expression profiles. BrainGENIE is fundamentally different from other transcriptome-imputation methods, and captures a much larger proportion of the variance in—and larger fraction of—the brain transcriptome. BrainGENIE is capable of predicting approximately 9–57% of the brain transcriptome, which yields an approximate 1.8-fold increase in coverage relative to the “gold standard” method PrediXcan, and which greatly improves our statistical power to detect genes and pathways associated with disease. Our proposal contains three Specific Aims to improve our method and shed light on biological pathways underlying neuropsychiatric disorders. Aim 1: Refine BrainGENIE to capture additional genes that are not currently well predicted by our method. Aim 2: Apply BrainGENIE to our collection of publicly available and in-house data to predict brain-region-specific gene expression profiles for over 8,000 living persons, and discover region-specific gene-expression patterns associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Aim 3: Disseminate BrainGENIE as stand-alone software for other researchers to use freely. Guided by recent genetic and genomic studies, we hypothesize that comparable patterns of gene dysregulation will be found across neuropsychiatric disorders among pathways involving innate immunity, chromatin remodeling, neurodevelopment, and neurotransmission. Inclusion of neurodegenerative disorders in our analysis will allow us to determine whether gene expression patterns are shared across a broader range of brain disorders. We also expect to identify disorder-specific and brain-region-specific transcriptomic associations. Our project will enable new lines of inquiry into biological changes that emerge in the brains of living persons, and create opportunities to improve diagnostics, intervention, and treatment. Project Narrative There is a critical need for a method that would allow us to safely study the living human brain so that we can answer centuries-old questions about mental illness, and accelerate progress to improve diagnostics, treatments, and interventions. To accomplish this, we developed a new prediction tool called BrainGENIE that uses correlations between blood and brain tissue to allow us to approximate gene expression levels in the living human brain, and identify molecular mechanisms underlying mental illness. We propose to apply our method to generate brain- region-specific gene expression profiles in over 8,000 individuals (the largest dataset of its kind) and discover genes and biological pathways associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, which will deepen our understanding of pathophysiology.",Profiling the Functional Genetics of Health and Disease using BrainGENIE: The Brain Gene Expression and Network Imputation Engine,10235574,R21MH126494,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Attention', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Immunity', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'gene discovery', 'genome wide association study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'public repository', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,243000
"REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  PROJECT SUMMARY  DNA motifs bind transcription factors (TFs) that control gene expression in normal and diseased skin. AR45192 recently mapped the enhancers and promoters that are sequentially activated during epidermal differentiation, and found them enriched for 15 conserved DNA motif combinations, or DNA motif “grammars”. This suggested that these grammars, acting through recruitment of motif-binding TFs, may encode the DNA sequence logic that coordinates the temporal and spatial induction of early and late epidermal differentiation genes. AR45192 also found that these grammars were recurrently altered by single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs, for “expression SNPs”) linked by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to skin diseases characterized by disrupted epidermal differentiation, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This suggests that newly identified DNA motif grammars may control differentiation and that their disruption may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  Aim I will test the hypothesis that specific DNA motif grammars control the physiologic activation of differentiation genes necessary for normal epidermal function. First, it will define the temporal activity of hundreds of examples of each grammar in early and late differentiation within intact epidermis. Second, it will quantitate epidermal differentiation gene expression and barrier function in isogenic epidermal tissues in which a subset of grammars have been altered by gene-editing. Aim I is designed to characterize the actions of newly identified DNA motif grammars in epidermal differentiation.  Aim II will test the hypothesis that SCC risk eSNPs residing within epidermal differentiation motif grammars alter gene expression in a way that enhances cancer progression. First, it will define SCC eSNP impacts on gene expression in normal epidermis with a goal to understanding the altered target genes, and their biologic functions, that predispose to SCC risk. Second, it will quantitatively assess the impact of these SCC risk eSNPs, singly and in combination, on neoplastic progression of epidermal neoplasia in vivo. Aim II is designed to define the impact of regulatory DNA variants on epidermal gene expression and disease progression.  This AR45192 competing renewal will characterize the role of newly identified regulatory DNA grammars in epidermal homeostasis and neoplastic progression. RELEVANCE  Abnormal differentiation is a hallmark of common skin diseases, such as epidermal cancers, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and certain ichthyoses. Transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA motifs in enhancers to control differentiation gene expression in skin and other tissues. Characterizing the patterns of normal and disease-linked DNA sequence motifs that control epidermal differentiation may be of broad utility in the future treatment and prevention of skin disorders. REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  Project Narrative The control of gene expression determines the health or disease of human tissues, including skin. Systematic definition of the regulatory DNA motif combinations in homeostasis and early cancer progression is designed to provide information to advance human health for skin and other tissues. 1",REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION,10107766,R01AR045192,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dependovirus', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Future', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Ichthyoses', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-in', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Reporter', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'design', 'gene induction', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'keratinocyte differentiation', 'neural network algorithm', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'skin barrier', 'skin disorder', 'skin squamous cell carcinoma', 'transcription factor', 'tumor progression']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,459691
"Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation Project Summary/Abstract: With the surge of large genomics data, there is an immense increase in the breadth and depth of different omics datasets and an increasing importance in the topic of privacy of individuals in genomic data science. Detailed genetic and environmental characterization of diseases and conditions relies on the large-scale mining of functional genomics data; hence, there is great desire to share data as broadly as possible. However, there is a scarcity of privacy studies focused on such data. A key first step in reducing private information leakage is to measure the amount of information leakage in functional genomics data, particularly in different data file types. To this end, we propose to to derive information-theoretic measures for private information leakage in different data types from functional genomics data. We will also develop various file formats to reduce this leakage during sharing. We will approach the privacy analysis under three aims. First, we will develop statistical metrics that can be used to quantify the sensitive information leakage from raw reads. We will systematically analyze how linking attacks can be instantiated using various genotyping methods such as single nucleotide variant and structural variant calling from raw reads, signal profiles, Hi-C interaction matrices, and gene expression matrices. Second, we will study different algorithms to implement privacy-preserving transformations to the functional genomics data in various forms. Particularly, we will create privacy-preserving file formats for raw sequence alignment maps, signal track files, three-dimensional interaction matrices, and gene expression quantification matrices that contain information from multiple individuals. This will allow us to study the sources of sensitive information leakages other than raw reads, for example signal profiles, splicing and isoform transcription, and abnormal three-dimensional genomic interactions. Third, we will investigate the reads that can be mapped to the microbiome in the raw human functional genomics datasets. We will use inferred microbial information to characterize private information about individuals, and then combine the microbial information with the information from human mapped reads to increase the re-identification accuracy in the linking attacks described in the second aim. We will use the tools to quantify the sensitive information and privacy-preserving file formats in the available datasets from large sequencing projects, such as the ENCODE, The Cancer Genome Atlas, 1,000 Genomes, gEUVADIS, and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. Project Narrative: Sharing large-scale functional genomics data is critical for scientific discovery, but comes with important privacy concerns related to the possible misuse of such data. This proposal will quantify and manage the rieslkasted to releasing functional genomics datasets, based on integrating inferred genotypes from the raw sequence files, signal tracks, and microbiome mapped sequences. Finally, we will develop file formats, statistical methodologies, and related software for anonymization of functional genomics data that enable open sharing.",Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation,10251876,R01HG010749,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Glean', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoker', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'human tissue', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'open data', 'privacy preservation', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,526482
"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biologicalpathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of

"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,10085663,R01HG009309,"['Archives', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase I', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,387500
"Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development Abstract Craniofacial abnormalities are some of the most commonly occurring human birth defects worldwide, with up to 200,000 children born every year with some type of craniofacial defect. These defects can occur as part of complex syndromes that involve multiple tissues and organs. The syndromic forms of these disorders have been successfully linked to nearly 500 genes including TWIST1 for craniosynostosis and IRF6 for orofacial clefting. However more frequently no other part of the body is directly involved (50% of craniosynostoses, 70% of orofacial clefts). Genome wide association studies indicate heritability for such defects, however the vast majority of associations fall outside of genes suggesting defective gene regulation is a major contributor to incidence of such defects. Gene regulatory elements can be located throughout the genome and typically have tissue-specific activity, making them difficult to identify and predict what gene they control. The overall objective of this application is to integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets from early human and mouse craniofacial development from our lab as well as FaceBase to comprehensively predict regulatory element-gene interactions. Our hypothesis posits that conserved regulatory networks between human and mouse are enriched for disease relevant biology. In Aim 1 we propose to systematically identify chromatin states in human from 4.5 to 8 weeks of gestation and in mouse from embryonic days 9.5 to 15.5. In Aim 2 we propose to identify genes that are coordinately regulated in both species across these developmental windows. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to integrate these two disparate network types to identify regulatory element-gene pairings. We will experimentally validate predicted interactions in a culture model of cranial neural crest cells using proximity-ligation coupled with immunoprecipitation. Our proposed studies will generate the most comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptomic networks in a developing human tissue and for the first time identify the conserved regulatory architecture for building the mammalian orofacial complex. Defects in embryonic patterning resulting in clefts of orofacial tissue are common birth defects affecting more than 1 in 1000 live births. The genetic causes of these defects have been difficult to determine, but all current evidence suggests defective gene regulation during embryonic development underlies these birth defects. This project seeks to identify regulatory networks that control gene expression during craniofacial development and are conserved between human and mouse.",Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development,10083207,R03DE028588,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Body part', 'Cephalic', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coupled', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Neural Crest Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Syndrome', 'TWIST1 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computational pipelines', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'differential expression', 'embryo tissue', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'falls', 'gene interaction', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'human tissue', 'multiple omics', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'programs', 'promoter', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R03,2021,164000
"Optical Tools to Assess the Role of Cardiac Function in the Development of Congenital Heart Defects Project Summary We and others have shown that altered hemodynamics and shear stress can lead to congenital heart defects (CHDs), but still there is limited information on how these forces affect molecular signaling. Studying the impact of abnormal hemodynamics and shear stress becomes even more urgent when we consider that perturbed blood flow may be a contributing factor to a large percentage of CHDs regardless of whether the initial trigger is environmental or genetic. Although our group and others have recently developed extremely useful optical imaging tools (e.g., optical coherence tomography – OCT) to assess hemodynamics and shear stress, and connected these measurements to CHDs, it has been difficult to link shear stress with the affected molecular pathways. Our group and others have performed qPCR experiments on control and shear-stress perturbed hearts to see how abnormal hemodynamics alters gene expression. However, this approach requires the entire embryonic heart for one measurement, missing all spatial and cell-type information, particularly at the endocardial layer. In order to successfully assess how shear stress affects molecular signaling throughout the looping heart, we need to improve upon our OCT methods, develop 3D methods for assessing embryonic heart gene expression, and create an advanced image processing pipeline to analyze data and relate regional shear stress to gene expression.  This renewal proposal will continue our work developing tools that can lead to a more sophisticated understanding of how cardiac function (e.g., hemodynamics and electrical impulse conduction) affects heart development, enabling potential therapies to avoid or mitigate CHDs. In this proposal, we will focus on developing tools to understand how oscillatory shear stress (quantified as oscillatory shear index - OSI) influences gene expression and leads to CHDs. In our preliminary studies, we increased regurgitant blood flow (causing increased OSI) to show that alterations to OSI leads to smaller cardiac cushions (valve precursors) and ultimately, to CHDs. Increased regurgitant blood flow and smaller cushions is present in our two disease models (fetal alcohol spectrum disorders – FASD; velo-cardio-facial syndrome/Digeorge) and our FASD prevention compounds partially normalize blood flow, cardiac cushion size, and greatly reduce morbidity and CHDs.  Our specific aims include 1) advance our OCT system and shear stress analysis, 2) develop fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) protocols to measure gene expression in 3D, 3) develop an image processing pipeline to relate gene expression to shear stress, and 4) determine the impact of shear stress on gene expression. Upon completion, we will have significantly more information on how shear stress affects molecular expression. With this knowledge, we will be better equipped to determine which molecular pathways are most influenced by altered hemodynamics, to develop earlier detection methods and potentially develop strategies to prevent CHDs more effectively. Project Narrative Abnormal blood flow has been shown to play a role in the formation of congenital heart defects (CHDs). However, few tools exist to study how forces exerted by blood flow early in heart development result in altered molecular signaling. Our proposal centers on creating optical imaging to investigate mechanical stresses experienced by cells lining the beating, early-stage heart tube and how these cells and adjacent tissues respond in gene expression in each area of the heart during normal, diseased, and rescued conditions.",Optical Tools to Assess the Role of Cardiac Function in the Development of Congenital Heart Defects,10211096,R01HL126747,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Betaine', 'Biological Process', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Heart', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Glutathione', 'Heart', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quail', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sequencing By Hybridizations', 'Shprintzen syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tube', 'Work', 'addiction', 'cardiogenesis', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'detection method', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'hemodynamics', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'indexing', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,767418
"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,10208923,R01HG010045,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'comparative', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genomic locus', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'markov model', 'multi-task learning', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'novel', 'promoter', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,332892
"Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches Aortic valve stenosis is the major cause of valve disease in the Western world, and the third leading cause of adult heart disease. It is a progressive disorder that worsens with age. Thickening of the aortic valve is followed by calcification that results in further stenosis that ultimately necessitates surgical replacement. A major risk factor for calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), which is present in 1–2% of the population, and involves formation of a two- rather than three-valve leaflet. ~35% of individuals with BAV will develop CAVD with age, but some with BAV have thickening even in childhood, requiring intervention. There are no medical treatments available for CAVD patients, and the only clinical option is surgical valve replacement. We reported that heterozygous nonsense mutations in the NOTCH1 (N1) transcription factor cause congenital biscuspid aortic valve (BAV) and severe CAVD and evidence suggests N1 is haploinsufficient in valve endothelial cells (ECs). Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs from several patients with CAVD and N1 haploinsufficiency showed increased expression of pro-osteogenic and inflammatory signaling. Network analysis revealed key nodes that were responsible for much of the gene dysregulation. A chemical screen for the ability to restore expression of 120 dysregulated genes by targeted RNA-sequencing revealed several drugs that restored the network close to the N1+/+ state in human iPSC-ECs, with one, XCT790, showing efficacy in vivo for aortic valve thickening, calcification and stenosis in a mouse model. XCT790 is annotated to function as an inhibitor of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα). We now propose to test the hypotheses that XCT790 prevents aortic valve disease by inhibiting ERRα activity, can treat established disease, and can function in a subset of CAVD patient cells without N1 mutations. The aims are 1) to determine the mechanism of action by which XCT790 corrects disease-associated gene expression and prevents aortic valve disease; 2) to determine if XCT790 can treat established CAVD or prevent neonatal valve stenosis; and 3) to determine if gene dysregulation in primary aortic valve endothelial cells from sporadic CAVD patients with or without genetic variants in NOTCH1 pathway genes is responsive to XCT790. These studies will advance a potential therapeutic to treat a disease that represents an enormous unmet medical need, is characterized by high mortality and morbidity, and for which the only current remedy is a highly invasive surgery. Aortic valve disease is the third most common form of heart disease and one of the most difficult to treat pediatric diseases. In adults, calcification and thickening lead to need for surgical replacement, with no medical therapy available. In this proposal we test the mechanism by which a novel small molecule therapeutic prevents aortic valve calcification in mice, test the clinical scenarios in which it may be efficacious and determine the range of patients who may benefit from this therapy by examining the response of cells derived from individuals with valve disease.",Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches,10103847,R01HL150100,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'ERR1 protein', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Estrogen Antagonists', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NOTCH1 gene', 'Neonatal', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Pulmonary Valve Stenosis', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Surgical Valves', 'Telomerase RNA Component', 'Telomere Shortening', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Western World', 'aging population', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve disorder', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'calcification', 'cell type', 'drug testing', 'endothelial stem cell', 'exome sequencing', 'gene correction', 'genetic variant', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'malformation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'osteogenic', 'prevent', 'response', 'shear stress', 'small molecule libraries', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'telomere', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'valve replacement']",NHLBI,J.

"Genetic regulation of atrial gene expression in development and disease SUMMARY  Precise regulation of atrial gene expression is crucial to maintain atrial homeostasis, and disorders or gene mutations that impact atrial gene expression can cause atrial fibrillation (AF), a serious arrhythmia that affects an estimated 33 million people worldwide. However, there remain many gaps in our understanding of atrial gene regulation, including the mechanisms that underlie chamber-selective gene expression. Human genetic studies have shown that sequence variants near the cardiac transcription factor gene TBX5 are associated with greater AF risk, and mice with Tbx5 deficiency develop AF. Although recent work has identified some TBX5-regulated genes that contribute to AF susceptibility, the atrial TBX5-centered transcriptional network is incompletely explored. Elucidation of this network and its sensitivity to TBX5 dose would reveal nodal points in AF pathogenesis and may suggest new approaches to prevent or treat AF. The overarching goal of this re- search proposal is to elucidate the atrial gene regulatory network and how it is perturbed in AF. The proposal buillds on novel reagents and techniques developed in the Pu lab to interrogate transcriptional mechanisms in vivo, including highly sensitive and reproducible cardiac transcription factor ChIP-seq through in vivo biotinyla- tion (bioChIP-seq), massively parallel in vivo measurement of cis-regulatory element (CRE) activity (AAV- MPRA assay), and mosaic gene inactivation strategies to hone in direct, cell autonomous effects of gene inac- tivation. In Aim 1, we use bioChIP-seq and AAV-MPRA to define atrial CREs and to dissect the sequence fea- tures required for their chamber selective activity. In Aim 2, we determine the effect of TBX5 deficiency on the occupancy of other TFs and p300, the activity of CREs, and the expression of atrial genes. We use these data to define the TBX5-centered atrial gene regulatory network, and to determine how this network is perturbed by TBX5 haploinsufficiency or knockout. In Aim 3, we test the hypothesis, suggested by our preliminary data, that TBX5 regulates atrial genes through functional and physical interaction with TEAD1. Successful completion of this proposal will lead to new insights into atrial gene regulation and its perturbation in AF. NARRATIVE  The heart's upper chambers, the atria, and its lower chambers, the ventricles, contain fundamentally dis- tinct types of muscle cells, and are affected by different types of disease. One common and severe disease specific to the atria is atrial fibrillation, which occurs in over 9% of older individuals. This proposal will investi- gate the mechanisms that maintain atrial muscle cell gene expression, and perturbation of these mechanisms that cause atrial fibrillation, resulting in new insights into the causes of atrial diseases such as atrial fibrillation.",Genetic regulation of atrial gene expression in development and disease,10138240,R01HL156503,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Age-Years', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotinylation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Data', 'Dependovirus', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Dose', 'EP300 gene', 'Enhancers', 'Etiology', 'GATA4 gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Transduction Agent', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Metabolic stress', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mus', 'Muscle Cells', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nodal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Precipitation', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'biochip', 'combinatorial', 'dosage', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'heart function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'muscle enhancer factor-2A', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'organ growth', 'prevent', 'programs', 'stem', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,607338
"Exploiting convergent evolution to design biomarker extraction tools for the prediction of therapeutic response in cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The effective treatment of drug resistant tumors represents one of the greatest unmet needs in oncology research. The evolution of therapeutic resistance in cancer is a dynamic process, shaped by many external forces, including selection pressures, microenvironment, and the timescales of clinical treatments. As tumors evolve under these heterogeneous settings, a variety of genotypes emerge and lead to large differences in drug response phenotypes between patients. By grouping tumors based on their response to treatment, we can exploit principles of convergent evolution, where similar phenotypes evolve independently between individuals. In doing so, this work aims to aid precision medicine by identifying commonalities between tumors with similar drug response phenotypes.  Gene expression signatures are a powerful tool that can be used to predict convergent states of drug sensitiv- ity and resistance. Using vast open-source datasets, Aim 1 of this proposal will demonstrate a novel method for extracting and validating gene expression signatures to predict therapeutic response in cancer. Cell lines with the best and worst response to a given drug are pooled and compared using differential gene expression analysis. Genes with increased expression in a state of sensitivity or resistance become seed genes in a co-expression network based on gene expression from tumor samples. From there, only seed genes with strong co-expression within patient samples are extracted to form the ﬁnal gene expression signature. This novel approach integrates clinical sample data to the signature extraction method in order to increase translational value compared to molec- ular signatures extracted using only cell line datasets. Next, Aim 2 of this proposal investigates the phenomenon of collateral sensitivity, where resistance to one drug aligns with sensitivity to another drug. Because the evo- lution of collateral resistance and sensitivity can be unpredictable, molecular signatures of convergent states of collateral sensitivity and resistance could greatly enhance treatment planning once resistance to ﬁrst-line ther- apy has evolved. Using EGFR+ non-small cell lung cancer cell lines as a model system, this project aims to identify molecular signatures of evolutionarily convergent collateral sensitivity/resistance phenotypes during the experimental evolution of therapeutic resistance to targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tumor differences between patients can hinder the prediction of therapeutic response in cancer, as patients with seemingly similar tumors often display varying levels of chemo-sensitivity or -resistance. This work aims to abandon the “one-drug-ﬁts-all” approach and produce a novel method for discovering biomarkers of therapeutic sensitivity and resistance in cancer. Our results will assist clinicians in choosing the best available treatment for each individual patient.",Exploiting convergent evolution to design biomarker extraction tools for the prediction of therapeutic response in cancer,10138410,F30CA257076,"['Ally', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evolution', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Imatinib', 'Individual', 'Inter-tumoral heterogeneity', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Work', 'base', 'bcr-abl Fusion Proteins', 'cancer cell', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'gene product', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage Project Summary / Abstract In the hours after learning, the activation of gene expression follows a specific pattern, producing transient waves of expression needed for long-term memory consolidation. These changes require non-genetic (i.e., “epigenetic”) events, including modifications to: DNA-organizing proteins known as histones, the DNA itself, and the accessibility of DNA to proteins. Additionally, the molecular changes necessary for memory require a form of RNA-based regulation. In the absence of such changes, the long-lasting regulation of gene expression during memory storage fails, and this could account for defects in memory that accompany many psychiatric disorders. Our long-term goal is to define novel epigenetic mechanisms underlying memory storage and synaptic plasticity by taking advantage of recent advances in our understanding of histone modifications, in the development of single-cell RNA technology, and in the function of regulatory mechanisms mediated by small noncoding RNAs. During the previous funding period, we defined a novel metabolic source of acetyl-CoA in the nucleus and have obtained preliminary data about new forms of histone acylation and crotonylation associated with spatial learning. We also developed bioinformatic tools to analyze single nuclear RNA sequencing data to identify neurons activated by learning. We further established the reversal of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated mRNA silencing as a novel epigenetic means of regulating activity-dependent translation, linking synaptic activity to translational upregulation of key memory-related targets. These major findings provide the basis of our proposed experiments that we believe will define the next frontiers in our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms of memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the impact of a novel histone modification, histone crotonylation, on the epigenetic landscape and gene expression during memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 2, we will define cell type-specific transcriptional signatures of the hippocampal neurons during memory consolidation and retrieval. In Specific Aim 3, we will elucidate the microRNA- dependent mechanisms that regulate long-term memory and synaptic plasticity driven by a microRNA processing complex. An understanding of these key epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved in the consolidation and storage of long-term memories is expected to ultimately lead to the development of new treatments for the debilitating cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Project Narrative The regulation of specific genes critical to the storage of memories (“memory consolidation”) and changes in neuronal function (“plasticity”) vital for learning are controlled by a number of mechanisms that are not themselves regulated by genetics. We propose to determine the functional roles of such epigenetic processes in memory consolidation and plasticity, and to define the sets of genes that are activated, in individual cells, during memory consolidation. This research promises to provide information that will be critical to the development of novel therapeutics capable of alleviating the cognitive deficits underlying many psychiatric disorders.",Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage,10211384,R01MH087463,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Acetylation', 'Acyl Coenzyme A', 'Acylation', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Coenzyme A', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Histones', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear RNA', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Ribonucleases', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Derepression', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translational Repression', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'long term memory', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,740506
"Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals ABSTRACT While multidrug-resistance transporters including P-gp and MRP2 are generally studied for their role in exporting drugs and foreign compounds from the cell, our studies indicate that these efflux pumps expressed at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells provide a critical link in communication between sentinel functions of mucosal barriers and the immune system. Understanding how this P-gp/eCB anti-inflammatory arm is regulated will provide crucial insight into how dysfunction may promote intestinal inflammation and help identify potential new therapeutic targets. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the central hypothesis we aim to test is whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to prevent unnecessary inflammation. Our pilot studies indicate that the microbiota does influence P-gp expression and function, providing a unique foundation for further cause-effect studies. No data have previously demonstrated a link between the microbiota and eCBs or any other epithelial lipid signals, and may well provide great insight into a novel system. Bridging this gap could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To begin addressing these questions, in Aim 1 of this application will combine in vitro (including human colonoids) and in vivo murine model systems, as well as use healthy and UC patient stool, to more deeply understand the microbial consortia that collectively maximize P-gp expression and function. Aim 2 is designed to identify the microbial metabolites that drive activation of P-gp expression and eCB secretion to maintain an anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Thus, transcriptomics and metabolite analyses will be performed to provide new information regarding microbial genes, gene clusters, and their metabolic products implicated in maintaining an anti- inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium through regulation of the P-gp/eCB axis. In Aim 3 we will employ novel computational methods will to uncover the inter-microbial network responses and the ecological structure of a stable community that is able to induce P-gp expression. Collectively, knowledge of the pathways that coordinate the maintenance of the P-gp/eCB axis will require a comprehensive understanding of distinct signals regulating intestinal homeostasis, how multiple signals are integrated in the complex intestinal environment, and pathways that modulate host-microbe interactions. Consequently, this proposal will directly advance novel biological principles with guidance of new therapeutic intervention strategies. Public Health Narrative Regulated recruitment and migration of acute inflammatory cells termed neutrophils (PMN) into the intestine and across the specialized epithelium that lines it is critical for host defense, yet dysregulation of this process is associated with disease. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the goal of this proposal will examine whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to maintain a homeostatic anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Understanding this process could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals,10212384,R01DK125407,"['ABCB1 gene', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Apical', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Colitis', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethanolamines', 'Eubacterium', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Intestines', 'Invaded', 'Knowledge', 'Lactobacillus', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Submucosa', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Work', 'Xenobiotic Metabolism', 'arm', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'commensal bacteria', 'design', 'efflux pump', 'first responder', 'healing', 'host colonization', 'host-microbe interactions', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innate immune mechanisms', 'insight', 'intestinal epithelium', 'intestinal homeostasis', 'mathematical model', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'normal microbiota', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'nuclear factor 1', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'theories', 'transcriptomics']",NIDDK,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,560048
"Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis Despite major advances in prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it remains a major cause of deaths worldwide. As ASCVD is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and impact on this unmet residual risk. One such human polymorphism in the ID3 gene (rs11574) was associated with ASCVD in 3 distinct human cohorts. Notably, this SNP significantly attenuates ID3 function and studies in pre-clinical models confirm a critical role for ID3 in atheroprotection. We have previously shown that loss of ID3 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and promotes VSMC expression of inflammatory factors, processes linked to increase atherosclerosis. In collaboration with Dr. Gary Owens, we have generated a mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and VSMC-specific deletion of ID3 to study ID3-dependent VSMC specific changes during the course of lesion development in the context of the whole animal. We have developed a comprehensive CyTOF panel to identify and quantitate key cellular and intracellular changes in VSMC and other lesional cells in the aorta during the course of atherosclerosis development in these mice. To translate murine findings to humans, we have utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to knock out ID3 and produce the full allelic series of rs11574 in human cells and validated a reproducible system for differentiation of human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to VSMC. We will quantify the changes in VSMC phenotype in iPSC-derived VSMC with the full allelic series of rs11574. To further translate murine findings to humans, intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH) will be measured in human coronary arteries and analyzed with cutting edge image analysis techniques in collaboration with Dr. Milan Sonka at the University of Iowa. As such, our group is uniquely poised to dissect the role of this ASCVD-associated SNP and translate findings to humans. We hypothesize: that loss of ID3 in VSMCs will inhibit VSMC growth and promote a phenotype that exacerbates vessel wall inflammation and atherosclerosis lesion development; that human ID3 encoded by the risk allele aggravates these atherogenic VSMC functions; and that human subjects with the risk allele have larger coronary plaques with increased fatty deposits, necrotic cores and calcification compared to subjects homozygous for the common allele. As atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and further impact on ASCVD morbidity and mortality. Human ID3 gene polymorphism at rs11574 is associated with ASCVD in three unique human cohorts. Preliminary data supports a key role for ID3 in vascular smooth muscle cell biology linked to ASCVD. In the current proposal, we will utilize a novel mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and specific deletion of ID3 to elucidate the role of ID3 in promoting atherogenic VSMCs. We will then utilize CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMCs to identify the VSMC processes altered by the ID3 gene mutation linked to CVD. Lastly, we will determine if this ID3 gene mutation, alone or in combination with other gene mutations are associated with the amount and type of atherosclerotic plaque in human coronary arteries as measured by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology.

"Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency Project Abstract Haploinsufficiency plays a crucial role in Neurofibromatosis (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder impacting over 120,000 individuals in the United States. Current therapeutic approaches focus on specific components of NF1 signaling, for example inhibiting MEK signaling pathways in tumors, thus failing to address the broad range of signaling and symptoms associated with NF1. Given that NF1 is characterized by both autosomal dominance and haploinsufficiency (lack of normal protein), upregulating protein expression of the remaining wild-type NF1 allele has the ability to compensate for loss of function from the mutant allele, thus alleviating a broad range of NF1 symptoms and overall disease progression. Infixion proposes to build a luciferase reporting assay to evaluate NF1 expression against known drugs, including 50+ compounds, across six drug classes, already identified by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression. By confirming that these candidate drugs activate NF1 transcription, increase NF1 protein expression, and normalize Ras pathway signaling in NF1 +/- Schwann cells, and by further screening libraries of known drugs for increased NF1 expression, we propose a novel path of NF1 drug discovery that will impact a broad range of NF1 patients and symptoms, in a preventative manner, and without regard to the wide spectrum of NF1 genetic mutations. Research Background. Increasing NF1 expression via transfection reverses abnormal Ras activation resulting from NF1 loss (Wallis, et al. 2018). Transcriptional activation in other genetic conditions such as Willams-Beuren Syndrome, and Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis compensates for haploinsufficiency (Giordano, et al. 2012). Lastly, overcoming haploinsufficiency in another autosomal dominant condition (Sim1 induced obesity; mouse model) was recently shown using a Crispr/dCas9 transcriptional activator (Ahituv, et al. 2019). Specific Aims. 1) Construct a luciferase reporter assay engineered into the endogenous NF1 gene of a well characterized, publically available, immortalized NF1 +/- Schwann cell line (Wallace et al. 2016; data published at Synapse.org). Validate assay using a viral transcription factor developed by Infixion using Crispr/dCas9 to upregulate NF1. 2) Deploy this NF1 luciferase reporter assay to screen 50+ known drugs shown by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression across various cell/tissue types. Next, use this validated luciferase reporter to screen a 13,000+ compound repurposing library of known drugs available from Scripps Research Institute (known as ReFrame). 3) The top hits from Aim 2 screens will be evaluated, utilizing both immortalized and iPSC derived NF1+/- Schwann cells, for the following: a) ability to induce NF1 mRNA and protein expression, using qPCR and Westerns, b) the impact on Ras signaling (pERK, ELK-1, AKT, etc.) utilizing a targeted quantitative mass spec proteomics assay, c) their broader impact on gene expression in Schwann cells utilizing RNAseq, d) impact on cell proliferation, and e) their safety profile based on published data from previous trials. The goal is to prioritize not more than 3-5 candidates to take forward into a Phase 2 evaluation. Project Narrative Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that impacts an estimated 1 in 3000 people worldwide, and one that is characterized by a complex set of symptoms shown to be dependent on haploinsufficiency (i.e., the lack of normal protein). By upregulating NF1 protein expression from the normal allele by two-fold, and thus restoring normal levels of functional NF1 protein in tissues important in NF1, we target a range of NF1 symptoms by eliminating the haploinsufficient environment. We propose to develop and utilize NF1-specific luciferase reporter and proteomic assays, along with standard small molecule evaluation tools, to characterize a small molecule library of repurposed drugs for their ability to upregulate NF1 transcription, and to further evaluate the resulting impact of “hits” on NF1 protein expression, cell proliferation, gene expression specificity, as well as downstream pathways (such as Ras, MEK, mTOR) known to be dysregulated by mutations in the NF1 gene.",Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency,10145101,R43NS117234,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dominant Genetic Conditions', 'Drug Screening', 'ELK1 gene', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Luciferases', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modification', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Obese Mice', 'Orphan Drugs', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Regimen', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schwann Cells', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure of thyroid parafollicular cell', 'Supravalvular aortic stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcend', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Williams Syndrome', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'commercialization', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'drug repurposing', 'gene expression database', 'gene therapy', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'in vivo Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Expression', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'phase 2 testing', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,"INFIXION BIOSCIENCE, INC.",R43,2021,150794
"Use of a Machine Learning Approach to Impute Gene Expression in African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY Multi-omics data has been invaluable in understanding the potential mechanisms behind SNP associations. Using paired genomic and transcriptomic data allows investigators to determine the tissue specific effects of non-coding variation. However, most of this type of data exists for mostly European ancestry populations. Linear models have been developed which that can impute gene expression from genotype data  mostly created from the GTEx resource. This resource contains paired genotype and gene expression data on 44 human tissues. Unfortunately, these models are built mostly on European data; they do not perform as well on African American (AA) cohorts. To alleviate this disparity in both knowledge and data we are proposing to use both or own African American paired data as well as public African American data to create linear and machine learning models to impute gene expression. We will then assess the utility of these models in predicting the risk on venous thromboembolism in our ACCOuNT cohort. By building on our current knowledge of transcriptome imputation, we will be advancing these methods to understudies admixed populations. NARRATIVE Paired genomic and transcriptomic data has previously been used to create gene expression imputation models. However, the majority of the data used to create these models were from European Ancestry individuals. We will create both linear and machine learning models using African American data to improve the imputation of gene expression in this understudied population and test the utility of these model to predict venous thromboembolism.",Use of a Machine Learning Approach to Impute Gene Expression in African Americans,10199406,R21HG011695,"['Address', 'African', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Benchmarking', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inheritance Patterns', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mosaicism', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'genomic data', 'human model', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'venous thromboembolism', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2021,239250
"Systems Biology of Shape and Size Regulation Abstract The molecular regulation of body shape and size during development and regeneration involves numerous pathways precisely integrated together with the biophysical properties of cellular and tissue dynamics, a complex process poorly understood at the level of whole animals. The overall goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the genetic regulation and coordination of large-scale tissue growth by developing and applying a novel integrated systems biology approach. Combining in vivo experiments and their morphological formalization with machine learning of mathematical biophysical models, we will discern the molecular mechanisms that control growth, shape, and size regulation. We will leverage the robustness of the planarian worm to address the molecular and physical mechanisms regulating their extraordinary homeostatic and regenerative capacity to grow, degrow, and regenerate their whole-body shapes and organs from almost any amputation and across one order of magnitude in sizes. This work will develop novel computational systems biology methods and integrate them with whole-body gene expression imaging and surgical and genetic manipulations assays to elucidate the molecular regulators of body shape and size. Morphological, genetic, and surgical data will be formalized with novel mathematical ontologies, which will serve as input to new machine learning methods able to infer mechanistic gene regulatory networks. The regulatory networks will be quantitatively modeled with a novel mathematical continuous approach for whole-body biophysical simulation, including tissue growth, adhesion molecules, and gene regulation. This computational framework combining machine learning with biophysical modeling will be able to discover the mechanisms of growth and shape regulation from large formalized experimental datasets. Novel genetic interactions will be discovered by the machine learning methodology, which predictions in terms of morphological and gene expression outcomes resulting from genetic and surgical manipulations will be validated at the bench via RNAi and in situ hybridization assays. Integrating machine learning, biophysical mathematical modeling, ontological formalizations, and in vivo surgical and molecular assays represents a comprehensive systems biology approach for elucidating the regulation of shape and size. This work will provide a mechanistic understanding of the diverse genetic pathways that regulate tissue growth dynamics and how they interact precisely between them and with tissue biophysics to create and maintain whole-body scale targeted shapes and sizes. This work will pave the way for new applications and novel therapies in human developmental, regenerative, and cancer medicine. Project Narrative The genetic regulation of the shape and size of internal organs and whole body is crucial during development, regeneration, and homeostasis. This project will develop a novel integrated systems biology approach to elucidate mechanistically the molecular pathways and their coordination that control large-scale tissue growth dynamics in living organisms.

"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,10058264,R01DE023575,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CDH1 gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryo Loss', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Mammalian Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nasal cavity', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Palate', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Periderm', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Domains', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'craniofacial', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'embryo tissue', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model building', 'mutant', 'network models', 'novel', 'oral cavity epithelium', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'paralogous gene', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,560204
"A next-generation morbid map of the human genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) on gene discovery and molecular diagnostics for Mendelian conditions (MCs) is hard to overstate. However, to provide affected individuals with precise natural history, recurrence risk, and prognosis in clinical settings, identification of pathogenic variant(s)/genotypes alone is often insufficient. This is a challenge most notably for genes that cause more than one MC or ~25% of all genes that underlie MCs. In such an instance, even with a known genotype a patient's phenotype has to be compared to that of all MCs caused by variants in a gene to determine which MC, if any, is the likely diagnosis or whether patient instead has a novel condition. This comparison is increasingly difficult because delineation of the ~5,100 MCs currently known has typically been based on subjective grouping of affected individuals by phenotypic similarity. We propose to develop a quantitative framework for assessing overlap among the distributions of phenotypes due to pathogenic genotypes the same gene and apply this framework genome-wide. NGS has enabled identification of causal genotypes in hundreds of thousands of individuals with MCs, providing a sufficiently large dataset that it is now feasible to use machine learning to quantitatively and systematically identify “clusters” of co-occurring genotypes and phenotypic features for each known gene. We will refine and validate our approach by comparing differences between conventionally-delineated and quantitatively-delineated MCs and by assessing the similarity of individuals with well-studied atypical phenotypes/genotypes to quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will then apply the optimal strategy across the genome to generate a “next- generation morbid map” based on quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will also apply machine learning approaches to identify genomic properties associated with the propensity for each gene to underlie multiple MCs (i.e., the numeric contribution of each gene to the morbid map or phenotropy). This will enable a more precise and complete understanding of the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of each MC, enable more objective diagnosis of individuals with atypical phenotypes, and more robustly identify the existence of multiple MCs among individuals with non-specific “class” phenotypes (e.g., developmental delay, autism, hearing impairment). We will make all newly developed methods publicly available via interactive and programmatic web-based tools to facilitate extension of this work to other human and model organism datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The major goals of this project are to develop a quantitative framework that enables objective delineation of Mendelian conditions, apply the framework to systematically delineate conditions across all genes known to underlie a Mendelian condition, and predict the number of conditions due to each gene. This framework will provide a fuller, unbiased characterization of the genotypic/phenotypic spectrum for all Mendelian conditions, enable more precise diagnoses and counseling of individuals with difficult to diagnose phenotypes, and accelerate the detection of new Mendelian conditions.",A next-generation morbid map of the human genome,10251153,R35HG011297,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'hearing impairment', 'large datasets', 'molecular diagnostics', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2021,454043
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery. NARRATIVE The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project will facilitate translational research by integrating and mining data about understudied druggable targets from numerous repositories and other resources.

"Epigenetic mechanisms of sustained transcription across cocaine abstinence PROJECT SUMMARY Cocaine addiction is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and high vulnerability to relapse even after prolonged abstinence. A major focus of the field of addiction research has therefore been to identify stable, cocaine-induced neuroadaptations occurring in brain reward circuits. Transcriptional changes are known to persist throughout abstinence, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms of such persistence remain elusive. We recently discovered that the transcription factor, Nr4a1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 4) represses cocaine reward and seeking behavior. Our preliminary data show that Nr4a1 is a central regulator of cocaine-induced transcription, including target gene expression in late abstinence. The significance of this study is strengthened by the utility of therapeutic agents that regulate Nr4a1 and block mouse cocaine self-administration, underscoring the enormous potential of this basic research program in combating drug addiction. Given that histone posttranslational modifications (hPTMs) confer long-lasting changes in gene expression necessary for stable cellular phenotypes, histone modifications acquired during abstinence may explain how individual genes “remember” prior drug exposure. We have previously found that Nr4a1 regulates hPTMs at individual target genes at late abstinence. This proposal aims to define the mechanism(s) of persistent gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of male and female mice following volitional cocaine self-administration. We apply novel methods for cell-type specific quantification of both chromatin and gene expression in a single sample. We then validate the causal mechanism of Nr4a1 action using epigenetic editing in vivo. At the conclusion of this study we will have defined the cell-type specific mechanism by which Nr4a1 regulates stable gene expression across cocaine abstinence. Beyond this, we will apply machine learning to identify novel regulators of persistent gene expression relevant to cocaine addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE One outstanding question in addiction biology concerns the mechanism by which neurological changes persist long past the cessation of drug taking. The persistent nature of epigenetic modifications may underlie their role in chronic psychiatric diseases, such as addiction and depression. This proposal aims to define the molecular mechanisms by which a key neuronal transcription factor, Nr4a1, leads to long-term change in gene expression that persist across cocaine abstinence.",Epigenetic mechanisms of sustained transcription across cocaine abstinence,10297955,R01DA052465,"['Abstinence', 'Attenuated', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'CARTPT gene', 'CRISPR interference', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Female', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histones', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Methyltransferase', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Volition', 'Work', 'addiction', 'attenuation', 'cell type', 'cocaine exposure', 'cocaine self-administration', 'craving', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'drug abstinence', 'epigenetic profiling', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'neuroadaptation', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'programs', 'rat orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1', 'recruit', 'small molecule', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,679084
"The adaptive potential of translational regulation Project Summary/Abstract  Our current understanding of the adaptive effects of mutation is largely limited to alterations in protein coding sequence and disruption of transcriptional cis-regulatory promoters. Very little is known about how mutations alter translation, or the role these mutations play in adaptation and evolution. This project seeks to address this gap by identifying the functional effect of mutations on translation. To accomplish this I will first identify mutations that arise from adaptation to various nutrient limited environments. I will then use expression profiling (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and RATE-seq) to identify the effect these mutations have on translation, as well as other levels of gene expression. This will provide insight into the magnitude of effect mutations have on translation and their relative rate. Furthermore, to fully characterize the role synonymous mutations have on fitness I will be using a deep scanning synonymous mutation library. To understand the role tRNA abundance plays in the fitness effect of a given synonymous mutations, I will also be evaluating fitness within tRNA under- and over-expression backgrounds. Because of the closely coupled nature of translation rates and mRNA decay, I will also characterize the effect synonymous mutations have on mRNA decay using RATE-seq. My analysis of the functional effects of these mutations on gene expression, particularly within the genetic background and environment in which they arose, will allow for the development of a machine learning algorithm that can use sequence and annotation features to predict the effect of a mutation on gene expression. This tool will aid future research into the effect mutations have of gene expression by allowing the identification of high-confidence candidates for further evaluation.  This project will be conducted at New York University’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, whose mission is to answer otherwise intractable biological questions using applied experimental and computational approaches. The Center houses numerous facilities and cores that will be instrumental in the performance of this work. The collaborative atmosphere and multi-disciplinary nature of NYU’s research communities that will enable me to stay abreast of developments in related fields and to rapidly communicate my research to interested parties. I will be trained under the guidance of Dr. David Gresham, an excellent researcher working on complementing long-term evolution experiments with gene expression studies to characterize the adaptive potential of the regulation of gene expression. Project Narrative The translation of mRNA into protein is a critical step in gene expression that is tightly regulated with mis-regulation of translation being a hallmark of many human pathologies. Understanding how mutations can alter the regulation of translation is an understudied but important aspect of adaptation and evolution.

"Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits Project Summary  Over the past decade, data generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to analyze heritability of human diseases and complex traits to improve understanding of genetic architecture, including identifying the genetic variants associated with diseases and their effect sizes. These heritability enrichment analyses have revealed underlying biological mechanisms such as regulatory elements involved in disease pathways. This research proposes statistical methods and analysis to formally assess the contribution of biological pathways, gene networks, and re-prioritized functional annotations to the genetic architecture of 94 human diseases and complex traits. Better understanding of disease architecture will improve genome-wide associations and fine mapping and provides robust inference of disease etiology and mechanisms.  The first aim is to determine the contribution of disease-associated gene pathways to disease heritability. It is well known that an abnormality in individual genes rarely causes a human disease. Large-scale pathway analysis will elucidate disease pathways by constructing functional annotations and applying an existing polygenic method to partition heritability. Furthermore, pathway analyses on candidate genes identified via whole-exome sequencing (WES) data will inform new biological inference. The resulting set of enriched pathway-trait pairs will further help with independent validation of previously reported associations and for novel associations enriched for trait heritability.  The second aim is to determine the contribution of gene network to disease heritability across 94 diseases, focusing on hub genes defined by a broad set of network connectivity metrics. The contribution of gene network to disease heritability has been only partially answered, limited to few network connectivity metrics across 42 diseases. Comprehensive analysis of gene sets informed by published gene networks will inform a new direction of integrating gene networks to infer biological mechanisms of human diseases. In addition, visualization method for large-scale gene networks will greatly enhance research translation, serving as a useful resource for studying gene-gene interactions for potential drugs and therapeutic targets.  The third aim is to de-noise and re-prioritize Mendelian annotations to infer candidate genes. Despite considerable process on prioritizing rare variants impacting Mendelian diseases, little is known about the utility of these Mendelian pathogenicity scores for common disease. I will conduct heritability enrichment analyses to answer informativeness of Mendelian disease pathogenicity scores for common disease. To further improve their informativeness, I propose a machine learning variant reprioritization framework. Ultimately, this project will produce (1) a detailed understanding of disease-associated biological pathways to disease heritability, (2) a set of functional annotations informed by gene networks significantly enriched for disease heritability, and (3) a new method to prioritize variants and identifying candidate genes based on diverse genomic features. Project Narrative Understanding human genetic variations, from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to mutations, offers a great potential in uncovering underlying disease mechanisms by identifying new disease-associated genes and in discovering potential drug targets and therapeutics. This proposed studies aim to understand the role of these genetic variations in trait heritability, leveraging disease-associated biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations. The developed method to prioritize variants and genes will answer the contribution of gene pathways, gene sets informed by gene networks, and Mendelian pathogenicity scores to disease heritability.","Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits",10126720,F31HG010818,"['Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'denoising', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'fitness', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'open source', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2021,46036
