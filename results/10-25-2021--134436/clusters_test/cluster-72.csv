"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy in a double-blinded study of 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Additional aims are to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment and identify the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of using modern neuroimaging techniques.",Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis,10249978,R01DC016800,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Randomized', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavioral neurology', 'clinical investigation', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'predicting response', 'primary outcome', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,578602
"AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hearing loss, visual impairment, and in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. It is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness in humans. USH causes extensive degeneration in the cochlear nerve (CN), especially in CN fibers innervating the base of the cochlea. Whereas there is no treatment for arresting this degenerative process or for restoring visual loss, the restoration of auditory input is possible with cochlear implantation. Due to the progressive deterioration in vision, using visual cues for communication will eventually become impossible. Therefore, the importance of optimizing auditory inputs through cochlear implants (CIs) for patients with USH is paramount. However, patients with USH have much higher rates of neurological, mental, or behavioral disorders than the general CI patient population, which limits their ability to provide reliable behavioral responses or sufficient verbal descriptions of their auditory perception, especially for pediatric patients. In addition, optimal programming parameters for CI users with CN damage differ from those used in typical CI users due to declined CN responsiveness to electrical stimulation. As a result, the clinical programming process in implanted patients with USH can be extremely challenging. To date, auditory neural encoding of electrical stimulation in patients with USH has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, the field lacks evidence-based practice guidelines for managing implanted patients with USH. For patients who cannot provide reliable feedback, clinicians rely on a “trial-and-error” approach for adjusting CI programming settings, which ultimately may not result in appropriate programming maps for individual patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop objective clinical tools for optimizing CI settings for these patients. As the first step toward developing evidence-based practice for managing patients with USH, this study evaluates local neural health, as well as the neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN in implanted patients with USH. Aim 1 will determine local CN health in patients with USH by assessing the sensitivity of the electrically evoked compound action potential to changes in interphase gap and pulse polarity. Aim 2 will determine group differences in neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN between patients with USH and patients with idiopathic hearing loss. Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning techniques to develop an objective tool for assessing the electrode-neuron interface at individual electrode locations. Results of this study have high scientific significance because they will establish how CN degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, and identify tests that distinguish the loss of spiral ganglion neurons from the loss of peripheral axons. Results of this study also have high clinical significance because they will 1) lay the groundwork for developing effective, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for managing patients with USH, and 2) yield an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neuron interface in all CI users, which is foundational for creating optimal programming maps for individual patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health because it aims to better understand neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation in patients with Usher syndrome (USH) – an autosomal recessive disorder that is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness. Results from this study will have a broad impact on the field by 1) establishing how cochlear nerve degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, 2) identifying tests that distinctly evaluate the loss in the spiral ganglion cells vs the loss in the peripheral axon, and 3) yielding an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neural interface in all cochlear implant users. Results from this study will also have a targeted impact on implanted patients with USH by laying the groundwork for developing an effective, evidence-based clinical practice for managing these patients. This project is relevant to the mission of NIH because it seeks fundamental knowledge about the nature of electrical hearing in patients with USH and strives to apply this knowledge to reduce disability in all patients with cochlear implants.",AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME,10192995,R21DC019458,"['Accounting', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory system', 'Axon', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear Nerve', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Deterioration', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evidence based practice', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Interphase', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery of Function', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Retinitis Pigmentosa', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Usher Syndrome', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'axonal degeneration', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'daily functioning', 'deaf', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'ganglion cell', 'hearing impairment', 'histological studies', 'individual patient', 'model development', 'nerve damage', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuron loss', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'point of care', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'restoration', 'spiral ganglion', 'supervised learning', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,196406
"PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device Project Summary/Abstract  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project proposes the deployment of an AI-powered image-processing tool, named PostureCheck™, to automatically detect when patients perform undesirable compensatory movements during robot-assisted upper-extremity (UE) rehabilitation exercises. The system is based on a standard video camera and the artificial intelligence (AI) software developed under the NIH Phase-I project. PostureCheck™ will be fully integrated with Barrett Technology's existing Burt® UE rehabilitation robot, ensuring that patients are provided appropriate and timely feedback to encourage the correct performance of therapeutic exercises without requiring constant therapist supervision.  Burt® is an FDA-listed UE rehabilitation robot that supports the weight of a patient's arm and hand while the patient moves his/her arm to interact with on-screen games. Burt® offers guided assistance, visual and haptic feedback, and activities and assessments to both help train the patient and measure progress. Clinical studies have shown that Burt® can be used to improve patients' performance in one-on-one sessions with a therapist. However, the system lacks the capability for a single therapist to monitor and work with several patients and Burt® systems at one time.  The proposed SBIR Phase-II activities are organized in three aims. In Aim 1, the annotated dataset generated in Phase-I will be used to develop three separate AI modules. These modules will be integrated into a framework that allows therapists to monitor the outcome of the modules, and, through feedback, enable the system to auto- adapt to improve performance continuously. In Aim 2, stakeholder feedback will be gathered and integrated to design multiple user interfaces for the PostureCheck™ tool. Specific interfaces will be created for use by therapists during and after RT sessions. PostureCheck™ will be integrated with the Burt® device to empower therapists to provide effective feedback to patients and deter the use of compensatory movements. Finally, in Aim 3, forty-two stroke survivors will be recruited in an interventional study deploying the PostureCheck™ and Burt® systems. Subjects will undergo eighteen RT sessions in either an individual or group therapy format. Motor performance between groups will be compared to gather information about the suitability of the combined systems for multi-patient RT therapy in future rehabilitation centers.  The long-term commercial goal of the project is to provide a practical Burt®-plus-PostureCheck™ system to empower therapists to supervise multiple patients simultaneously through a gamut of useful functionalities. The system will be suitable for deployment in clinics as well as rehabilitation centers such as wellness gyms. Project Narrative  Each year, more than 650,000 Americans survive a type of stroke that particularly weakens one side of the body in most cases. During upper-limb rehabilitation, appropriate feedback from a therapist to discourage stroke survivors from performing undesirable compensatory movements results in better motor recovery and ultimately improved function. This proposal aims to expand PostureCheck™, to provide timely and targeted feedback and enable therapists to perform robot-assisted and multi-patient therapy in a minimally supervised session.",PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device,10156853,R44EB027525,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Group Therapy', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation device', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'chronic stroke', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'haptic feedback', 'image processing', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'interest', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'robot assistance', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'software development', 'stroke patient', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIBIB,"BARRETT TECHNOLOGY, LLC",R44,2021,813419
"Efficient mapping of neuromodulation therapy parameters to complex biomarker spaces Introduction: The neuromodulation field has seen many early successes in converting therapies into clinical application, but challenges remain in reducing off-target effects for new indications as well as targeting therapies to ensure clinical and commercial viability. Challenges have arisen validating preclinical successes in clinical settings due to the differences between preclinical and clinical subjects leading to different stimulation parameters required. These challenges have impeded the expansion of neuromodulation to new indications [Herring 2019]. Herein we aim to show how the information in the neural signals can be leveraged to quantify and avoid off-target effects [Ardell 2017] providing better specificity for future therapies. Outline of the project: We propose utilising existing SPARC data to build an efficient method of searching the stimulation parameter space using Bayesian Optimisation with Gaussian Processes as a data-efficient way of modelling the stimulation response function. Furthermore, we will build a machine learning model for mapping neural signals into a compressed representation (termed Neural Biomarkers) in order to interpret the body’s neural signals as effective measures of organ function. Finally, we validate both approaches in acute and chronic large animal models where stimulation parameters are searched extensively through the input space and further optimised against neural biomarkers derived from the neural signals. n/a",Efficient mapping of neuromodulation therapy parameters to complex biomarker spaces,10208032,OT2OD030536,"['Acute', 'Animal Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clupeidae', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'clinical application', 'improved', 'insight', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",OD,BIOS HEALTH LTD,OT2,2021,859337
"Neural circuits for action perception: An integrative approach Project summary Social interactions – a ubiquitous and essential aspect of our everyday life – rely on the correct perception of the actions of others. Experimental evidence suggests that the ability to interpret others’ actions is subserved by a network of areas of which motor cortex represents an important hub. The precise role of this motor hub in action perception is still largely unknown. In this proposal, we will assess the mechanisms underlying action perception through invasive recordings of intracranial field potential signals in humans and computational analyses methods. This approach will allow us to study the role of motor processes in action perception with high spatiotemporal accuracy. Project narrative The correct perception of the actions of others is the cornerstone of our social interactions. The neural substrates of this fundamental skill are still poorly understood. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying action perception will have important implications for mental health disorders characterized by dysfunctional social interactions such as autism. Furthermore, given the present trend toward interactions with embodied artificial agents, biological insights about action perception will also inform the design of future human-robot interaction paradigms. Here we will examine the neural circuits responsible for action perception through invasive neurophysiological recordings in humans.",Neural circuits for action perception: An integrative approach,10301963,R21EY032180,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'design', 'frontal lobe', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'human-robot interaction', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'motor control', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'trend']",NEI,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,260110
"Non invasive vagal nerve stimulation in opioid use disorders Opioid addiction is a major crisis of epidemic proportions and drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. Treatment of Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs) includes medications with effects on opioid receptors such as buprenorphine, but access is limited for many patients. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that has been shown in recent studies to be equivalent in efficacy to buprenorphine. Initiation of treatment with long-acting naltrexone, however, requires a period of abstinence of about seven days during which time patients suffer from intense symptoms of withdrawal with a risk of relapse that can lead to overdose-related death. Opioids have an inhibitory effect on norepinephrine and the sympathetic nervous system, and many symptoms of withdrawal are driven by rebound activation of these systems. Dopaminergic systems in brain areas including ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) and medial prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate) play an important role in opioid addiction, craving and relapse, as do increases in inflammation. This project will assess a form of neuromodulation involving non-invasive electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve that may play a useful role during the period of opioid withdrawal before the initiation of long-term naltrexone treatment in blocking norepinephrine, sympathetic, and inflammatory responses and enhancing peripheral parasympathetic and central brain function in areas modulating drug craving (ventral striatum, anterior cingulate). Our preliminary data on the effects of non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) on stress response in traumatized human subjects and patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show that nVNS reliably blocks peripheral sympathetic and enhances parasympathetic function, reduces inflammatory responses (interleukin-6, or IL-6), and enhances central brain responses (anterior cingulate) to stress. We now propose to apply this technology to the treatment of patients with OUDs. Following verification using modelling and determination of optimal dosing parameters, we will use these parameters to assess effects of nVNS versus sham stimulation on opioid craving, peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and brain functional responses measured with High-Resolution Positron Emission Tomography (HR-PET) and radiolabeled water to videos of drug cues in recently treated patients with OUDs. Based on the outcome of this research, we will proceed to the UH3 phase, which will involve a randomized, sham-controlled trial of nVNS in patients with OUDs during the one to two week period of opioid withdrawal followed by assessment of craving, HR-PET imaging of both brain function and brain dopaminergic function, and assessment of peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular and inflammatory responses in conjunction with administration of nVNS or sham. We hypothesize that nVNS will reduce opioid craving and inflammatory, peripheral autonomic and cardiovascular responses and enhance brain responses (anterior cingulate function and dopamine function in ventral striatum), and promote successful conversion to long-acting naltrexone, in patients with OUDs. Project Narrative Opioid use disorders (OUDs) have been associated with a 4-fold increase in drug overdose deaths in the past decade, and current treatments including medications that block the opioid receptor require a withdrawal period during which time many patients relapse and tragically may overdose and die. This project will assess a new device, non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS), that does not require surgery or implantation, and that electrically stimulates the vagus nerve as it passes through the neck, dampening the sympathetic nervous system and modulating brain regions in a way that may help patients during the opioid withdrawal period and reduce relapse. Studying the effects of nVNS on opioid craving and brain and physiological responses in patients with OUDs has the potential to reduce relapse and save lives, as well as increase our knowledge of changes to the brain and physiology that underlie OUDs and successful response to treatment.",Non invasive vagal nerve stimulation in opioid use disorders,10376890,UG3DA048502,"['Abstinence', 'Adverse reactions', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Dose', 'Drug usage', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Epidemic', 'Family', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Imagery', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Naltrexone', 'Neck', 'Nerve', 'Norepinephrine', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Radiolabeled', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Validation', 'Vasomotor', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'craving', 'drug craving', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'neuroregulation', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'overdose death', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'tomography', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'vasoconstriction']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,UG3,2021,90990
"Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models ABSTRACT  Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease (after Alzheimer's disease), afflicting tens of millions worldwide. The characteristic disease symptoms arise from basal ganglia dysfunction that occurs secondary to loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Symptomatic treatment is focused either on replacing dopamine or disrupting aberrant activity through deep- brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus or the primary basal ganglia output nucleus in the primate, internal globus pallidus (GPi). This proposal is aimed at understanding the function and dysfunction of basal ganglia circuitry in mice, at the output of the basal ganglia to motor thalamus. In Aim 1, we will develop strategies to identify basal ganglia-recipient motor thalamus neurons in ventral anterior/ventral lateral thalamus (VA/VL), and characterize their projection targets and cortical inputs in awake, behaving animals. In Aim 2, we will use sophisticated in vivo strategies to record from posterior EP neurons and VA/VL neurons as animals move their limbs during locomotion, a fixed repetitive behavior. We will perturb activity in this pathway using optogenetics to determine the contribution of activity in these neurons to forelimb movements, and we will examine how activity in this pathway is altered after loss of striatal dopamine. In Aim 3, we will perform similar experiments in mice performing a lever-pulling task, a flexible forelimb movement. We will examine both cued and uncued versions of this task to distinguish activity generated internally vs. externally. Finally, we will examine how loss of striatal dopamine impacts EP and VA/VL activity during flexible forelimb movements. Our overarching goal is to understand how loss of striatal dopamine in PD leads to disruptions in basal ganglia circuit function and motor deficits, in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating PD motor symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) results from a progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the midbrain, most of which innervate the basal ganglia. Here, we propose to study the effects of dopamine loss in mice, focusing on the function of the entopeduncular nucleus (a rodent equivalent of the internal globus pallidus, major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, and a site of deep brain stimulation in PD) and the ventral motor thalamus. Remarkably, the function of these regions remains mysterious, yet they hold great promise for understanding PD and developing new therapeutic strategies for treating PD symptoms.",Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models,10093142,R01NS064984,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Axon', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain Stem', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dopamine', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Eye Movements', 'Forelimb', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homologous Gene', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'Subthalamic structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'awake', 'base', 'body position', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'density', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'endopeduncular nucleus', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'motor symptom', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'parkinsonian rodent', 'pars compacta', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NINDS,J.

"Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in the United States, affecting 4% of all adults over the age of 40. For individuals whose motor symptoms are refractory to medication and significantly impair their daily living, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered to be the only bilateral therapeutic option. Despite recent advances in DBS technology, a significant portion of ET patients with DBS implants will receive inadequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads, while others will lose efficacy of the therapy after 1-2 years due in part to inflexible neurostimulator programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs and programming algorithms that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields within the brain, especially in cases where stimulation through a poorly placed DBS lead results in low-threshold side-effects. Our proposed study will integrate high-field magnetic resonance imaging, histological neurotracing of fiber pathways, computational modeling of DBS, and single-cell electrophysiology methods to further develop and experimentally-validate a novel semi-automated machine learning algorithm that facilitates hypothesis-driven determination of subject-specific neurostimulator settings through directional DBS leads. Specifically, we will: 1) identify the neural pathways involved in the reduction of action and postural tremor using directional DBS leads and a novel particle swarm optimization algorithm based on subject-specific anatomy; 2) quantify how tremor-related information is modulated on the single-cell, population, and network levels by therapeutic DBS in a preclinical large-animal model of harmline-induced tremor; and 3) investigate how therapeutic windows (i.e. the threshold difference between postural and action tremor abolishment and side effect emergence) change over time with human DBS therapy targeting one or more pathways within the cerebello-thalamoc-cortical network. Together, this project will (a) experimentally evaluate and translate a novel DBS programming algorithm to human ET patients, (b) provide a much more detailed map of the neural pathways underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS (on postural and action tremor) and side effects of DBS (on dysarthria, paresthesia, ataxia), (c) rigorously investigate how DBS for treating tremor works mechanistically at the single cell and network levels within the brain, and (d) probe the neural pathways involved in the worsening of tremor symptoms for ET patients over time. NARRATIVE Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a proven therapy for patients with medication-refractory essential tremor, but a significant portion of patients with these implants do not receive adequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads or inflexible DBS programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields in the brain to improve the functional outcome for all patients requiring DBS to manage their essential tremor. Our research study will experimentally evaluate a novel machine learning algorithm for programming directional DBS leads implanted within thalamus to more precisely identify and effectively target the pathways and circuits involved in (a) cessation of action and postural tremor, and (b) worsening of tremor symptoms over time.",Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor,10246791,R01NS081118,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dysarthria', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Essential Tremor', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Harmaline', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intention Tremor', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Paresthesia', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Primates', 'Radiation', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'United States', 'Utah', 'Work', 'arm', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'deep brain stimulation array', 'density', 'design', 'electric field', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic field', 'motor symptom', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'particle', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'research study', 'side effect', 'somatosensory', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'zona incerta']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,542822
"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,10065509,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Well Child Visits', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'screening services', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2021,605422
"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform targeted interventions.",Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders,10118191,K23HD099275,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Life Experience', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal Brain Injury', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Space Perception', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual Motor Coordinations', 'advanced analytics', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'standardize measure', 'statistics', 'study population', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2021,177444
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,10187663,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Dementia with Lewy Bodies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos', 's', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,75097
"Neural Encoding of Motor Precision for Advancing Brain-Machine Interfaces Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have progressed rapidly through technological advances that allow recording chronically from large numbers of neurons, more computational power, better training, and better regression algorithms for estimating neural tuning. However, current BMIs rely almost exclusively on fixed, linear models of neural encoding that are the same for all types of movements. These fixed models are the same whether the movements are fast or slow, and the same no matter which degrees of freedom require the most precision for a particular task. In part, this limitation of current BMIs reflects inadequate basic knowledge concerning how the brain controls movement at different levels of precision. To advance the field, the present project will test the hypotheses that 1) specific changes occur in the neural activity of the motor cortex depending on the precision required, and 2) more flexible, non-linear algorithms that adjust precision and actively select from multiple linear decoders will enable BMI performance closer to that of normal humans.  This general hypothesis will be tested with two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will examine selective neural encoding of movement precision when the instructed precision is varied systematically in a reach and grasp task. Aim 2 will examine improving BMI performance using novel neural signal input to BMI output transforms. This novel BMI experiment will focus on using multiple dimensions of neural activity to improve precision along a given degree of freedom.  In pursuing these Specific Aims, I will receive additional training to advance my career and transition from my current post-doctoral associate position to that of an independent, tenure-track faculty member by developing a research program that bridges the fields of neural control of movement, BMI design, and computational neuroscience. During my K99 years, I will advance my training in computational neuroscience, mentored by Drs. Sridevi Sarma and Robert Jacobs. With Dr. Sarma, I will focus on statistical modeling of neural activity using point process modeling. With Dr. Jacobs, I will focus on applying mixture models and gain-scheduling for BMIs. By the end of my K99 years, I thus will have expertise in three complementary disciplines—motor neurophysiology, BMI, and computational neuroscience—all contributing to the success of my transition to independence. The proposed studies will test ways to help patients with paralysis use a brain-machine interface to perform a more diverse set of tasks. The proposed methods and results of these studies will help to develop neuroprosthetic devices that allow movements that are more precise and intuitive to the user.",Neural Encoding of Motor Precision for Advancing Brain-Machine Interfaces,10102284,R00NS101127,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Athletic', 'Behavior', 'Career Mobility', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Freedom', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Nervous System control', 'Neurons', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Research', 'Schedule', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Weight', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'bridge program', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'member', 'mind control', 'neural model', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroprosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'regression algorithm', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'success', 'tenure track']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R00,2021,249000
"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic.

"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. .

"An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms An intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) is used to record electrical signals directly from a person's brain, predict their intention from those signals, then control an assistive device (e.g., a computer cursor, prosthetic limb, or powered wheelchair) according to those intentions. This technology enables severely paralyzed people to interact with the world. However, designing robust algorithms to extract intent from recordings of single neurons is extremely challenging, in large part because of the very limited access to humans, or even monkeys, from whom these invasive recordings can be made. In this project, we will develop a model iBCI system that generates real-time biomimetic neural data by capturing the high-degree-of-freedom finger movements of able-bodied human subjects. To accomplish this, we will construct a modular recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN will be trained to predict the motor cortex activity of a monkey from the monkey's own finger kinematics. Small modules of the RNN will be interchanged according the particular animal or recording session to model the high inter-session variability present in motor cortex. Once the modular RNN is trained, its weights will be fixed and human finger kinematics will be used as the RNN inputs, which will generate subject-controlled emulated neural activity. The emulated neural activity can be passed to iBCI decoding algorithms that control computer cursors or other physical devices, allowing human subjects to interact directly with decoders in real time, closed-loop conditions. We call this model system the jaBCI. The jaBCI is low cost and noninvasive, making it possible to rapidly test and design novel iBCI decoders using statistically rigorous sample sizes. The project will be executed in close collaboration with intracortical microelectrode array data expert Dr. Lee Miller at Northwestern University. Dr. Miller's lab, with the help of our consultant Dr. Mathis, will obtain simultaneous finger kinematics and neural activity of monkey subjects that will serve as the training data for the RNN component of the iBCI model. We will validate the emulated neural data generated by the jaBCI across many measures to ensure the model captures as many features of intracortical data as possible. These include comparing the model and actual iBCI in subject performance, learning rates, control strategies, neural variation across days, neural firing rate distributions, and low-dimensional neural dynamics. With the validated model, we will undertake a study to rigorously evaluate the highest performing, current state-of-the-art iBCI decoders. This will yield useful insight into the features of decoders that yield the greatest performance gains, overcoming the current impossibility to compare iBCI decoders in well-controlled studies using more than two or three naïve human subjects. We will also use the iBCI model to evaluate novel decoder designs, and to determine the features of neural dynamics that are consistent across common iBCI tasks to help focus decoder development on those features. Narrative Brain-computer interfaces are systems that translate the electrical neural signatures of thought into instructions for a personal computer or powered wheelchair, which is an incredibly useful technology to help paralyzed people regain some independence and ability to communicate. This work would develop a tool that scientists can use to design, test, and optimize the sophisticated computer programs that translate brain signals into device instructions without having to implant electrodes into a person's brain until the program is completed and rigorously tested.

"Thalamocortical Responsive Neurostimulation for the Treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Project Summary / Abstract  Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a devastating form of childhood onset epilepsy with cognitive dysfunction and very frequent generalized onset seizures (GOS) often leading to injury. Driven by the lack of effective therapies and the demonstrated safety and efficacy of brain-responsive stimulation for medically intractable focal onset seizures (FOS), this study will test whether brain-responsive neurostimulation of thalamocortical networks (RNS-TCN) is a feasible strategy to treat LGS. Specifically, the project aims to: (1) acquire preliminary evidence for safety and efficacy in treating GOS of LGS with RNS-TCN; (2) create an interactive therapy-decision support system based on patient-specific computational network models and machine learning to identify optimal lead placement and stimulation parameters.  Using the RNS® System, which is FDA approved for FOS, an early feasibility IDE study will be conducted at 6 epilepsy centers in 20 patients with LGS and medically intractable GOS. The patients will be enrolled in two cohorts of 10, with safety and efficacy milestones in the first cohort governing the enrollment of the second cohort. Patients will have two depth leads placed bilaterally in the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus and two subdural strip leads placed bilaterally on the medial prefrontal cortex. These targets are selected because they are implicated in the onset and spread of GOS in LGS. Leads will be located within each target such that stimulation maximally engages the thalamocortical network, guided by finite-element biophysical models created from structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion weighted imaging. The finite-element biophysical models will also be used to identify the initial RNS-TCN stimulation pathway and current amplitude. During the blinded evaluation period patients will be randomized to receive either high-frequency short burst (HFSB) or low-frequency long burst (LFLB) RNS-TCN, then enter a washout period before crossing over to receive the other treatment condition. During the open label period stimulation parameters can be modified at the discretion of the physician. Parameter adjustments will be informed by using a Bayesian optimization model developed for specifically for each patient. All clinical and electrophysiological data collected during the study will be used to identify a biomarker of clinical response; if found, these will aid future epilepsy research and clinical practice. If safety is favorable and there is preliminary evidence for efficacy, then this early experience will inform the design of a future larger feasibility study.  In addition to treating a population in need, this project engages in fundamental discovery of biomarkers in generalized network epilepsies, and develops novel automated therapy selection policies that have the potential to improve the lives of patients with LGS and other seizure disorders. Project Narrative Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a devastating form of childhood onset epilepsy characterized by cognitive dysfunction and very frequent generalized onset seizures (GOS) that often lead to injury. Driven by the lack of effective therapies and the demonstrated safety and efficacy of brain-responsive stimulation for treating medically intractable focal onset seizures, this study will test whether brain-responsive neurostimulation can also be used to treat LGS.

"Cell Type Specific Genetic Manipulation to Dissect Cholinergic Interneuron Function and Plasticity in a Symptomatic Model of DYT1 Dystonia Project Summary/Abstract Cholinergic neurons (ChIs) are a central but poorly understood element of striatal circuitry. A considerable literature strongly implicates ChI dysfunction in the pathogenesis of abnormal movements, especially in dystonia and levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson disease. A common theme of these studies is that maladaptive plastic changes cause aberrant ChI output and connectivity, promoting motor dysfunction. The central goal of this proposal is to advance understanding of the cellular and synaptic mechanisms through which ChIs cause motor dysfunction by employing novel selective genetic and chemical strategies in a recently validated model of DYT1 dystonia. Conditional Knock Out of torsinA from all striatal neurons (using Dlx5/6-Cre; “Dlx-CKO”) causes selective neurodegeneration of dorsolateral striatal ChI. ChI degeneration occurs roughly coincident with the juvenile onset of abnormal twisting movements in these mice, and selective ChI abnormalities are also present in postmortem tissue from DYT1 subjects. These movements are suppressed by the same anti-muscarinic compounds used to treat patients with DYT1 dystonia, establishing model therapeutic validity and suggesting shared pathophysiology with human dystonia. Surviving striatal ChIs are enlarged and hyperexcitable, and receive aberrant synaptic inputs. Selective ablation of these surviving ChI suppresses abnormal twisting, implicating these cells as key contributors to abnormal movements. Based on these data, we hypothesize that maladaptations in surviving ChIs drive motor dysfunction. Successful completion of the proposed studies will fundamentally advance understanding of maladaptive mechanisms whereby ChI function and connectivity drive abnormal movements, information highly significant for multiple striatal diseases. We will first address our hypothesis by testing the necessity of striatal ChI dysfunction in abnormal movement generation by selectively restoring torsinA to these cells (Aim 1), decisively moving beyond the current association between these factors. We will determine if cholinergic dysfunction arises primarily from intrinsic ChI abnormalities or defects in how they respond to afferents (Aim 2), and, informed by Aims 1 and 2, will pursue translational studies (Aim 3) testing whether directly modulating the activity of surviving ChIs can suppress dystonic-like movements. This proposal is therefore highly signifiant because it will define a circuit-based model of motor dysfunction that will inform the design of targeted therapeutics. Project Narrative DYT1 dystonia is an incurable brain disease characterized by involuntary twisting movements for which there are no reliably effective treatments. This proposal employs unique genetic strategies to target a specific class of neurons (striatal cholinergic interneurons) that appear essential to the abnormal movements. These advanced genetic studies will establish the role of cholinergic interneurons in dystonia and test a novel approach to prevent or suppress the disease symptoms.",Cell Type Specific Genetic Manipulation to Dissect Cholinergic Interneuron Function and Plasticity in a Symptomatic Model of DYT1 Dystonia,10210051,R01NS110853,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Autopsy', 'Autoreceptors', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug usage', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Dystonia', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'L-DOPA induced dyskinesia', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publishing', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'TorsinA', 'base', 'cell type', 'cholinergic', 'cholinergic neuron', 'conditional knockout', 'design', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'effective therapy', 'genetic approach', 'genetic manipulation', 'loss of function mutation', 'motor behavior', 'motor disorder', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'targeted treatment', 'tomography', 'tool', 'translational study']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,516285
"Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors Project Summary Behavior is movement, and the effective and efficient execution of movement has served as a fundamental evolutionary force shaping the form and function of the nervous system. Control of the forelimbs to interact with the world is one of the most essential achievements of the mammalian motor system, yet unfortunately these behaviors are particularly vulnerable to disease and injury. The execution of skilled limb movements requires the continuous refinement of motor output across dozens of muscles, suggesting the existence of feedback pathways that enable rapid adjustments. The temporal delays of peripheral pathways, however, suggest that sensory feedback alone cannot explain the sophistication of online motor control. In principle, a more rapid source of feedback would be to convey copies of motor commands internally to the cerebellum to generate predictions of motor outcome, reducing dependence on delayed sensory information. Yet putative copy circuits have been difficult to isolate experimentally, leaving their contributions to movement unclear. Mouse genetic tools offer a means to explore a diverse class of spinal interneurons as a neural substrate for internal copies. Cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs) receive descending motor command input and extend bifurcating axons; one branch projects to forelimb motor neurons and the other projects to the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), a major cerebellar input, providing an anatomically straightforward means to convey motor copies internally. Yet how diverse classes of PN-LRN circuits are organized and how they each contribute to distinct elements of limb behavior remain unclear. Complicating the problem, the field lacks robust ways for deconstructing complex limb movements into component elements (e.g. reaching, grasping, postural control), and objective means for quantifying these behaviors in mice. Hypothesis: Discrete classes of PN circuits convey distinct types of spinal motor copy information to the LRN, each necessary for separate aspects of forelimb control; this functional logic can be resolved with more quantitative, high-resolution and standardized behavioral assays. To test this overarching hypothesis, Aim 1 uses molecular-genetic circuit mapping approaches and single-cell RNA- sequencing to define the anatomical and molecular organization of four classes of PN-LRN circuits. Identifying the fine-grained structure of these diverse pathways will be essential for establishing how internal copies are conveyed to the cerebellum to control forelimb behavior. Aim 2 addresses the need for more sensitive and unbiased behavioral tools by developing novel assays of discrete elements of forelimb behavior and machine learning approaches for automated quantification of forelimb kinematics. Finally, Aim 3 merges these novel behavioral approaches with intersectional genetic tools, electrophysiological recording and circuit-specific perturbation to functionally dissect PN-LRN circuits and define their modular contributions to dexterous limb control. Ultimately, these studies will yield insight into the function of internal copy circuits throughout the nervous system, and help to lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits. Project Narrative In addition to promoting basic science investigation of motor function, this work can impact the study of motor dysfunction. Skilled movements of the arm and hand are particularly susceptible to disease and injury of the motor system, raising the need for a better understanding of motor circuit organization and more informative strategies for studying the behaviors these circuits control. Merging molecular-genetic tools with novel behavioral approaches will offer a more detailed and comprehensive approach to studying movement, helping to provide greater insight into the neural basis of motor deficits as well as more effective ways to restore or replace lost motor function.","Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors",10201782,R01NS111479,"['Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebellum', 'Cervical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Postural adjustments', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Rabies', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'molecular subtypes', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'mouse genetics', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory feedback', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2021,587128
"Coding of Action by Motor & Premotor Cortical Ensembles Abstract The goal of this project is to understand how spatio-temporal patterns of activity across motor cortex initiate different types of voluntary movements. Large distributed ensembles of motor cortical neurons begin modulating their firing rates prior to voluntary movement and are thought to causally generate these movements. However, it is still unresolved why movement is not initiated when similar modulations in single unit motor cortical activity occur during movement planning, imagery, and visual observation of action. The amplitude of local field potential (LFP) oscillations in the beta frequency (15-40 Hz) range is known to attenuate prior to movement onset and is considered a mesoscopic signature of corticospinal excitability. We have recently discovered a sequential pattern of LFP beta attenuation and single unit modulation timing in primary motor cortex that is spatially organized prior to reaching movement onset but not during movement preparation. Our working hypothesis is that such a propagating sequential pattern is necessary to initiate movement. In this project, we will test and extend this hypothesis by demonstrating that such propagating patterns generalize to movement initiation of different behaviors including 2D reaching under different conditions, more complex 3D reach-to-grasp, and tongue protrusion and occur in premotor cortex. We will first demonstrate that propagating sequences in beta attenuation and single unit modulation timing occur during initiation of each of these behaviors along different portions of the somatotopic map of primary motor and premotor cortices. Second, we will provide a causal link between these propagating patterns and movement initiation by applying subthreshold, spatio-temporal patterns of electrical stimulation. We will demonstrate that movement initiation is delayed when patterned stimulation travels against the natural propagating sequence but not when it mimics the natural propagating pattern. Third, we will provide a mechanistic explanation of how these propagating sequences lead to muscle activation that supports movement initiation using patterned stimulus-triggered muscle activity and muscle decoding. To accomplish these aims, four high-density electrode arrays will be chronically implanted in the either the upper limb or orofacial areas of primary motor and premotor cortices from which 100s of single units and LFPs will be simultaneously recorded. A two-link exoskeletal robot and a motion tracking system using a set of fourteen infrared cameras will monitor the kinematics of the arm and hand. A strain gauge will measure tongue force and kinematics of the tongue will be tracked with a novel 3D x-ray fluoroscopy system. Indwelling EMG electrodes will also measure activity from arm, hand, and tongue muscles. A set of classical and novel computational methods will be employed to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of motor cortical activity during movement initiation. Project Narrative Understanding how the central nervous system initiates voluntary movements of different body parts is a fundamental yet unresolved problem in systems neuroscience. The proposed project will enhance our understanding of the cortical basis of initiation which may have clinical implications for patients that suffer from problems with launching movements due to Parkinson's disease or cortical damage from stroke or injury. This work may also have relevance towards the development of more effective neural prostheses by incorporating spatio-temporal information in decoding algorithms used to control these systems.",Coding of Action by Motor & Premotor Cortical Ensembles,10126931,R01NS111982,"['3-Dimensional', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Etiology', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Imagery', 'Implant', 'Injury', 'Isometric Exercise', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reaction Time', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Travel', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visual', 'Work', 'arm', 'artificial neural network', 'attenuation', 'density', 'grasp', 'kinematics', 'motor behavior', 'neural prosthesis', 'novel', 'orofacial', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot exoskeleton', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,423345
"Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit Abstract The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated, well-timed movements. The cerebellar cortex seems to have a particular role in learning to time movements. Since the 1960's and 70's, we have known the architecture of the cerebellar microcircuit, but most analyses of cerebellar function during behavior have focused on Purkinje cells. Here, we propose to investigate the cerebellar cortex at an entirely new level by asking how the full cerebellar microcircuit – mossy fiber, granule cells, Golgi cells, molecular layer interneurons, and Purkinje cells – performs neural computations during motor behavior and motor learning. We strive to “crack” the circuit by identifying all elements, recording their electrical activity during movement and learning, and reconstructing a neural circuit model that reproduces the biological data. We will use three established learning systems that all can learn predictive timing: classical conditioning of the eyelid response (mice), predictive timing of forelimb movements (mice), and direction learning in smooth pursuit eye movements (monkeys). Our proposal has six key features. First, optogenetics (in mice) will link the discharge of different cerebellar interneurons during movement and learning to their molecular cell types. Second, a machine-learning clustering analysis (in mice and monkeys) will find analogies among the cell populations recorded in our three preparations and will classify neurons according to their putative cell types based on recordings of many parameters of non-Purkinje cells during movement and motor learning. Third, multi- contact electrodes will allow us to record simultaneously from multiple neighboring single neurons and compute spike-timing cross-correlograms (CCGs) to identify the sign of connections; we also will look for changes in CCGs that provide evidence of specific sites of plasticity during learning. Fourth, gCAMP imaging of the granule cell layer will reveal the temporal structure of inputs to the cerebellar microcircuit, and determine whether those inputs are modified in relation to motor learning. Fifth, a model neural network with realistic cerebellar architecture will reveal a single set of model parameters that will transform the measured inputs to the cerebellum in our three movement systems to the measured responses of all neurons in the cerebellar cortex. Sixth, the model will elucidate how mechanisms of synaptic and cellular plasticity at different sites in the cerebellar microcircuit work together to cause motor learning. Project Narrative The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated and well-timed movements. A better understanding of how the cerebellar circuit works and learns will be important for improving human health in cases of stroke, neuro-degenerative motor disease, developmental motor disorders, and adult movement disorders.",Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit,10155611,R01NS112917,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brush Cell', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellum', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Forelimb', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smooth Pursuit', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'commune', 'design', 'experimental study', 'eyeblink conditioning', 'eyelid conditioning', 'granule cell', 'improved', 'learned behavior', 'mossy fiber', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1275271
"Chemogenetic afferent modulation to understand spinal cord circuit function and plasticity post injury PROJECT SUMMARY Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes life-long neurological impairment, and there is currently no effective treatment. The premise of this proposal is recent work demonstrating that afferent stimulation paired with treadmill training can enhance standing, stepping, and volitional control in humans and animal models. Therefore, it is critically important to understand the mechanisms by which afferent stimulation drives motor improvement. Tools that can identify which afferents are necessary and sufficient to enhance recovery, and that can facilitate characterization of the helpful neural plasticity, are urgently needed. Our long-term goal is to develop approaches for selective afferent modulation, and apply them to the dissection of the mechanisms underlying recovery from SCI. The objective of this grant is to identify which sets of afferents are important for recovery and how spinal circuits change to facilitate it. To achieve selective modulation of afferents and enable genetic tracing we will use Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) that can modulate excitability in specific populations of neurons. To accurately quantify improvement, we will use Deep Learning to analyze large kinematic data sets. Our preliminary data shows strong expression of DREADDs in large diameter DRG neurons, that their activation by CNO can excite or inhibit the H-reflex, and that activation of excitatory DREADDs during treadmill training post-SCI improves stepping. Our main hypothesis is that activation of large afferents by the excitatory DREADD (hM3Dq) during treadmill training will enhance recovery, whereas inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di) will suppress recovery. Four sub- hypotheses will test whether recovery is mediated by increased afferent projection onto 1) motor neurons, or 2) inhibitory interneurons; or by sprouting of 3) reticulospinal and 4) propriospinal circuits. Our Specific Aims are to determine whether selective expression of DREADDs in (Aim 1) all large diameter (proprioceptive and tactile) neurons and (Aim 2) large proprioceptive afferents only can enhance recovery. The rationale for these aims is that afferent stimulation is hypothesized to work through selective excitation of large diameter sensory afferents (LDSA) that both drive motor pools locally and facilitate proprio- and surpraspinal input. To date, it has not been possible to definitively determine which afferents were recruited after electrical stimulation, or to select between afferents of similar diameter. The significance of this work lies in determining whether recovery is mediated exclusively by proprioceptive axons or a combination of proprioceptive and tactile afferents, and uncovering the mechanisms of functional plasticity in the spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 300,000 individuals are living with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the USA without an effective treatment. Recently, spinal cord stimulation during rehabilitation has been found to enable better standing, stepping, and voluntary control in patients with SCI. This study will improve our understanding of these mechanisms by 1) using new genetic tools to identify which afferents are necessary and sufficient for improvement, and 2) using genetic tracing techniques to uncover how spinal circuits are changing to enhance function.",Chemogenetic afferent modulation to understand spinal cord circuit function and plasticity post injury,10198063,R01NS114007,"['Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Caliber', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dissection', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'H-Reflex', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Locomotor Recovery', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Outcome', 'Parvalbumins', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Contusions', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Synapses', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toes', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'density', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'effective therapy', 'feeding', 'functional plasticity', 'human model', 'improved', 'injury recovery', 'kinematics', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'sensory input', 'tool', 'treadmill training', 'vector']",NINDS,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,395672
"CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits Despite substantial progress characterizing neural responses, it is particularly challenging to determine  causal interactions within recurrently connected circuits due to the confounding influence of the  interconnections. This proposed project pioneers a nascent field of closed-loop computational neuroscience that enables real-time feedback stimulation during experiments to decouple recurrently connected elements and make stronger causal inferences about their interactions. Specifically, the  contributions of this project will include: Aim 1) Using modern unsupervised machine learning methods to fit latent state dynamical system models of population responses under closed-loop stimulation. The  developed techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in genetically targeted inhibitory interneurons  across S 1 cortical laminae in the mouse to map the causal effect of inhibitory cells on the sensory gain in  excitatory cells. Aim 2) Merging and extending tools from network feedback control and causal inference  to identify functional connections between network nodes using realistic experimental constraints. These  techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in different S1 laminae of the mouse, using distributed  perturbations to identify the functional connectivity between microcircuit layers during sensory stimulation.  Aim 3) Developing a large-scale computational modeling environment to serve as an in si\ico testbed for the community.  Significance: The proposed project changes the de facto standard use of stimulation in experiments to  leverage the full power of new recording and s.timulation technology for decoupling recurrently connected  variables and making stronger causal inferences.  Broader impacts: While the project uses rodent somatosensation as a model system, the results of this  project will provide new techniques to study neurologic disorders involving disfunction of recurrent circuits  (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and depression). The open-source implementations will constitute  critical algorithmic infrastructure for closed-loop stimulation experiments. This project will also result in the  production of new trainees in an emerging new interdisciplinary field of closed-loop computational neuroscience. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The neural circuits that fail in many neurologic disorders (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and  depression) are difficult to study because they involve complex feedback loops. This project will develop  algorithms that combine measurements and stimulation in real-time to provide powerful new tools to  uncover the operating principles of these circuits and change their operation.

"Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces Project Abstract. Candidate and career goals: I am an engineer by training, with a strong background in neural engineering and the development of motor brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). My career goal is to establish an independent nonhuman primate (NHP) laboratory with two primary aims. First, I will advance our fundamental understanding of the motor system via the combination of electrophysiology with novel statistical and computational methods. Second, I will leverage this knowledge to develop frameworks for superior BMI systems.  Throughout my academic and research career I have developed expertise in engineering, computation, and neuroscience with the goal of pursuing these aims. Advances in machine learning, large-scale neural recordings, and deep learning in neural networks are happening quickly (in part via the BRAIN Initiative), and are very promising for the field. Yet very few researchers have the correct combination of skills to make use of them in my areas of interest. In completing the proposed training, I will be uniquely positioned to perform the innovative work necessary to advance our understanding of the planning and execution of cortically controlled movements. I will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in the experimental and computational methods necessary to understand fundamental principles of cortical computations.  Research plan: In this project, I will employ multiple computational approaches to understand the structure of population activity in motor cortex (M1) across multiple kinds of behaviors. I will then use that knowledge to create high performance BMI decoders that will be applicable to a wide range of movements.  Recent empirical observations are changing our view of the structure of M1 activity. During one particular task (e.g., reaching), neural activity may seem to exist within a small space that it explores completely. Yet as more tasks are observed, it becomes clear that activity comprises a highly structured geometry within a much larger space. This means that activity patters for different movements do not come ‘near’ one another or overlap. While counterintuitive, this geometry yields new opportunities. By exploiting the separation of activity patterns, movements can be readily distinguished, even when unfolding simultaneously. I will further explore this geometry across multiple behaviors, both in primates and neural network models, to develop new BMI methods. The specific aims of the plan are to (1) create a high-performance decoder for a novel wheelchair-relevant navigation task, (2) build network models to understand M1 activity structure and identify decoding principles that will generalize across tasks (reaching, navigation), and (3) implement a multitask BMI using a unified decoder that allows animals to both navigate and interact with objects. Career development plan: I will be trained by Dr. Mark Churchland and Dr. Larry Abbott at Columbia University. Project Narrative Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) interpret brain activity to control external devices (computers, prosthetic limbs), and can restore voluntary movement to individuals with limb loss or paralysis. BMIs for reaching and grasping have been demonstrated in human clinical trials, and must now be extended to perform a variety of movements. The proposed work will use advanced computational methods to create an intuitively controllable and high performance BMI system applicable to many natural movements, including locomotion. This work will both develop neurotechnology, and add to our scientific understanding of the computational principles that underlie activity in motor cortex.",Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces,10126071,K99NS115919,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Animals', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biomimetics', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'career development', 'combat', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'limb loss', 'meetings', 'mind control', 'multitask', 'network models', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotechnology', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual world']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2021,136242
"A new mechanistic and technological framework for uncovering the spinal cord neural systems important for functional recovery after injury Project Summary and Abstract Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) are improving, but little is known about the neural systems that would be most effective to target such interventions. Sensory based rehabilitation suggests a strong link between cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory neuron activity and motor recovery. Previous experiments provide strong support for the intermediate zone (IZ) of the spinal cord (SC) as an important site mediating this recovery. However, few studies have assessed the role of specific IZ neurons in functional recovery. Key barriers to progress include lack of characterization of specific cell types within the IZ and a paucity of tools to visualize circuits and test their functions in motor performance and recovery following SCI. Our lab combines sophisticated mouse genetic approaches with sensitive motor movement tracking to understand how sensory information is encoded by the SC to influence behavior. Using this approach, we uncovered that intermediate zone (IZ) parvalbumin positive interneurons (PVs) are important for tactile motor responses and locomotion. We hypothesize that IZ-PVs process sensory information to activate specific muscle groups during locomotion and that they play a critical role in activity-based functional recovery following SCI. The ability to identify circuits important for functional recovery relies on how accurately we can quantify differences in behavioral outcomes. We are implementing an unsupervised approach using 3-D pose dynamics and artificial intelligence (AI) to characterize both sensitive behavioral biomarkers and uncover key spinal cord circuits important for the recovery process. Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration are improving, and this project both identifies the neural systems and synaptic mechanisms that would be most effective to target such interventions and establishes an AI-based platform for fast, reliable and unbiased quantification of motor recovery in rodents. Thus, this project makes original and important contributions to the field of spinal cord research in ways that are specifically aligned with central missions of the NINDS. Moreover, our experimental scrutiny at both the neural and behavioral levels establishes a critical foundation for developing a leading research program and securing independent award funding studying the spinal cord circuits important for sensorimotor function and recovery following SCI. To this end, I have developed a thorough and pragmatic career development plan supported by a strong committee of mentors with extensive track records of laboratory and departmental level mentoring and distinguished portfolios of SCI-specific grant support from the NIH, DoD and private foundations. My career development activities will be focused on four aspects of my academic success. 1) Mentorship and guidance focused on laboratory management. 2) Development and growth of my independent research program and award funding, with a focus on SCI research gap-based training. 3) Navigating institutional responsibilities and fulfilling requirements for promotion and tenure. 4) Expanding my scientific network and profile.

"DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease Abstract Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the most effective treatments for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Delivery of high frequency electrical stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) ameliorates parkinsonian motor symptoms, often within seconds, but therapeutic effects wear off quickly if stimulation is stopped, often within minutes. This transient nature of symptomatic relief underscores the fact that existing DBS protocols mask symptoms but do not alleviate underlying circuit dysfunction. A modified DBS protocol, called coordinated reset (CR-DBS), has shown potential to provide long-lasting therapeutic benefits for days to weeks after stimulation, but this protocol has been slow to translate into widespread clinical use because (1) the multi- site, pseudorandom stimulation patterns required to implement it cannot be delivered with existing devices and (2) its mechanisms of action remain obscure, hindering insights into what parameters of CR-DBS should be tuned to ensure engagement of long-lasting effects. Recently, in a mouse model of PD, we discovered a cellular- based strategy to induce long-lasting motor recovery, by using optogenetics to target interventions to specific neuronal subpopulations in the external globus pallidus (GPe), an anatomical neighbor of the STN. Long-lasting motor rescue was induced by interventions that simultaneously increased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in parvalbumin (PV-GPe) and decreased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in lim homeobox 6 (Lhx6-GPe). Interestingly, at the physiological level, these cell-type specific interventions in the GPe converged upon a similar mechanism as CR-DBS, by ameliorating pathological patterns of neural activity in basal ganglia output nuclei that have been associated with parkinsonian motor deficits. This proposal will use knowledge gained from our discovery of long-lasting rescue through cell-type directed interventions in GPe to guide rational design and interrogation of human-applicable forms of DBS that may yield similarly long-lasting therapeutic benefit. Our experiments will test a novel, mechanistic hypothesis, based on supporting preliminary data, that the pattern of electrical DBS can be tuned to drive cell-type specific responses in the GPe that mirror those previously found to be sufficient to induce of long-lasting motor rescue with optogenetics. Experiments in Aim 1 will investigate the cellular mechanisms through which phasic stimulation in the STN evokes cell-type specific responses in the GPe (Aim 1.1) and use a machine learning approach to identify stimulation protocols that maximize this cell-type specific response (Aim 1.2). Experiments in Aim 2 will test the therapeutic efficacy of phasic stimulation protocols compared to conventional DBS, using behavioral and physiological assays in mouse (Aim 2.1) and primate (Aim 2.2) models of PD. Taken together, these experiments will advance our understanding of the fundamental differences between how conventional vs. phasic stimulation impacts the nervous system, with cell-type specific and synapse-specific resolution, and could provide novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly translated into humans. Project Narrative Conventional DBS is an effective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), but its therapeutic effects decay rapidly once stimulation is turned off, underscoring the fact that it masks symptoms but does not reverse underlying circuit dysfunction. Based on foundational research into the cell-type organization of basal ganglia circuits, this proposal develops and tests the therapeutic efficacy of electrical stimulation protocols designed to selectively recruit therapeutic cell populations within the external globus pallidus (GPe) of the basal ganglia. The collaborative project will test the efficacy and therapeutic duration of novel stimulation protocols in mouse and primate models of PD.",DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease,10145825,R01NS117058,"['Acute', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Homeobox', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Oxidopamine', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'STN stimulation', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Solid', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'motor deficit', 'motor recovery', 'motor symptom', 'mouse model', 'neural patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'response', 'side effect', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'translation to humans']",NINDS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,628368
"A computational approach for quantifying motor behaviors in spinocerebellar ataxias to improve early detection of motor signs and precisely estimate disease severity and disease change ABSTRACT  The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that impact a range of human behaviors including arm function, speech, and vision. Tools that can quantify motor deficits in a granular and objective manner are needed to support early recognition of clinical disease onset, more sensitively determine efficacy of a therapy, and make personalized predictions about disease progression. Such tools are needed for upcoming disease modifying clinical trials in SCAs, in order to reduce sample size and trial duration and better understand how a given therapy modifies human behaviors. Powered off of the currently available primary outcome measures for these rare ataxias, clinical trials are likely to face patient recruitment and retention challenges, especially with multiple co-occurring clinical trials. These challenges may impede or slow our ability to successfully discover therapies for our patients.  We have recently made substantial progress in capturing multimodal behavioral signals from speech, eye movement, and arm motor function using everyday technologies: a microphone, iPhone camera, and computer mouse. Our initial data indicate that these scalable technologies have strong potential to extend current clinical assessments in ataxia and that our novel machine learning approach for generating disease severity estimates performs better than the traditional regression model approach. Our algorithms are able to quantitatively identify signs of ataxia and parkinsonism in SCA individuals' speech and arm movement, even when absent on clinical assessment. Furthermore, our novel severity estimation algorithm enabled measurement of disease progression more sensitively than clinical scales. We propose to substantially expand longitudinal data collection and further develop our novel analytic approaches to train more powerful models for characterizing and quantifying human motor behavior. The technologies developed have the potential to facilitate clinical trials aimed at bringing disease modifying therapies to individuals with SCA. While the focus of this project is on SCA, the novel methodological approaches and data generated are applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases affecting movement and speech. Furthermore, this project will bring new insight into how motor abnormalities initially arise and progress.  The overall goal of this project is to develop widely available systems for improving early detection of clinical disease onset, severity assessment, and prognostication of spinocerebellar ataxias while simultaneously learning how these disorders impact fine-grained motor behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There are currently no disease modifying therapies for the spinocerebellar ataxias. One important barrier for development of new therapies for spinocerebellar ataxia and other neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of tools to objectively and sensitively measure a beneficial clinical response to a drug. This project aims to develop systems based on everyday technologies and sophisticated computational methods to provide accessible tools for early detection, precise severity measurement, and prediction of disease progression in spinocerebellar ataxias.",A computational approach for quantifying motor behaviors in spinocerebellar ataxias to improve early detection of motor signs and precisely estimate disease severity and disease change,10210639,R01NS117826,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Ataxia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Home', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning Disorders', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Sample Size', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Speech', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trinucleotide Repeats', 'Vision', 'arm', 'arm function', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'illness length', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'microphone', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oculomotor', 'open source', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,555308
"Acute Modulation of Stereotyped High Frequency Oscillations with a Closed-Loop Brain Interchange System in Drug Resistant Epilepsy Project Summary: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) of intracranial EEG (iEEG) have the potential to identify the surgical resection area/seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with drug resistant epilepsy. However, multiple reports indicate that HFOs can be generated not only by epileptic cerebral tissue but also by non-epileptic sites often including eloquent regions such as motor, visual and language cortices. In this project, we present the initial evidence of a recurrent waveform pattern that may be sufficient to distinguish pathological HFOs from physiological ones. Specifically, we show that the SOZ repeatedly generates sets of stereotypical HFOs with similar waveform morphology whereas the events recorded from out of SOZ were irregular. This morphological pattern served as a robust neurobiomarker to isolate SOZ from other brain areas in multiple patients consistently. While these promising preliminary results are in place, the functional utility of stereotyped HFOs in a closed-loop seizure control system remains unknown. As of today, not much is known whether the stereotyped HFOs generated by the SOZ can be detected with an implantable system. If this can be achieved, then HFOs can be strategically translated as a neurobiomarker into closed-loop seizure control applications. We hypothesize that pathologic stereotyped HFOs can be captured with the implantable Brain Interchange (BIC) system of CorTec and spatial topography of these events can be utilized by the implantable system to deliver targeted electrical stimulation to achieve seizure control. Using an acute setup within the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), this project will investigate the feasibility of capturing stereotyped HFO events using the new BIC system and compare the detection results to those obtained with the commercially available amplifier. If the first phase (Aim-1) of our study becomes successful, later in the second phase (Aim-2), once again in the EMU, we will deliver targeted electrical stimulation to those brain sites associated with stereotyped HFOs using the BIC. We will investigate the modulatory effects of this closed-loop stimulation strategy by monitoring the changes in signature events such as spikes, epileptic discharges, ripples and fast ripples. If successful, this closed-loop system does not have to wait for a seizure to start in order to deliver the stimulation at its onset as done by the RNS system of Neuropace. In contrast, the system will monitor the spatial topography and rate of stereotyped HFOs and deliver targeted stimulation to these areas to prevent seizures from occurring. If the outcomes of our research in acute setting become successful, we will execute a clinical trial and run our methods with the implanted BIC system in a chronic ambulatory setting. 1 Project Narrative Overall, this proposal will investigate the functional utility of stereotyped HFOs by capturing them with a new implantable system (Brain Interchange - BIC of CorTec), which can sample neural data at higher rates >=1kHz and deliver targeted electrical stimulation to achieve seizure control. In contrast to current closed-loop systems (RNS), which wait for the seizure to start before delivering stimulation, the BIC system will monitor the spatial topography and rate of stereotyped HFOs and deliver targeted stimulation to these HFO generating areas to prevent seizures from occurring. If the outcomes of our research in acute setting become successful, we will execute a clinical trial and run our methods with the implantable BIC system in a chronic ambulatory setting. 1",Acute Modulation of Stereotyped High Frequency Oscillations with a Closed-Loop Brain Interchange System in Drug Resistant Epilepsy,10290984,UH3NS117944,"['Acute', 'Amplifiers', 'Area', 'Austria', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural implant', 'neurotechnology', 'neurotransmission', 'open source', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'time use', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,UH3,2021,850000
"Clinical trial readiness in X-linked dystonia parkinsonism: assessment of sensor-based and blood biomarkers for early detection and monitoring disease progression PROJECT SUMMARY Parkinsonism, the second most common movement disorder, affects over 900,000 Americans and its prevalence is rising, while dystonia, the third most common, afflicts 250,000 Americans. X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is a rare neurogenetic movement disorder with a wide phenotypic spectrum ranging from a parkinsonism indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease (PD), generalized dystonia, similar to DYT1 (a hereditary dystonia), or combined dystonia and parkinsonism. Female XDP carriers are at risk for parkinsonism, given X-inactivation and represents a possible genetic risk factor. As such, XDP serves as an excellent model of both dystonia and parkinsonism, and insights can inform both phenotypes and mixed movement disorders, which are notoriously challenging to assess. To provide adequate clinical trial endpoints, rater-independent, quantitative assessments of motor function are urgently needed to identify early abnormalities which may predate overt clinical symptoms and track disease progression, given the unreliability of rater-dependent clinical rating scales. This project will provide Dr. Stephen with a skill set that will allow him to assess potential quantitative measures of disease severity and progression in dystonia and parkinsonism using motion sensors and compare these measures with proposed biochemical biomarkers, using machine learning to define optimal parameters. This project aims to address three key knowledge gaps in dystonia and parkinsonism, using pure phenotypes (DYT1 and PD) and in combination (XDP): Aim 1) to utilize technology-based evaluations as more sensitive and accurate measures of dystonia in isolation (DYT1) vs. in combination with parkinsonism (XDP) compared to clinical scales; Aim 2) to examine the accuracy of sensor-based monitoring of disease progression over 1 year in XDP, PD and DYT1 patients; and Aim 3) to analyze 2 proposed blood biomarkers (one specific to XDP, and neurofilament light chain, a general marker of neurodegeneration) in XDP and combine these motor and blood markers, using machine learning to predict disease phenotype/biotype and clinical course. This research complements the NINDS objective of clinical trial readiness in rare neurological disorders, with a wider goal of better understanding these common phenotypes in the context of a mixed movement disorder, using innovative technology and analysis methods. The goal of this award is to prepare the candidate to become a fully independent investigator in the quantitative assessment of dystonia, parkinsonism and other movement disorders, in the setting of expert mentorship. The career development plan includes training goals: 1) learning transferrable motion analysis skills, 2) learning machine learning techniques to develop predictive models of motor behaviors and combining these with blood biomarker data; and 3) an introduction to biomarker science and bioinformatics. Successful completion of this project will put Dr. Stephen in a unique position to inform clinical trial readiness efforts in XDP, relevant to other dystonia and to prepare for submission of a competitive R01 application focusing on quantitative movement analysis and biofluid markers in genetic dystonia, parkinsonism and mixed movement disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Parkinsonism is the second most common movement disorder in the U.S, affecting over 900,000 Americans (projected to reach greater than 1.2 million by 2030) and dystonia (involving the development of abnormal posturing and uncomfortable twisting) is the third most common, afflicting more than 250,000 Americans: both disorders are a considerable source of morbidity and disability. X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP), a rare neurogenetic movement disorder has a combination of both generalized dystonia and parkinsonism, with a wide phenotypic spectrum and may represent an independent genetic risk factor for the development of parkinsonism in female heterozygous carriers, such that studying XDP, while comparing to both disorders in isolation (DYT1, another hereditary dystonia, and Parkinson's disease, the archetypal parkinsonism) will inform both of these phenotypes, as well as the understanding and assessment of mixed movement disorders. This project will provide important contributions to the literature by providing: 1) new ways to quantify the neurological examination, which could identify rater-independent relevant clinical trial endpoints; and 2) potential motor and proposed blood markers, which, using machine learning, may be more accurate in combination, as a method to detect early disease, track progression and predict disease course, which will benefit not only XDP but other conditions with both of these motor phenotypes and neurogenetic disorders.",Clinical trial readiness in X-linked dystonia parkinsonism: assessment of sensor-based and blood biomarkers for early detection and monitoring disease progression,10302039,K23NS118045,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dystonia', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Filipino', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Dystonia', 'Inherited', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minisatellite Repeats', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural History', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philippines', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Prevalence', 'Psychological Transfer', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'TAF1 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'X Inactivation', 'X-linked dystonia parkinsonism', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'career development', 'clinical trial readiness', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'genetic risk factor', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular marker', 'motion sensor', 'motor behavior', 'movement analysis', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurofilament', 'neurogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'sensor', 'skills', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,197640
"Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move Project Summary/Abstract A central challenge in neuroscience biomedical research is to define the neural circuits that underlie behavior. Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington’s pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin (i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both corrective movements during locomotion and motor ‘switching’ during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches, high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to cutaneous input. Aim 3 combines joint and muscle activity recordings to test the hypothesis that this network shapes cutaneous responses to facilitate corrective movements during locomotion. We extend these behavioral studies by implementing computer vision and machine learning to parse out naturalistic behaviors into sub- second movements to test the hypothesis that touch-specific premotor networks sculpt how micro-movements are pieced together into complex motor behaviors . By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research will lead to new therapies aimed at improving the quality of life of people suffering from a variety of neurological disorders. Thus, this research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function.

"Spinal Neurons that shape the way we move: diversity supplement for Ms. Gonzalez Project Summary/Abstract A central challenge in neuroscience biomedical research is to define the neural circuits that underlie behavior. Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington’s pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin (i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both corrective movements during locomotion and motor ‘switching’ during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches, high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to cutaneous input.

"Interpretable machine learning for understanding the neural control of movement Modern machine learning can fit complex models that make accurate predictions. However, understanding the brain with standard machine learning is a great challenge. A critical impediment is that it is often difficult to understand the inner workings of these models. There is thus a great need for more interpretable machine learning methods for neuroscience, in which the inner workings of the model relate to neural structure or function. The proposed research will develop interpretable machine learning methods for studying the neural control of movement. Through close collaboration with the experimental lab of Dr. Churchland, these methods will be applied to answer three central questions in motor control. In the first two aims, the research investigates how flexibly spinal motor neurons can be controlled, and how activity in motor cortex controls muscle activity across a wide range of movements. Beyond increasing scientific knowledge, answering these two questions could enhance brain computer interfaces for restoring control to those with motor impairments. In the third aim, the research investigates how multiple neural populations interact with each other to plan and generate movement. This question is relevant to many neurological disorders, in which communication between brain areas is disrupted. During the K99 phase of this award, occurring within Columbia’s vibrant neuroscience community, the applicant will receive additional training in computational techniques from Drs. Paninski and Cunningham, and additional experimental training from Dr. Churchland. This training will provide the necessary experience for the applicant to be successful in this work and to successfully start an independent lab at the interface of machine learning and the neural control of movement. While the development of many new neural recording technologies has led to much excitement, it has created a huge gap between our ability to collect data and our ability to deeply understand it. More interpretable machine learning tools are necessary for understanding neural function in health and neurological disease, to one day develop curative interventions. The goal of this research is to develop interpretable machine learning models and apply them to understand how brain areas interact with each other and how they control muscle activity during a wide range of movements.",Interpretable machine learning for understanding the neural control of movement,10106091,K99NS119787,"['Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Intramuscular', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Side', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'cortex mapping', 'curative treatments', 'data structure', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,K99,2021,125442
"Uncovering the neurophysiology of motivation in ParkinsonÃÂs disease with implanted adaptive brain stimulation TITLE: UNCOVERING THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGY OF MOTIVATION IN PARKINSON’S DISEASE WITH IMPLANTED ADAPTIVE BRAIN STIMULATION PROJECT SUMMARY Behavioral symptoms such as apathy and impulsivity represent a prevalent, highly-disabling feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and many other neurological conditions, for which treatments are currently very limited. The long-term goal of this award is to understand the neurocircuitry of motivation in order to develop precise and personalized therapies for motor and non-motor symptoms in neurological disorders. The overall objective is to establish the neural structures and signals that underpin motivation in PD. My central hypothesis is that the human motivation system comprises two functionally distinct frontal cortex - basal ganglia (FC- BG) circuits that drive behavior: 1) the prefrontal - basal ganglia circuit evaluates rewards and operates in the theta (3-7Hz) frequency range and 2) the premotor - basal ganglia circuit evaluates action costs, and is mediated by beta (13-30Hz) frequency signals, with both modulated by dopamine. Therefore, the rationale of the project is that understanding the neural structures and signals of the FC-BG reward circuit is critical for the development of effective stimulation therapies for behavioral symptoms in PD. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two Specific Aims: Aim 1) Identify the neurophysiological signatures of reward cost-benefit evaluation in PD. Patients with chronically implanted, sensing-enabled brain stimulators will perform reward cost-benefit evaluation tasks with simultaneous FC-BG recordings, on and off dopamine medication. Additionally, patients will trigger recordings of neural signals at home, with paired self-reports of apathy and impulsivity. Aim 2) Evaluate the causal relationship of frontal cortex-basal ganglia structures & signals to behavior. Spatio-temporally targeted brain stimulation will be delivered to the FC-BG network during reward cost-benefit evaluation to test the causal role of these structures and signals to motivated behavior. The research is innovative because it uses a) chronic invasive brain recordings, in patients, during behavioral tasks that index motivation, b) recordings at home to determine within-subject reproducibility and link to naturalistic motivational states and c) causal interventions to demonstrate mechanistic relationships. It is significant because determining an accurate understanding of the neurocircuitry of reward will enable the future development of precise, spatio-temporally targeted adaptive brain stimulation for apathy and impulsivity in PD, a major unmet need. As such, Dr. Little has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring group led by Prof. Philip Starr and supported by advisors Profs. Edward Chang, Wendy Mendes and Joshua Berke to develop a comprehensive structured training plan involving 1) cognitive-affective neuroscience 2) electrocorticography 3) machine learning and 4) trial design and statistics. This award will propel Dr. Little towards independence and expertise in the investigation of the neurophysiology, and treatment, of motor and non-motor neurological symptoms. It will also provide the foundation for a future R01 application investigating the relationship between clinical apathy, impulsivity and neurophysiology in a wide cohort of neurological patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Personalized, adaptive, brain stimulation has the potential to benefit disabling behavioral symptoms such as apathy and impulsivity across a wide range of neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, but is currently limited by a lack of understanding of how the brain assesses rewards to drive actions. The goal of this project is to determine how rewards are evaluated across the frontal cortex - basal ganglia circuits and to evaluate the mechanistic role of the structures and signals of this network in Parkinson’s disease. This foundational understanding will direct future stimulation therapies to reduce the burden of apathy and impulsivity in Parkinson’s disease and other neurological disorders in a precise and principled manner.",Uncovering the neurophysiology of motivation in ParkinsonÃÂs disease with implanted adaptive brain stimulation,10106490,K23NS120037,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Craniocerebral Trauma', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Ganglia', 'Goals', 'Home', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Implant', 'Impulsivity', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self Assessment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'addiction', 'affective neuroscience', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'motivated behavior', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'non-motor symptom', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward circuitry', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trial design']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,200478
"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) enhances motor learning through temporally-precise cholinergic neuromodulation Project Summary/Abstract Neurological injuries, including those from stroke and TBI, are highly prevalent in the US with millions of cases reported annually and often result in lasting debilitation. Recent studies have found that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), which involves electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve with an implanted electrode, may to facilitate motor rehabilitation from neurological injury through mechanisms of enhanced plasticity. However, little is known about mechanisms that underly VNS-driven plasticity and motor learning. Previous reports have shown that motor cortex neural activity is altered during motor learning and that lesion of cholinergic systems can prevent motor learning and VNS-enhanced cortical map plasticity. But how VNS modulates motor circuits, and the role cholinergic signaling plays in mediating VNS effects remains poorly studied. This work aims to understand the neural mechanism that underly VNS-enhanced plasticity and motor learning. To address this gap in knowledge, I am proposing to manipulate learning of a skilled reach task with VNS and optogenetic cholinergic manipulation. Using recent advancements in deep learning algorithms I will record 3D reach trajectory to quantify the behavioral impact VNS and cholinergic manipulation have on skilled reaching. I also propose to chronically implanted in vivo optetrode arrays to record single-unit neural activity from the BF to determine if VNS alters BF activity directly. Lastly, I propose use cell-type specific calcium imaging in the motor cortex, to determine if VNS activates cortical inhibitory microcircuits.  Project Narrative Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is being studied in phase 3 clinical trials as a potential therapy for stroke rehabilitation, but little is known about underlying circuits utilized by VNS to enhance rehabilitation. This project will use novel approaches in optogenetics and neurophysiology to determine how VNS alters motor cortex circuits and cholinergic signaling to drive motor learning enhancement An increased understanding of the underlying circuits and temporal dynamics of VNS will be critical to optimize the technique for therapeutic use.",Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) enhances motor learning through temporally-precise cholinergic neuromodulation,10313783,F31NS120739,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acetylcholine', 'Address', 'Annual Reports', 'Behavioral', 'Calcium', 'Case Study', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dissection', 'Economic Burden', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Work', 'basal forebrain', 'cell type', 'cholinergic', 'cholinergic neuron', 'clinically relevant', 'cortex mapping', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'extracellular', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'stroke patient', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke therapy', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool', 'vagus nerve stimulation']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,F31,2021,34288
"An Open Source Simulator for Multi Degree-Of-Freedom Brain-Machine Interfaces PROJECT SUMMARY For millions with movement disorders including paralysis and ALS, intracortical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are an emerging technology that aims to restore lost motor function and communication. The main component of a BMI is a decoder algorithm that translates neural activity from motor areas of the brain into the kinematics of a prosthetic device. Due to the complexity of these systems, which includes the BMI user interacting with the decoded kinematics in a closed-feedback loop, current technology requires expensive and invasive experiments to design, optimize, and validate decoder algorithms. The need for such experiments (1) results in slow develop- ment and evaluation of decoder algorithms, and (2) limits the scope of people who can work on these problems to a small group of nonhuman primate and clinical trial labs. As a consequence, BMIs have remained in pilot clinical trials since their ﬁrst reported demonstration in 2004. We propose a new open-source simulator for multiple degree-of-freedom (DOF) BMI systems. The goals of this simulator are to (1) reduce the time it takes to evaluate and optimize BMI algorithms from months to minutes, and (2) signiﬁcantly expand the community of researchers who develop testable algorithms for BMIs. To build the simulator, we propose neural encoding models that generate synthetic motor cortical activity for multiple DOF tasks. This is possible because neural population activity is relatively low-dimensional and has dynamics, which can be learned via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We build our neural simulators using data collected from human clinical trials during point-to-point multi-DOF reaches. We also propose to develop new models of human controllers. This solves an important problem in BMIs: users learn new control strategies when controlling a particular BMI decoder algorithm. Our simulator uses deep imitation and reinforcement learning to solve this problem. It is constrained through imitation learning to perform actions like a human. It is optimized through reinforcement learning to explore new strategies – under the constraint of being human-like – to optimally control the BMI. Together, we expect these innovations will result in a purely software simulator that accurately predicts BMI performance and enables design and optimization. This tool will be open-sourced and available to all, enabling widespread development of BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE For people who have lost the ability to move due to movement disorders, including paralysis and ALS, intracor- tical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to restore movement and communication by directly decoding neural activity from motor regions of the brain. We propose to accelerate and democratize BMI research by building a computational simulator, implemented entirely in software, that enables researchers around the world to design and optimize BMI decoder algorithms. We expect this tool will reduce BMI evaluation time from months to min- utes, and by being widely available and open source to all, considerably increase the intracortical BMI research community.",An Open Source Simulator for Multi Degree-Of-Freedom Brain-Machine Interfaces,10183995,R01NS121097,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosciences', 'Paralysed', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'mind control', 'neurosurgery', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'open source', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,394812
"Mapping neural ensemble computations to biological circuitry in motor control and decision making - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary/Abstract Movement is the primary way in which animals interact with the world. To produce the incredibly adaptable behavior of mammals the brain must continually choose actions, then flexibly generate control signals for the body. The main objective of this project is to understand how ensembles of neurons and brain areas work together to control movement and make simple decisions. To understand how behavior is generated, we must know: How is a high-level decision (e.g., reach left vs. right) transformed into a time-varying command signal? And, how does this transformation and the generation of complex outputs exploit the precise biology of neural tissue to function reliably, despite the inherent noisiness of neurons? This goal is critical not only to better understand how neural tissue implements challenging computations, but also because deeper knowledge of these processes is likely to improve treatments for motor disorders such as Parkinson’s and disorders heavily affecting neural connections such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. To achieve this aim, we pair the power of experimental tools in mice together with dynamical systems analysis, which provides mathematical tools for investigating the function of neural ensembles. In the monkey, the dynamical systems approach has led to many insights. For example, we have learned that activity in motor cortex unfolds over time according to oscillatory dynamical “rules”; that much of motor cortical activity exists to support these dynamical rules and does not influence movement directly; and that there is a separation between signals for what movement will be made and when it will be initiated. In the mouse, we propose taking this approach several steps further by mapping the dynamical rules to specific biological features, such as cortical layers and projection pathways. In Aim 1, we will use two-photon calcium imaging to record neural activity during a simple reaching task that elicits variable movements from the mouse. We will then exploit this variability with our dynamical systems tools to identify the rules that govern the M1 pattern generator, and uncover how these rules map to cortical layers. In Aim 2, we will determine how information processing is divided into stages as signals are passed from visual decision areas to motor areas. This second Aim will employ a more complex visually-guided joystick task, together with optogenetic inhibition of specific pathways, calcium imaging, and retrograde tracing. This will allow us to compare activity in the neurons that connect areas with those that are engaged only in local processing. Finally, in Aim 3, we will record from identified projection neurons and apply powerful new machine learning techniques to test two competing theories of how the brain produces consistent outputs: whether the brain suppresses neural “noise” in the output neurons themselves, or suppresses only task-relevant noise according to a more population- oriented approach. These findings will advance our understanding of sophisticated cortical processes including decision making and motor control by grounding theoretical ideas about neural computation in our biological understanding of the tissue that implements it. Project Narrative This study will greatly advance our fundamental understanding of how the brain controls movement and how brain areas interact to make simple choices. Uncovering the principles of operation in the motor system is likely to inform treatments for motor disorders such as Parkinson’s and enable better brain-machine interfaces for use by paralyzed patients. Understanding how brain areas communicate is vital for advancing treatment for stroke and traumatic brain injury, which often disrupt these connections.",Mapping neural ensemble computations to biological circuitry in motor control and decision making - Resubmission - 1,10297601,R01NS121535,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Categories', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Joystick', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'brain machine interface', 'cell type', 'dynamic system', 'fighting', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information processing', 'insight', 'mind control', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'stroke therapy', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual motor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,391599
"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,10207620,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cervical', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Distal', 'Duodenum', 'Eating', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Emetics', 'Emetine', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Ferrets', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Gastric Bypass', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Gastrointestinal Physiology', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hearing', 'Heart Rate', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Rat', 'Laboratory mice', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Satiation', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Vomiting', 'awake', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'cardiovascular effects', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gastric fundus', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'healthy weight', 'heart rate variability', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,482164
"CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations Throughout the brain, specialized systems carry out different but complementary functions, sometimes  independently but often in cooperation. However, we do not understand how their activity is dynamically  coordinated, and dysregulation of this is associated with many mental health conditions. Neuronal oscillations, which are detectable in local field potentials (LFPs) at various frequencies, are a promising  target for this coordination. Gamma oscillations (40-100 Hz) in particular have been singled out since they enhance stimulus responses, facilitate interactions between brain regions, and are expressed ubiquitously across cortical and subcortical regions. Indeed, gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral  nucleus of the amygdala (BL), an important regulator of emotional behaviors. BL gamma oscillations are  enhanced during periods of heightened vigilance during a foraging task, following emotionally salient experiences, and upon presentation of socially-relevant stimuli. The variety of circumstances that engage  it make it a promising target for interventions affecting emotional behaviors in general. However, technical challenges abound because gamma manifests as brief intermittent oscillatory bursts, layered atop numerous ongoing activities in other frequency bands. This precludes manipulating gamma exclusively with traditional pharmacological, optogenetic, or chemogenetic approaches, since these have substantial  effects on ongoing non-gamma activities, and are delivered irrespective of whether gamma bursts are present or absent. To overcome this, a closed-loop algorithm was developed that monitors the LFP in  real-time for gamma oscillations and delivers precisely timed optogenetic stimulation capable of enhancing or suppressing gamma strength on a cycle-by-cycle basis. While this improves upon the status  quo,, further refinement is needed. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to clarify how the gamma modulation technique operates via biophysically detailed modeling of the local circuits in the BL that generate gamma, the effects of optogenetic stimulation, and the closed-loop algorithm. Aim 2 designs better signal  processing routines for detecting and parameterizing gamma in real-time. Aim 3 develops an approach to  create customized biophysical models that reproduce the properties of gamma observed in individual  subjects, which when combined with the results of Aims 1 and 2 should allow for optimized control over gamma oscillations in individual subjects. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region implicated in emotional regulation.  By developing improved methods to manipulate these oscillations, we hope to better understand their  function and improve our ability to control emotional states and behaviors. n/a",CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations,10207403,R01MH122023,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Emotional', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rodent Model', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'biophysical model', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional behavior', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'vigilance']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2021,284005
"Circuit-based deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease The overall goal of the University of Minnesota (UMN) Udall Center is to develop novel, circuit based deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies for Parkinson’s disease (PD) based on an understanding of the changes in pathophysiological activity patterns that occur in basal ganglia thalamocortical-brainstem (BGTC-B) pathways. Project 1 (human) will characterize the role of oscillatory activity, coupling and connectivity across the broader BGTC network, including the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus internus (GPi), sensory, motor, premotor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. These recordings will be performed at rest and during cognitive- motor tasks, with and without therapeutic interventions (DBS, L-dopa, DBS+L-dopa). It will also clarify the relative effect of stimulation in different functional subregions of the STN and GPi on motor and cognitive function. Project 2 (human) will explore the mechanisms and effects of pallidal DBS on levodopa resistant motor signs using MRI-derived computational models and fMRI to examine the pathways mediating these changes. It will use new sensing technology (Percept) to identify and correlate the physiological changes in the GP to worsening of, or improvement in, gait dysfunction. Project 3 (non-human primate) will examine the electrophysiological changes in pallido↔peduncular, pallido→intralaminar, and pallido→habenular activity that are related to cognitive-motor symptoms providing further network-level insights into cognitive motor gait impairments, task shifting difficulties, and loss of motivation, which will complement the results from the human studies in Projects 1 and 2. All center components have synergistic interactions with the Catalyst Project, which will support research efforts of a promising Early Stage Investigator who will use a novel closed-loop DBS approach to probe circuit dynamics in PD patients and their relationship to PD motor signs. The Imaging Core will acquire state- of-the-art, high-field structural MRI as well as rest and task-based fMRI for PD patients in Projects 1 and 2 (using 7T scanner) and structural MRI for the NHPs in Project 3 (using the first of its kind 10.5T scanner).The Clinical Core will obtain clinical and quantitative motor and neuropsychological assessments that will be correlated to physiological data obtained acutely in the operating room, subacutely in patients with externalized DBS leads and electrocorticography arrays, and chronically through postoperative recordings using Percept. The Biostatistics Core will provide overall data management, quality control, statistical and machine learning analysis and data entry into the NINDS Data Management Resource. The Administrative Core will orchestrate all aspects of the UMN Udall Center, implement and support patient education and public outreach efforts, and develop and monitor individualized career enhancement plans for the next generation of PD researchers. Together, these approaches will provide critical data towards the development and translation of novel patient- specific DBS therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Overall) The overall goal of the UMN Udall Center is to define the changes in brain circuitry that underlie motor and cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease and use this information to improve current and develop new deep brain stimulation therapeutic approaches.

"Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks We propose to develop an implantable brain stimulation system to measure and control oscillatory local field potential (LFP) synchrony within brain networks. Implantable neurotechnologies like deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders and epilepsy. DBS has some clinical signal in psychiatry as well, but individual trial results are highly variable. We have argued that this is a target engagement problem – that the high-frequency constant stimulation used in Parkinson’s or other tremor disorders is not the right approach to the circuits of mental illness. Instead, we believe the correct approach is to identify signatures of healthy communication in these circuits/networks, then design stimulation protocols that specifically produce those signatures. LFP synchrony is likely one of those communication signatures. Across multiple domains of cognitive and emotional function, behavioral performance (a read-out of successful network communication) improves when brain regions show synchronous (coherent) LFP oscillations. Further, clinically effective DBS, in movement and psychiatric disorders, is associated with changes in LFP synchrony. Co-PI Widge has developed algorithms that specifically control inter-regional LFP synchrony, by locking electrical stimulation pulses in one region to the phase of an ongoing oscillation in another region. The translational challenge is that efficient, implantable real-time synchrony monitoring and phase-locked stimulation require signal processing capabilities not found in any existing or anticipated device. Co-PI Shoaran has developed power-efficient phase estimation circuits, specifically optimized for DBS- like implants. We propose to combine these approaches. Aims 1 and 2 will develop a new application- specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that integrates Dr. Shoaran’s measurement and neural decoding frameworks with Dr. Widge’s oscillation-control methods. We will validate this circuit’s recording and phase-locking capabilities in vivo in Dr. Widge’s rodent lab. In Aim 3, a world-leading contract implant manufacturer (Cirtec) will integrate that new ASIC into a packaged, implant-ready device ready for large animal safety testing. Cirtec has already developed a DBS prototyping platform optimized to get new therapies more quickly into first-in- human, allowing us to greatly accelerate the path to the clinic and reduce regulatory risk. At the end of 5 years, we will either be ready for that clinical pilot or have only modest safety testing remaining. Our team has expertise in electronics, medical device fabrication, clinical brain stimulation, and technology commercialization. The work will be headquartered in Minnesota’s “Medical Alley”, an epicenter of medical device innovation. We are well-qualified to execute these Aims and bring the resulting technology to market. Success would yield a new implant optimized for network monitoring and therapy, a powerful new tool for both psychiatric treatment and cutting-edge neuroscience research. Project Narrative We will develop a new implantable medical device for treating severe psychiatric illness, especially mood and anxiety disorders. Many, if not all, of these disorders arise from communication failure in distributed brain networks, networks that communicate through rhythmic, oscillatory firing of large groups of brain cells. Our device will implement new algorithms that measure and control that rhythmic firing, restoring patterns of healthy communication.",Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks,10227769,R01MH123634,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Testing', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electronics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufactured form', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tremor', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analog', 'animal safety', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'commercialization', 'conditioning', 'design', 'digital', 'emotional functioning', 'first-in-human', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'nanofabrication', 'neural circuit', 'neurotechnology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychiatric symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'safety testing', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trigonometry']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,871272
"Model-based neural control of brain stimulation for neuropsychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide, with depressive disorders being the most disabling among them. Many patients are resistant to all current treatments. Invasive electrical brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression showed early promise in open-label studies but has had variable efficacy in controlled clinical trials. To date, stimulation in neuropsychiatric disorders has been limited to an open-loop approach that applies a fixed pattern of continuous stimulation regardless of symptom levels. One limitation is that open-loop stimulation does not track the inter- and intra-subject variabilities in neuropsychiatric symptoms, which can change rapidly in an individual. Another limitation is the lack of an input-output model that can guide stimulation by predicting how ongoing stimulation input drives large-scale neural activity and the symptoms it underlies in an individual. We will address these limitations to enable precise invasive electrical brain stimulation for neuropsychiatric disorders by developing a novel real-time model-based neural control system. We will provide proof-of-concept demonstration for acute control of neural biomarkers of mood states related to depression symptoms in epilepsy patients with implanted intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) electrodes, in whom we will obtain repeated mood self-reports and perform stimulation simultaneously with neural recording. The system will continuously adjust the stimulation parameters, for the first time, based on 2 elements: (i) Novel personalized input-output model learned on recorded brain network response while delivering a new stochastic stimulation waveform to excite network activity. (ii) Personalized decoder trained on multi-day continuous iEEG recordings and simultaneous mood self-reports to estimate mood state variations from neural activity as feedback. Combining these, we will build a real-time model-based closed-loop system to precisely drive the neurally-decoded mood state—the neural biomarker of mood—to a target level. Our system generalizes to any stimulation site. Here, we will demonstrate the system with orbitofrontal stimulation as we have shown it to acutely improve mood and modulate large-scale mood-relevant brain activity. We will run real-time closed-loop experiments in each patient. The system will estimate the neural biomarker from iEEG and adjust the stimulation amplitude and frequency in real-time based on the input-output model to drive the estimated biomarker to a target level. We will also develop model-free closed-loop on-off stimulation that turns stimulation on-off based on the neural biomarker. We will compare model-based, on-off and open-loop stimulations. Success of this program will enable precisely regulating a desired brain state by developing the first model-based closed- loop invasive brain stimulation system and advancing neuromodulation technology. It will also directly inform electrical stimulation therapy in future pivotal clinical trials of refractory depression. The developed system and gained knowledge will generalize across many neuropsychiatric disorders with broad public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Direct electrical stimulation of the brain holds promise for patients with refractory neuropsychiatric conditions and in particular treatment-resistant depression but has been limited to delivering a fixed stimulation pattern and shown variable efficacy in clinical trials. We propose that one way to improve efficacy is to build a novel model- based system that adjusts the stimulation based on recording brain signals that are related to mood symptoms and modeling how ongoing stimulation changes these signals. We will develop this novel model-based system to enable personalized real-time stimulation and test it for acute control of neural biomarkers of mood states related to depression symptoms in human epilepsy patients.",Model-based neural control of brain stimulation for neuropsychiatric disorders,10209839,R01MH123770,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Trials', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Dissociation', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electric Stimulation Therapy', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Refractory', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'comorbid depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'mind control', 'mood symptom', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'open label', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time model', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,626990
"Real-time visualization and precision targeting in transcranial magnetic stimulation Project Summary Title: Real-time visualization and precision targeting in transcranial magnetic stimulation Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive device-based neuromodulation technique for probing neuronal networks and treating mental disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The treatment efficacy of TMS relies on placing TMS coils to accurately stimulate the underlying disease-related brain target. Since TMS-evoked electric field (E-field) is affected by complex tissue structures and brain geometry, it relies on using computational algorithms, such as boundary element modeling (BEM) and finite element modeling (FEM), to estimate the stimulation site. But the relative long computation time of these methods is a limitation for real-time visualization of the stimulation target during brain mapping and for computing the optimal coil position for treatment planning. In this grant, we propose to develop a deep-neural-network based method to accelerate E-field prediction. We will develop a novel deep-neural- network architecture to predict E-field by using training data computed using the FEM algorithm with anisotropic tissue conductivity. Then, we will integrate the trained neural network into a 3DSlicer software module for real- time E-field visualization. Moreover, we will develop a computational algorithm to search for the optimal coil position to maximize the stimulation of a selected brain target within a clinically feasible time. The outcome of this grant will transform deep-learning techniques into a useful tool to enhance the application of TMS in clinical research.

"Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation Project Summary  We are in critical need of targeted and individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affect nearly 50% of Americans during our lifetimes. Brain stimulation treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), represent the front-line of innovative approaches to correct dysfunctional brain networks for patients suffering from mental illness. rTMS is FDA-approved for depression and obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) with clinical trials underway for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use, among others. However, as currently administered, rTMS lacks a biomarker to individually optimize treatment and thus suffers from a poor clinical response rate (<50%). Without personalization of rTMS, we risk a one-size-fits-all treatment for all psychiatric disorders, not dissimilar to how antidepressants are administered.  Using simultaneous TMS and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), I identified a depression severity biomarker from a double-blind randomized clinical trial treating depressed patients with one month of active or placebo rTMS. The degree of this biomarker change significantly predicted clinical improvement after rTMS treatment. Direct brain recordings further suggest that a single stimulation session is sufficient to modulate this biomarker, indicating that this brain-based biomarker can be monitored daily to support empiric treatment optimization.  With this in mind, I propose to develop the first broadly generalizable platform for real-time biomarker monitoring (Aim #1) and personalized rTMS treatment (Aims #2 & 3). I will enroll 54 depressed patients to participate in a cross-over, placebo-controlled study directly comparing personalized, adaptive rTMS to standard rTMS. Primary outcome will be target engagement and dose-response of the depression severity biomarker. Successful implementation of this work includes the early stratification of treatment responders and personalized and more effective treatments for non-responders. This approach is broadly applicable to other depression biomarkers, all psychiatric populations treated with rTMS, and other brain stimulation modalities. More generally, my goals are to establish the fundamental principles of human brain plasticity and to construct platforms for rapid biomarker development, engagement, and integration into personalized brain stimulation treatments. Project Narrative We need targeted, individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affects nearly 50% of Americans. Brain stimulation treatments target dysfunctional brain networks with minimal side effects but are currently applied in a one-size-fits-all manner, thus limiting its efficacy. I aim to develop a non-invasive personalized brain stimulation platform for neuropsychiatric disorders; here I will create a real-time monitoring system for brain changes, evaluate the mechanism underlying these brain changes, and develop and test an adaptive stimulation paradigm to maximally drive individual brain changes and improve clinical outcome.","Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation",10020446,R01MH126639,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Markers', 'Book Chapters', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Length', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinical predictors', 'depressed patient', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'journal article', 'lectures', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'placebo controlled study', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'real time monitoring', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'side effect', 'substance use', 'tenure track', 'time use', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment responders', 'treatment stratification']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,391250
"Fusing motor neuroscience and artificial intelligence to create next-generation neural prostheses. ABSTRACT People with disabling motor disorders rely on assistive devices and caregivers for many of their most basic needs. Current assistive devices are inherently limited, as they rely on (and encumber) residual motor function as a command interface. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a pathway to more powerful assistive options by directly monitoring brain activity and using it to decipher movement intention in real-time. However, BMIs have yet to achieve performance and robustness that would warrant widespread clinical adoption. A key obstacle is that nearly all BMIs to date use direct decoding, i.e., they attempt to map the activity of brain areas like motor cortex (MC) directly onto external movement parameters such as velocity. This has resulted in BMIs that are brittle: they often fail in new contexts, and are highly sensitive to neural interface instabilities. Instead, I envision a radically different approach with the potential to impact virtually every existing BMI application. The central element is dynamical systems decoding (DSD), a framework I developed that fuses advances in motor neuroscience with cutting-edge AI methods to achieve unprecedented decoding accuracy. DSD uses neural networks to precisely reveal MC's complex internal activity patterns, known as dynamics, on a moment-by- moment basis. This enables a clean separation between activity related to internal dynamics and activity related to external movement parameters. In offline analyses, I showed that DSD enables a breakthrough in decoding, predicting movements on millisecond timescales with substantially higher accuracy than the current state-of-the- art. A key focus of this proposal is developing universal, subject-independent BMIs that harness the remarkable similarities in MC dynamics observed across subjects. Using new AI methods to model more than a decade of previously-collected monkey data, we will test whether subject-independent models can enable BMIs that work nearly `out of the box', with performance that could only be achieved through massive datasets, while still avoiding burdensome, subject-specific calibration. In parallel with offline studies, we will work directly with people who are paralyzed to develop online BMIs with unparalleled performance and robustness. Performance improvements will be achieved through hybrid decoding paradigms that capitalize on high-level movement information that is uniquely uncovered via DSD. While BMI robustness is typically limited in direct decoding – due to gradual changes in the specific neurons being monitored – DSD will enable robust BMIs by leveraging MC dynamics, which are stable for years and independent of whichever specific neurons are being monitored at a given time. These two innovations would enable BMIs that achieve unprecedented performance and on- demand, 24/7 reliability for years. If successful, these studies will pave the way to dramatically improving the performance, robustness, and clinical utility of nearly every BMI application. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a pathway to restore function for people who are paralyzed, such as those with spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This proposal aims to substantially increase the performance and robustness of BMIs by combining new developments from the field of artificial intelligence with recent advances in our understanding of brain function, with the goal of improving quality of life for people with severe movement disabilities.",Fusing motor neuroscience and artificial intelligence to create next-generation neural prostheses.,10246037,DP2NS127291,"['Adoption', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Intention', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Paralysed', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Residual state', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'brain machine interface', 'disability', 'dynamic system', 'functional restoration', 'improved', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'motor disorder', 'neural network', 'neural prosthesis', 'next generation', 'relating to nervous system', 'virtual']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,DP2,2021,1451191
"Mechanoregulation of Ciliary Motility Project Summary Mechanoregulation is a fundamental mechanism for the control of dynamic and multiscale biological systems. A mechanoregulatory network is responsible for the motility of cilia by converting the action of thousands of individual dynein motors bound to doublet microtubules in the cilium into a single waveform. This waveform has evolved to efficiently displace fluid, allowing either cell self-propulsion or the transport of extracellular liquid over epithelial surfaces. Ciliary motility in humans is therefore essential for the movement of sperm cells, the removal of bacteria and viruses from the respiratory tract, and the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Cilia are also used by protozoan pathogens for movement, contributing to their pathogenicity. The biflagellate alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has become the model system for studying the relationship between cilia ultrastructure and ciliary motilty. Using this organism, we have determined single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the bases of dyneins and mechanoregulatory complexes natively bound to doublet microtubules. These structures map the interconnected network of microtubules, mechanoregulators, and dynein motors in unparalleled atomic detail. The structures reveal the mechanisms that dock mechanoregulators to doublet microtubules and generate new hypotheses for how they control dynein behavior. These preliminary structural studies provide a unique opportunity to better understand the structure, function and assembly pathway of the largest mechanoregulator, the radial spoke. In aim 1, I propose to elucidate the complete structure of a native radial spoke using cryo-EM and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Structural information will resolve how its 20+ unique subunits interact and function together to respond to both mechanical and chemical signals. Due to the high conservation of radial-spoke subunits among organisms, our structure will provide insights into the etiology of ciliopathy-causing mutations in humans. In aim 2, I propose to test hypotheses that have arisen from our “on-doublet” structures using an interdisciplinary combination of structure-guided mutagenesis, waveform analysis by high-speed microcinematography, and structural characterization using electron cryotomography. This work will provide experimental evidence for the fundamental molecular mechanisms that control ciliary motility. In aim 3, I propose to use a proteomic and structural approach to determine the mechanisms of radial-spoke assembly. This work will test our current structure-based model of assembly and has the potential to identify the first radial-spoke biogenesis factors. Collectively, these studies will provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into the mechanoregulatory pathways that control ciliary motility and promises to open new avenues for the treatment of ciliopathies. Project Narrative Motile cilia are microtubule-based organelles that produce a driving force for cellular locomotion or fluid flow. In humans, defects in motile cilia can lead to infertility, chronic respiratory disease, and even reversal of the orientation of the bodily organs. This project aims to reveal the detailed workings of the mechanoregulatory network that controls ciliary motility, which will help us to better understand the molecular basis of cilia-related diseases.",Mechanoregulation of Ciliary Motility,10180150,R01GM141109,"['Algae', 'Animal Model', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Chlamydomonas reinhardtii', 'Chronic', 'Cilia', 'Cilium Microtubule', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Electrons', 'Epithelial', 'Etiology', 'Excision', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Machines', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oocytes', 'Organ', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Radial', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory System', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell motility', 'ciliopathy', 'cilium motility', 'crosslink', 'driving force', 'extracellular', 'fluid flow', 'insight', 'nexin', 'novel', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory virus', 'sperm cell']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,414050
