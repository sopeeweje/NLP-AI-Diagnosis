"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,10166954,R01NR016732,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Nursing', 'Research', 'Self Management', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain health', 'care costs', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'design', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'personalized intervention', 'physical conditioning', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home', 'social', 'technology validation', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352640
"Detecting Medical Emergencies in Isolated Older Adults Living Alone in Rural Areas Abstract Isolated older persons living alone in a rural house are at risk of being in medical distress without help. A rural house can be isolated from neighbors who can easily check on their well-being. As these people become elderly, they can have a high preference to stay in their home as long they believe they can care for themselves. An elderly person alone and in distress can be in a life and death situation in an isolated rural home. In an isolated rural house, many days can pass before someone decides to drive to their location to check on the elderly person. This project develops a low-cost monitoring solution for isolated rural elderly to safely lead independent lives. The phase I SBIR project will develop a wireless indoor tracking system to detect a person's location through several walls of a typical rural house. There will be no cables to run or need to install a complex array of sensors through the house. The cost of installation inexpensive. The system will have battery backup and protocols to operate over long power outages. It will also have a cell phone backup communication option should phone lines be down. The system will identify motions of the elderly person 24 hours a day in the house. Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms can detect abnormalities from their daily routine. The product is intended to be an optional accessory to in-home alert systems in use today and work with multiple vendors of in-home alert systems. It will operate in parallel with wearable buttons to signal an alert. Once the system identifies a distress event has occurred it will activate the alert system the same way as a wearable button press. The same alert protocol would be followed. In these systems an operator would first try to talk to the person with a speaker phone of the vendors' in-home alert system. If they cannot communicate with the person, they start working through a call list of local people to check on the home. The phase I will develop and test the wireless indoor tracking system and the Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms. Project Narrative Of the 60 million people living in rural United States, 15% are aged 65 years or older. People aged 70 and older constitute 13% of the population, but account for 20% of hospital treated falls and 70% of deaths. Falls lead the cause-of-injury deaths and nonfatal injury in people 65 and older, and over 30% of these require medical treatment and are sufficiently severe to make independent living difficult.",Detecting Medical Emergencies in Isolated Older Adults Living Alone in Rural Areas,10400417,R43MD017157,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Cloud Service', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Distress', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Friends', 'Grant', 'Home', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Independent Living', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Napping', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protocols documentation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spouses', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'aged', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'feasibility testing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'preference', 'prototype', 'rural area', 'sensor', 'transmission process']",NIMHD,APPLIED UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION,R43,2021,260303
"Precision Assessment Algorithm for Reducing Disaster-related Respiratory Health Disparities ABSTRACT Weather and climate disasters are responsible for over 13,000 deaths and $1.7 trillion additional costs over the last 40 years in the USA. Older adults are particularly susceptible to respiratory symptoms, disease exacerbation, unscheduled health care utilization, and decreased quality of life after disaster exposure to particulates, mold, and flooding. Our preliminary data reveal those with Black racial identities possess fewer resources to prepare for disaster. Profound racial disparities observed in the COVID-19 pandemic illustrate the devastating sequelae of long-standing macro-level disparities of segregated housing and sociopolitical networks. The long-term goal of this work is to eliminate racial disparities in large scale disaster health outcomes. The short-term goal of this research is to identify pathways of equal opportunity and disaster affirmative action interventions. The objective here is to create a software prototype of a machine learning algorithm with a novel, valid and reliable assessment tool of disaster vulnerability for older adults with chronic obstructive respiratory disease, prioritizing equality of opportunity to reduce racial bias and disparity. Our specific aims are to 1) Empirically validate a novel assessment tool of disaster vulnerability using self-reported items and scoring system, 2) Refine the validated instrument with a machine learning based algorithm for precision prediction of household emergency preparedness for disaster, 3) Assess racial disparities, data and algorithm bias for Black participants in household hazard vulnerabilities and our instrument development process, and 4) Test interoperability with existing customer software platforms as a plug-in software add-on. We will accomplish these aims using a mixed-methods approach, recruiting 20 expert panel members and up to 600 potential end-user participants, working to over-sample those who reside in predominantly Black communities and Black racial identities. The knowledge gained from this study will provide foundational work to develop precision interventions to reduce post-disaster respiratory symptoms, disease exacerbation, unscheduled health care utilization, and decrements in respiratory quality of life. The results of this study will inform the next generation of electronic health record and patient reported outcomes applications, ensuring the validity, prognostic accuracy, and machine learning models are most relevant to those at highest risk for racial disparities: those with Black racial identities. Health care providers can use our software tool to target and optimize disaster telehealth service lines and increase intervention precision to reduce disaster morbidity and mortality disparities. Our goal is to identify pathways of equal opportunity or precision affirmative action interventions to eliminate racial disparities in large scale disaster health outcomes. Here, we propose to create a software prototype of a machine learning algorithm with a valid and reliable measure to score household occupant disaster vulnerability for older adults with chronic obstructive respiratory disease, prioritizing mathematical modeling of equality of opportunity to reduce racial bias and disparity. Collecting and analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data, we aim to: 1) validate a novel assessment instrument, 2) test the instrument for precision prediction of household emergency preparedness for disaster, 3) assess racial disparities, data and algorithm bias for those with Black racial identities, and 4) test the interoperability of our novel software prototype with existing electronic health record platforms.",Precision Assessment Algorithm for Reducing Disaster-related Respiratory Health Disparities,10401726,R43MD017188,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Floods', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Housing', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molds', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Particulate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Quarantine', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Self Assessment', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Software Tools', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral response', 'climate disaster', 'cost', 'disparities in morbidity', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'hazard', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interoperability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'mortality disparity', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'personalized intervention', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'racial bias', 'racial disparity', 'racial identity', 'recruit', 'respiratory', 'respiratory health', 'respiratory morbidity', 'skills', 'telehealth', 'weather-related disaster']",NIMHD,CASTNER INCORPORATED,R43,2021,228344
"Individualized Vestibular Rehabilitation for Elderly with Self-Management and Gaming Elements Project Summary/Abstract: Vestibular rehabilitation has been proven to be effective in reducing dizziness and falls in older adults, but patient adherence is a major problem. Recent research shows that less than half of patients complete their rehabilitation. Some of the main reasons for this are the numerous visits that are required and accessibility. In particular for older individuals who experience dizziness and/or falls, it may be difficult to travel to attend rehabilitation sessions. Additionally, rehabilitation programs become expensive in terms of equipment and health professional’s time. Programs may also not be available to all who may benefit because of geographical limitations. Previous research has shown that remote monitoring and gaming elements have great potential to solve these issues, even in an older population. However, current solutions are generic and effectiveness can be inconsistent. The overall goal of this project is to develop a vestibular rehabilitation app to be used by older adults at home. The app will improve adherence through gaming, self-management, and remote monitoring. Patients will use low-cost sensors placed on their bodies (head and waist) to play the games on the app. This allows simultaneous monitoring of patient progress while performing the exercises. This data can be shared with a clinician via email or the cloud, allowing the patient to perform the rehabilitation at their home and the clinician to monitor how well the patients performed their exercises. The vestibular rehabilitation components are packaged in a phone and tablet app that is easy to navigate for older individuals and has a modular design that allows individualized rehabilitation. By improving patient engagement and enjoyment, rehabilitation adherence should be improved as well. Phase I demonstrated feasibility of this approach. In Phase II, games will be added to cover a full at-home rehabilitation session and improve usability of the app. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be developed to provide real-time feedback if exercises are performed incorrectly. This ensures patients will perform their exercises correctly when at home. As in Phase I, clinical collaborators will provide continued guidance and testing throughout development to ensure clinical relevance and promote adoption during commercialization. This project uses a novel approach in that it develops rehabilitation games specifically designed for vestibular rehabilitation through a mobile app tailored for an older population. Current gaming approaches for rehabilitation typically use existing or commercial games. The use of sensors for remote monitoring is also novel in this area and allows patients to perform rehabilitation at their home, while being monitored by a clinician. This project is therefore likely to have a high clinical impact. It will advance clinical practice, make vestibular rehabilitation more accessible to older individuals, and help adherence to programs. Successful implementation of this program will reduce falls and improve quality of life of for patients. Project Narrative: The overall goal of this project is to develop an app for older individuals that will improve accessibility of vestibular rehabilitation and that will improve compliance compared to current rehabilitation programs. The proposed effort uses a novel approach that combines low-cost inertial sensors and machine learning algorithms with mobile device technology to measure performance, provide real-time feedback, and present data in a comprehensible way to the clinician via email or the cloud, removing the patients’ need to travel for rehabilitation sessions. These features are packaged in an app that is appropriate for and appealing to older users to improve compliance, and uses novel gaming elements specifically developed for vestibular rehabilitation rather than repurposing existing commercial games designed for younger users and entertainment.",Individualized Vestibular Rehabilitation for Elderly with Self-Management and Gaming Elements,10256015,R44DC017408,"['Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dizziness', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Exercise', 'Eye', 'Fall prevention', 'Feedback', 'Florida', 'Focus Groups', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Health care facility', 'Home', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Kansas', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Older Population', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Self Management', 'Software Design', 'Supervision', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'falls', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient engagement', 'physical therapist', 'programs', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation science', 'remote monitoring', 'remote sensor', 'sensor', 'usability', 'visual tracking', 'web portal']",NIDCD,CFD RESEARCH CORPORATION,R44,2021,793588
"Determining Barriers to Achieving Optimal Post-Acute Care Destinations Project Summary 13 million Medicare beneficiaries are discharged from acute care hospitals annually, and approximately 42% of these older adults receive referrals to post-acute care (PAC) services including long term acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing facilities, and home health care. Effective referrals that promote patient health and prevent negative outcomes rely on coordinated discharge planning. However, this coordination is difficult to achieve when interprofessional discharge planning teams frequently face time constraints, team communication issues, variance in risk tolerance in decision making, and inconsistent assessments. Therefore, significant variation in discharge planning practices exists at the individual and hospital level and there are no clinical guidelines for this common but crucial process. Without standardized discharge planning practices in place, patients are at risk for negative outcomes after discharge including social and economic disparities in PAC referral location, unnecessary treatments, unplanned hospital readmissions, and increased healthcare costs. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) equip clinicians with evidence-based, individualized information about their patients at the point of care, and address the urgent need for standardized solutions to improve discharge planning decisions. The Discharge Referral Expert System for Care Transitions (DIRECT) is a recently developed CDSS algorithm (RO1-2-NR007674) that identifies which patients need PAC and suggests the level of care as home health care or facility-level care based on patient needs. Use of DIRECT in discharge planning is associated with a reduction in hospital readmissions, however, hospital clinicians referred 26% fewer patients to PAC than DIRECT. This discordance has been historically difficult to study due to the unstructured nature of discharge planning data in clinical notes, making data abstraction and analysis difficult to achieve. The proposed study prepares the applicant to advance the DIRECT algorithm and expand it to a new clinical setting through two specific aims: 1) Among patients discharged without PAC, compare patient characteristics and 30-day readmission rates between those identified by DIRECT as needing PAC and those where DIRECT and clinicians agreed on no referral for PAC and 2) Identify the reasons associated with discharge home without services when the DIRECT CDSS recommends PAC. The proposed study will expand an existing CDSS developed in a suburban community hospital to a new population in a large urban hospital and utilize natural language processing methods to advance the understanding of why some patients do not receive the recommended level of PAC. The findings from this study will illuminate possible implementation and algorithm refinement strategies for future prospective study, and align with the applicant’s long term research goals to improve transitions in care for older adults by developing and implementing CDSS. The results of this study address the National Institute of Nursing Research’s mission to improve the health of older adults by supporting innovative technology. Project Narrative The growing older adult population with increasing post-acute care needs after hospitalization underscores the need for coordinated discharge planning. As healthcare data becomes increasingly prolific and patient needs become more complex, there is opportunity for evidence-based technology such as clinical decision support systems to improve decision making at the point of care. Understanding the reasons why patients do not receive optimal post-acute care referrals is critical to improving the discharge planning process for older adults and their families.",Determining Barriers to Achieving Optimal Post-Acute Care Destinations,10226410,F31NR019919,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Destinations', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Elderly', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Expert Systems', 'Face', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recommendation', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Standardization', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urban Hospitals', 'Variant', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care systems', 'cost', 'economic disparity', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'hospital utilization', 'improved', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'readmission rates', 'readmission risk', 'social disparities', 'suburb', 'suburban communities', 'training opportunity', 'unnecessary treatment']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,46036
"Multi-omics approach to frailty resilience Frailty is a complex clinical condition that is characterized by increased vulnerability to disability and high risk for mortality in older adults. Identifying biological mechanisms that protect from frailty is an important step in the development of effective therapies that protect from and delay frailty. Aging is a major risk factor for frailty; thus, studying biological mechanisms and populations that delay aging may lead to the identification of molecular factors that can protect from frailty. The biological approaches thus far have mainly focused on descriptive phenotypes, such as inflammatory plasma profile and candidate gene approaches, looking for risk factors for frailty. It is apparent, however, that frailty is a complex syndrome, akin to other complex disorders; thus, simplistic approaches that focus on one genetic variant or inflammatory biomarker at a time are unlikely to yield satisfactory progress. Moreover, to date, few attempts have been made to identify protective biological components of resilience to frailty. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of experts who will tackle these barriers by applying state-of-the-art multi-omics approach to test the hypothesis that unique genomic, epigenomic and proteomic profiles, which are enriched among families with exceptional longevity, are associated with resilience to frailty. Frailty resilience will be quantified using a newly devised and validated measure, the Frailty Resilience Score (FRS), that incorporates the complex biology of frailty by integrating genetic risk in the form of frailty- specific polygenic risk score (PRS), age, and sex. The FRS will be studied in the context of a multi-omics approach to identify the genomic (Aim 1), epigenomic (Aim 2), and proteomic (Aim 3) components that protect from frailty. Whole exome sequencing and SNP arrays will be used to identify gene variants and gene sets associated with frailty resilience (Aim 1). DNA methylation across 850,000 CpG sites will be used for epigenomic discovery (Aim 2) and approximately 5,000 plasma proteins for the proteomic discovery (Aim 3) of resilience markers and pathways. Additionally, integration of proteomics with genomics and epigenomics will be performed to identify common mechanisms and pathways of frailty resilience. These approaches will be applied to a longitudinal cohort of older adults (n=1,400; mean age 76, median follow-up 8 years) from the ongoing LonGenity study, who are annually evaluated with frailty measures, have banked DNA, and whose samples have already been subjected to WES and proteomic analysis. This unique cohort is (1) enriched with protective genes, as half of them are offspring of centenarians and is (2) relatively homogeneous genetically, as all subjects are from an Ashkenazi Jewish founder population, a feature that increases the power for genetic and biological discovery. This multi-omics approach has the potential to both expand our understanding of biology and result in discovery of biomarkers for frailty resilience. Understanding the biologic mechanisms that protect from multi-system failure in older adults is a first step in generating interventions against frailty; while identification of biomarkers will inform us, in the short-term, of the effectiveness of interventions that aim to delay aging and frailty. Project Narrative Frailty is a common clinical condition in older adults that is characterized by increased vulnerability to disability and mortality, and is a major burden for the healthcare system in the United States. Aging is the main risk factor for frailty; however, families of centenarians delay aging and are protected from frailty.

"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,10221562,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,404743
"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood.

"Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) ABSTRACT Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries in older adults (ages 65+). Injuries due to falling result in 2.8 million emergency visits annually, and 25% of falls result in very serious injuries (such as fractures or traumatic brain injury). Through this diversity supplement, Dr. Monroe Kennedy, an engineer interested in aging research, seeks to get training and mentoring in geroscience. As part of this diversity supplement, Dr. Kennedy, proposes to develop a wearable smartbelt device that can alert the wearer to risk of falling and potentially prevent falls. Combined with a robust training plan, the proposed activities will prepare Dr. Kennedy to become a leader in geriatrics research and make impactful contributions to the field of aging research.  Aim 1 will be to conduct focus groups with older adults on the wearable smartbelt device, such as style and comfort. Aim 2 will test the wearable smartbelt device by collecting visual and sensor data from older adults while walking on various surfaces at slow and brisk paces. The data will be used to train the falls prevention model utilizing machine learning methods. The ultimate goal is for the model to be able to calculate fall risk by predicting potential walking trajectories of the wearer and imbalance and alert the wearer via vibrotactile response if the risk of falling is probable. By preventing falls from occurring in the first place, the proposed device has the potential to greatly increase the overall well-being, long-term health, and independence of older adults as well as costs associated with hospital visits and caregiving. PROJECT NARRATIVE Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries for older adults. The goal of this project is to develop a wearable smartbelt device that can predict whether the wearer is at risk of falling so that the wearer can stop and ensure they are balanced before continuing to walk. This technology has the potential to prevent older adults from falling in the first place, thereby improving their overall long-term health, quality of life, and independence.",Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE),10319307,P30AG059307,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Fall prevention', 'Focus Groups', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'caregiving', 'cost', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P30,2021,35326
"Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients with Serious Illness Although discussions that address patients' goals of care are one of the most important aspects of palliative care, this communication is often lacking in our healthcare system. Goals-of-care communication is associated with improved patient and family outcomes and reduced intensity of care at the end of life. Electronic health records (EHR) provide a key opportunity to identify patients who would benefit from these discussions and to promote these discussions, yet prior interventions have not used the EHR for this purpose.  Older adults with chronic illness, and particularly those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), are especially vulnerable to inappropriately intensive end-of-life care. To address this shortcoming, we build on two of our most successful programs, one using the EHR to identify goals-of-care discussions and the other a novel intervention called Jumpstart that promotes and enhances these discussions. We will examine the effectiveness of the Jumpstart intervention for hospitalized older adults with chronic illness and specifically oversample those with ADRD to understand the effectiveness of the intervention in this key group.  We propose 2 linked, complementary randomized trials. Trial 1, a pragmatic trial, compares usual care with a clinician-facing Jumpstart for hospitalized older adults with serious illness (n=2000). Trial 2, a comparative effectiveness trial, compares this clinician-facing Jumpstart with a bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart based on surveys completed by patients or family members (n=400). We hypothesize that the clinician-facing Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to usual care, and the bi-directional, patient- specific Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart. We use an innovative hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach to accomplish 3 aims. Aim 1 evaluates the effectiveness of the clinician-facing Jumpstart, compared with usual care, for improving quality of care; the primary outcome is EHR documentation of a goals-of-care discussion during the hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include intensity of care at the end of life. Aim 2 evaluates the effectiveness of the bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart; the primary outcome is the same as Trial 1. We will examine the same secondary outcomes, but also include patient- and family-reported outcomes assessed by surveys at 1 and 3 months after randomization including occurrence and quality of goals-of-care communication in the hospital, goal-concordant care, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and palliative care needs. We will also examine costs of care after accounting for costs of the interventions. In Aim 3, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators to future implementation and dissemination.  Our team has experience conducting innovative multi-center trials with patient-centered outcomes, economic analyses, and implementation science. This novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach addresses key knowledge gaps to improve the quality and value of care for older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Communication about goals of care is one of the most important aspects of palliative care for older adults, yet the lack of this communication is a major shortcoming in our healthcare system. We propose 2 linked and innovative randomized trials to evaluate a novel intervention that promotes and enhances goals-of-care discussions for hospitalized patients with serious chronic illness.

"Multimorbidity and Treatment-Related Outcomes in Older Heart Failure Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is the most common reason for hospitalization in older adults. Over 85% of all patients hospitalized with HF are 65 years of age or older. Multimorbidity, typically defined as the presence of ≥2 chronic conditions, increases the risks of hospitalization and death in older HF patients, and greatly complicates the clinical management of HF. Caution is required in applying national clinical practice guidelines to the care of older adults with multimorbidity, as this could result in undesirable net effects and less than optimal outcomes including adverse interactions between drugs and various concomitant diseases. In response to PA-17-088 (Exploratory Analyses of Existing Cohorts, Data Sets, and Stored Biospecimens to Address Clinical Aging Research Questions, R01), we propose to leverage an existing HF cohort, including data for more than 100,000 patients with HF within the Cardiovascular Research Network between 2005-2012, with follow-up data up to 2017. We will extend our previous efforts by examining treatment patterns and the net benefits versus harms of selected therapies in older adults with HF and a wide spectrum of multimorbidity burden. We will further examine the benefits and adverse outcomes of various therapies focusing on particularly vulnerable subgroups of patients with HF afflicted by two prevalent conditions, anemia or diabetes. Our specific aims are: (1) to examine the effectiveness of selected medical therapies (renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system blockers, beta-blockers, diuretics, and aldosterone receptor blockers) on death, HF hospitalization, and all-cause hospitalizations in a large, community-based population of older adults with HF across a range of levels of multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction; (2) to evaluate targeted adverse outcomes, including kidney dysfunction, hyperkalemia, sodium disturbances, bradycardia, and syncope associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF, stratified by multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction status; and (3) to characterize the potential benefits and adverse outcomes associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF and two prevalent comorbidity dyads—HF- diabetes and HF-anemia—that are common and substantially increase the risks of death and morbidity. In addition, we will create novel, validated methods to identify adverse outcomes related to HF therapies from unstructured data in large electronic health record systems through natural language processing technology, along with employing state-of-the-art analytic approaches to evaluate treatment-related outcomes. In that our proposed investigation will take advantage of a large, geographically and demographically diverse cohort of adults with HF receiving care within community-based healthcare delivery systems, we anticipate our findings will be highly generalizable to the broad spectrum of older adults with HF managed in “real-world” practice settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The presence of multiple chronic conditions, or multimorbidity, in older adults with heart failure substantially increases the complexity of their care, and increases the risks of hospitalization and death.

"Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects 70% of older adults and remains the leading cause of morbidity and mor- tality in the United States. Several new drugs have recently been approved for CVD, but not enough is known about their utilization, benefits and risks in frail older patients. Since conducting a clinical trial in frail older adults can be costly and impractical, there is a pressing need for innovative strategies to generate evidence on new CVD drugs in a timely manner. The objective of this application is to establish a near-real-time prospective monitoring program in Medicare data to evaluate the benefit of new CVD drugs for older adults with frailty. A prospective monitoring program seeks to find early effectiveness and safety signals of new drugs by updating the analysis at regular intervals as new Medicare data become available. The investigators will incorporate a novel claims-based frailty index into the monitoring program to generate timely evidence on disease-specific and patient-centered net benefit of new drugs by frailty status. The central hypothesis is that disease-specific benefit and net benefit are determined by a patient's degree of frailty. Disease-specific benefit will be evaluated using clinical trial endpoints of effectiveness (e.g., CVD events) and safety (e.g., bleeding), and net benefit in terms of the number of days alive and spent at home, or “home time”. To conduct this work, the investigators will analyze Medicare data on 6 new CVD drugs approved in 2011-2017: 3 anticoagulants vs warfarin for atrial fibrillation, 2 antiplatelets vs clopidogrel for atherosclerotic CVD, and an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor vs enalapril for systolic heart failure. The validity and reproducibility of the results will be enhanced through the linkage of a subset of Medicare data to electronic health records and a national survey to supplement clinical information, and external validation of the Medicare data analysis in 2 large commercial databases. In the next 4 years, the investigators will accomplish 3 specific aims: 1) evaluate the temporal trends and predictors of new CVD drug use in frail and non-frail older adults with CVD over 2011-2020; 2) determine disease-specific benefit (deaths, CVD and safety events) and net benefit (home time) of 6 new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies; 3) identify patient characteristics that can predict net benefit (home time) with new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies. This proposal's innovative approach, which combines near-real-time prospective monitor- ing, a claims-based frailty score, and the patient-centered outcome of home time, offers a readily scalable and feasible framework for comparative effectiveness and safety studies of newly approved medications. The impact of the proposed research is significant because timely evidence generated from real-world healthcare data can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new CVD drugs based on a patient's frailty and expected net benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to establish a prospective monitoring program for newly approved cardiovascular drugs for older adults with frailty in routine healthcare databases and identify predictors of benefit from the new drugs. This research is relevant to public health because the evidence generated from this work can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new cardiovascular drugs in older adults based on a patient's frailty level and expected net benefit. Thus, it accomplishes the National Institute on Aging's missions and initiatives by promoting effective and safe drug therapy in older adults.",Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty,10102161,R01AG062713,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Anticoagulants', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enalapril', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frail Elderly', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neprilysin', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical trial analysis', 'clopidogrel', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'cost', 'frailty', 'head-to-head comparison', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'safety study', 'sex']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,723192
"Advancing Interdisciplinary Science of Aging through Identification of Iatrogenic Complications: The UF EHR Clinical Data Infrastructure for Enhanced Patient Safety among the Elderly (UF-ECLIPSE) Project Summary/Abstract Iatrogenic conditions are a continuing public health concern, causing death among an estimated two hundred and fifty thousand older adults annually in United States (US) hospitals. Hospital-acquired falls and hospital- induced delirium are among the most common and costly iatrogenic conditions, and their occurrences are linked to each other. Advances in computing technology and availability of electronic data presents opportunities to more accurately identify identifying patients at risk of suffering a hospital-acquired fall or hospital-induced delirium. Clinical data is now being captured electronically for about 80% of the US population. Approximately 75-80% of clinical data is text data which cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical methods. The development of a research data infrastructure that supports the use of text and structured data is critical for a learning health system aimed at improving care and patient outcomes. In this project, we propose to expand the research infrastructure for electronic data-driven knowledge generation through the development of the University of Florida (UF) EHR Data Infrastructure for Patient Safety among the Elderly (UF-ECLIPSE). The long-term goal of our research program is to enhance the safety of hospitalized older adults by reducing iatrogenic conditions through an effective learning health system. We plan to carry out the following aims: Specific Aim 1 (R21 Phase): Identify and test the feasibility of text-mining pipelines to process registered nurses' (RNs) progress notes for prediction of hospital-acquired falls. We will employ a combination of supervised and unsupervised text-mining methods to identify text attributes associated with patient falls. We will then leverage a predictive model of patient fall risk factors developed in previous work to generate a composite model of text and structured data to predict the odds of a patient falling. Specific Aim 2 (R33 Phase): Determine and evaluate the structural and human resources of an expanded research-data infrastructure to support sustained interdisciplinary aging studies. We will develop and pilot test text-mining pipelines to generate a prediction model of hospital-induced delirium. We will then integrate the developed pipelines into the existing UF Health Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) infrastructure and test to assess functionality, durability and scalability. In addition, we propose to develop the human resource infrastructure to support data-driven interdisciplinary aging research. This will be achieved by training graduate students in interdisciplinary data science for aging research. The UF-ECLIPSE research team will be among the first to implement and test an integrated data repository that utilizes nurse-generated structured and text data to support a learning health system. This study will create important new research data infrastructure, and will be a model for health care organizations to increase safe effective care for the millions of older adult Americans hospitalized every day. Project Narrative Our long-term goal is to enhance the safety of hospitalized older adults by reducing iatrogenic conditions through an effective learning health system. To achieve this goal, we will expand a research infrastructure for electronic data-driven knowledge generation through the development of the University of Florida (UF) EHR Clinical Data Infrastructure for Patient Safety among the Elderly (UF-ECLIPSE).

"Understanding and Predicting High-Need, High-Cost Patients among Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This is a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award submitted to the National Institute on Aging by Yongkang Zhang, a Research Associate in the Department of Healthcare Policy and Research at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC). Dr. Zhang’s career goal is to become an independent researcher on improving care for the elderly through developing and applying effective prediction tools to identify older adults with complex conditions and high healthcare needs. This K99/R00 application will provide Dr. Zhang with the necessary training 1) to understand the complexity and characteristics of high-need, high-cost (HNHC) older adults; 2) to develop a prediction model for HNHC adults using machine learning methods; and 3) to test the performance of the machine learning-based model with three commonly used, patient-risk prediction tools.  Dr. Zhang has assembled a mentor team of accomplished researchers across multiple divisions and departments at Weill Cornell Medical College: Dr. Rainu Kaushal (primary mentor) who is the Nanette Laitman Distinguished Professor and an expert on the HNHC patients and health data science; Dr. Lawrence Casalino (co-mentor) who is the Livingston Farrand Professor of Public Health and an expert on characteristics of and healthcare delivery for HNHC patients; Dr. Mark Lachs (co-mentor) who is a Professor of Geriatrics and prac- ticing geriatrician and an expert on the complexity and healthcare needs of older adults; Dr. Yuhua Bao (co- mentor) who is an Associate Professor of Healthcare Policy and Research and expert on behavioral health conditions and prescription data; Dr. Fei Wang (co-mentor) who is an Associate Professor of Health Informat- ics and an expert on machine learning methods; and Dr. James Flory (consultant) who is an Assistant Profes- sor of Healthcare Policy and Research and practicing clinician and an expert on medication use.  HNHC older adults are small group of patients representing a disproportionate share of healthcare utili- zation. These patients are more likely to experience preventable quality and safety problems due to their fre- quent interactions with health systems. Caring for HNHC older adults provides great potential benefits for qual- ity improvement and cost reduction. However, the benefits are unlikely to be realized unless these patients can be correctly identified and targeted. Building on his previous research and training on developing a claims data-based taxonomy for HNHC Medicare patients, Dr. Zhang’s research will understand the characteristics of HNHC older adults and develop predictors for these patients using clinical and prescription data (Aim 1), de- velop a machine learning-based prediction model for HNHC older adults (Aim 2), and compare the perfor- mance of the prediction model with three commonly used, patient risk prediction tools (Aim 3). This research will be the foundation for an R01 grant application that will incorporate this prediction model into healthcare de- livery process and identify the optimal ways to inform opportunities for improvement in healthcare delivery. PROJECT NARRATIVE High-need, high-cost (HNHC) older adults are a small group of individuals representing a disproportionate share of healthcare utilization and experiencing preventable quality and safety problems. Improving care for HNHC older adults is challenging because of their complex medical, behavioral, and social conditions and the instability of their healthcare utilization. Developing a prediction model for HNHC older adults could better inform patient-centered clinical decision-making, help target quality improvement interventions, and prioritize the allocation of scarce healthcare resources.","Understanding and Predicting High-Need, High-Cost Patients among Older Adults",10150732,K99AG064030,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policy Research', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Conditions', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'career', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'distinguished professor', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'frailty', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'health care service organization', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'multilayer perceptron', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'performance tests', 'post-doctoral training', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'random forest', 'risk prediction', 'social', 'social vulnerability', 'tool']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2021,125185
"A Multi-modal Imaging Model to Predict Mobility in Older Adults Although functional and structural MRI have been used to characterize aging, disease, and cognition, the central nervous system mechanisms linking early mobility impairments to subsequent motor and cognitive decline remain under-explored. The current proposal investigates brain contributions to the clinically valuable measure of walking speed, a known predictor of incident falls, disability, and Alzheimer’s dementia and related dementias (ADRD) in older age. Several studies to date have found evidence that neurocognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration result in slower walking. The observed relationships, however, are not consistent across studies. Structural investigations may or may not report relationships with impaired mobility; age-related declines of structure are variable, spatially diffuse, and cannot be fully captured in a single imaging modality. The applicant’s previous work has shown that brain function may be a promising predictor of gait and complementary to structural measures. However, because the majority of imaging investigations have been unimodal and cross-sectional, less is known about the neural mechanisms linking gait to future adverse health outcomes. This project combines complementary imaging data across multiple MR modalities to determine whether major neural drivers of motor function can be used to predict subsequent motor and cognitive decline, like disability and ADRD. Specifically, the applicant will: 1) develop an integrative model utilizing functional and structural MR biomarkers to predict cross-sectional gait and motor function within older adults from the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and MOBILIZE Boston Study (MBS) cohorts, and 2) determine the extent to which these biomarkers may be used to predict future motor and cognitive decline, incident disability, and ADRD. For this project, the applicant’s central hypothesis is that subtle structural and functional compromise to regions belonging to the executive and attention neural networks link abnormal gait to motor and cognitive decline in older age. For this three-year Career Development Award, the applicant proposes to pursue these research aims and train in advanced statistical modeling and data science, physiologic and mobility measurement, and the neurobiology and neuropathology underlying mobility limitations, disability, and ADRD under the guidance of a multi-disciplinary multi-institutional team. The specific research and statistical modeling methods gained from this project supports the applicant’s long-term goal to inform successful aging for older adults by (1) investigating the neural mechanisms that contribute to functional impairments commonly encountered in older age, (2) identifying early biomarkers of these declines, and (3) developing neuroscience-informed interventions for improved outcomes. Project Narrative While walking was once thought to be a highly automated process, it has been shown to be increasingly complex, requiring additional neurocognitive resources, with older age. The overall objectives of this proposal are to: 1) identify the most important brain contributions to walking for older adults in a discovery cohort; and 2) test the generalizability of these brain associations with walking and general motor function in a replication cohort. This study will identify major neural mechanisms and targets to inform rehabilitation for individuals facing mobility challenges.",A Multi-modal Imaging Model to Predict Mobility in Older Adults,10146935,K01AG064044,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'diffusion weighted', 'disability', 'early detection biomarkers', 'executive function', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'motor impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'neuroregulation', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'study population', 'vector', 'walking speed', 'white matter damage']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2021,125847
"Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging PROJECT SUMMARY Prevalent, morbid, and costly ($66 billion/year in 2007), incontinence is a major problem, especially for older adults, in whom the most common type is urgency incontinence (UUI). Generally ascribed to bladder spasms, UUI's actual causes are unknown, and therapy remains inadequate. Recent data suggest that one cause is poor bladder control by the brain. In our recent R01 we used biofeedback (BFB) as a probe to explore this. The exciting findings suggest that one `phenotype' of UUI in older adults seems to be caused by a breakdown in brain control, which can be restored by successful behavioral therapy, while another is refractory. Our proposed new study will explore this further by attempting to differentiate the mechanisms associated with disease and aging. The goal is to identify which brain mechanisms should be suppressed because they are contributing to or causing UUI, which should be enhanced because they are helping to compensate for UUI, and which should be ignored because they are incidental to aging and not related to UUI. Current data suggest that bladder control comprises 3 cerebral circuits that maintain continence by suppressing the voiding reflex in the midbrain. In our UUI phenotype that responded to BFB, the mechanism involved enhancing deactivation of the first brain circuit (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) which resulted in less activation of the second circuit (which includes the midcingulate cortex). In the phenotype that was resistant to BFB, no brain changes were seen. Yet, although we have an emerging picture of the brain's role in UUI, we have only rudimentary understanding of what is `normal', i.e. how the brain normally controls the bladder. More relevant, we do not know whether this control mechanism is the same across the lifespan, or if it changes owing to the impact of aging. Thus, our overall aim is to characterize continence control in both young and old people, and examine how changes due to bladder control failure differ in each age group. Our specific aims are to characterize normal voiding in the continent old and young in order to better understand and verify the working model and to use the comparison to older adults with UUI to understand the mechanism of brain failure in these individuals. To address these aims, we will conduct a detailed clinical and neuroimaging study to study 80 asymptomatic women and 80 UUI women, each group divided equally into young (18-45) and old (65+ years). The study will enable us to evaluate the changes in brain structure and function and to identify brain mechanisms involved in continence control, changes due to aging (both benign and contributory to UUI), and changes due to disease. The study will provide the comprehensive data on brain mechanisms involved in the normal continence mechanism in order to better corroborate our working model, understand the aging process, and assess targets for therapy. It will thereby enable scientists to develop novel and more effective new therapies based on the revolution in neuroscience—and more hope for UUI sufferers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Urge urinary incontinence is a common problem in older people which vastly reduces quality of life, yet the cause and mechanism of disease are not well understood. This study will characterize brain control of the bladder in young and old continent individuals and age-matched wet counterparts. This will expand our current knowledge of how the brain controls the bladder, better characterize the `ideal' mechanism and suggest ways in which we can better target treatment.",Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging,10263175,R01AG065288,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Biofeedback', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Control', 'Bladder Dysfunction', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Incidence', 'Incontinence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Micturition Reflex', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Premenopause', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Refractory', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Spasm', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Urge Incontinence', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Woman', 'age group', 'age related', 'aged', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'innovation', 'micturition urgency', 'mind control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,612748
"Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease A growing number of older patients are living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to advances in life- prolonging technologies and the aging of the population. As CKD advances towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD), even life-prolonging technologies cannot extend life indefinitely, especially for patients who have a poor prognosis and for whom decisions about medical interventions become particularly important. Consequently, older patients with advanced CKD need to communicate with their physicians about their preferences regarding CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care (medical management of symptoms of advanced CKD without dialysis) in order to make crucial decisions impacting the length and quality of their lives. Communication surrounding medical decision making is formalized in Advance Care Planning (ACP), a process involving verbal or written information designed to inform patients of possible medical options including CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care. Traditional ACP for patients with ESRD relies on ad hoc verbal descriptions of treatment options. This approach is limited because these options are difficult to envision. We have developed a video decision aid for reviewing CPR, dialysis and non-dialytic treatment preferences in ESRD. The tool, which is available in both English and Spanish, also allows patients to video record their preferences (""video declaration"") and share their preferences with their clinicians and caregivers. The overall objective of this study is to conduct a multi-center randomized trial of the video intervention (vs. usual care) to test the hypothesis that the video better informs older persons with advanced CKD and poor prognosis of their treatment options and leads to more ACP documentation, informed decision making, and improved quality of life. We will compare ACP documentation after one year (or at time of death) among 600 patients aged 75 or older with advanced CKD and poor prognosis randomly assigned to either the video intervention or usual care (Aim 1). We will compare ESRD treatment preferences, decisional conflict, ACP engagement and conversations, and concordance of preferences stated after the video intervention or usual care with ESRD care delivery after one year (or at time of death) (Aim 2). We will explore the quality of life, longevity, and cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) associated with patients' ESRD treatment decisions in the video vs. control groups (Aim 3). We will also conduct a qualitative assessment of the video declarations as well as barriers and facilitators for intervention success (Aims 4 and 5). ESRD in older patients involves complex decision making. It is imperative that we develop and evaluate early interventions to deliver more patient- focused care to this rapidly growing segment of the population. Using videos to enhance communication offers an opportunity to improve care of this vulnerable group of patients. Video is a practical, evidence-based, and innovative approach that has the potential to improve the quality of care provided to tens of thousands of older Americans. It is imperative to develop scalable and effective approaches to supporting persons with advanced kidney disease and their family caregivers. By providing video education tools to better inform persons making decisions about medical care and offering evidence-based options for kidney care, there is an opportunity to improve quality of life throughout the care trajectory.",Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease,10144365,R01AG066892,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Aging', 'American', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Documentation', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'End stage renal failure', 'Family Caregiver', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Supportive care', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'aged', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'older patient', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,2122297
"Innovative technologies for active surveillance of older adults with low-risk skin cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the number one cancer diagnosed in the US each year and accounts for more cases than all other cancers combined.1,2 Most BCCs are not dangerous, as they typically grow slowly and rarely metastasize or affect quality of life. Because cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a major cause of these lesions, BCCs are considered a non-lethal disease of aging, with the vast majority occurring in people 65 years or older. Despite the low risk BCCs present to patients, in the US all lesions are usually treated. Though existing treatments are effective,3,4 post treatment complications are common; in one prospective cohort study 27% of patients reported a problem after a procedure.5 Moreover, over 100,000 BCCs are treated annually in persons who ultimately die within one year of unrelated causes.6 For patients near the end of life, who often manage multiple health issues, treating these lesions may expose them to the associated medical risks with little potential benefit.7  There is a pressing need to reduce over-treatment and instead develop safe and effective active surveillance methods for low risk BCC in older patients. This research aims to fundamentally change the current “one size fits all” standard of care for treatment of BCCs, which is particularly problematic for older adults.6,8,9 The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). We hypothesize that home-based active surveillance of low risk BCCs would reduce unnecessary procedures, complications and burdensome clinic visits in patients whose BCCs are not changing, while ensuring that patients whose BCCs grow or become symptomatic receive prompt care. For the first step of the proposed research, we will refine an existing artificial intelligence algorithm and mobile app to optimize it for at-home active surveillence use for older adults with low-risk BCC. We will then conduct pre-testing with a small group of patients and caregivers (n=15) to iteratively improve the app and ensure usability. Finally, we will compare the data collected via the app to that collected during routine clinical visits. Over a 9-month period, we will follow participants (n=30) with low-risk BCC who have selected an active surveillance option. We will collect data monthly through the app, and every 3 months through in-person clinic visits. We will evaluate patient satisfaction and clinical course to determine the feasibility of using a mobile app for active surveillance of low-risk BCC.

"SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations   The United States population is growing older. There is an urgent need for tools to better connect health professionals with their patients and perform at-home assessments in an automated fashion. The long-term goal of this proposal is to discover the knowledge necessary to enable an always-on, non-intrusive, non-wearable smart system for automated at-home gait parameter estimation using floor vibrations. To achieve this vision, the proposal has the objective of connecting health professionals with older adults living independently through a smart system that estimates gait parameters using floor vibration. The aims to achieve this goal are to 1) determine at-home gait parameters as a function of time and space; 2) establish a digital identifier of the older adult based on gait parameters; and 3) correlate changes in at-home gait parameters, after considering spatial-temporal correlations, with changes in the well-being of the resident. The proposed research will advance the state-of-the-art in engineering, physical therapy and public health by testing the following hypotheses: 1) Floor vibration is a viable means to automatically and continuously determine gait parameters; 2) For healthy individuals living in an independent at-home setting, gait parameters will be consistent based on location in the home, time of the day and day of the week; and 3) For patients recently discharged from the hospital, recovery will correlate with improvements in their gait parameters. The testing of the hypotheses will be performed through five tasks: 1) Develop an automated system to capture floor vibration and extract gait parameters; 2) Validate the system in laboratory setting; 3) Collect data at participant’s homes; 4) Test the hypothesis that at-home gait parameters are consistent with time and space; 5) Test the hypothesis that improvement in gait parameters correlates improvement in health status of recently discharged patients. This research will be pursued by a group of interdisciplinary researchers in engineering and physical therapy with the support of an experienced geriatric physician and will advance the knowledge in signal processing techniques, estimation and validation of at-home gait parameters and their uncertainty, and relationship between changes at-home gait parameters and changes in health status. The proposed activities will have a significant impact on older adult care, the research community and the next generation of researchers and engineers stemming from: 1) improved health of older adults and reduced health care cost by early intervening and thus decreasing the readmission rate; 2) increased scientific literacy and public engagement through benchmark problems, interdisciplinary seminars, new courses and outreach activities; 3) the training of diverse convergence researchers competent in solving interdisciplinary problems, including underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The proposed research aligns with the mission of National Institute of Aging by developing automated, non-intrusive, privacy-preserving at-home gait assessment tools based on floor vibrations to correlate changes of gait parameters with the health status of older adults. The outcomes of this project will enable health professionals to monitor the well-being of the older population and manage recovery paradigms thereby improving the health and well-being of older Americans.",SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations  ,10188392,R01AG067395,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Floor', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Professional', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Home', 'Hospitals', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical therapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'STEM field', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'privacy preservation', 'readmission rates', 'scientific literacy', 'signal processing', 'spatial relationship', 'stem', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,294904
"Polypharmacy, Potentially Inappropriate Medications, and Adverse Outcomes in Older Adults with Advanced Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Polypharmacy (PP), or the concurrent use of multiple medications, affects up to 80% of older adults with cancer. It is associated with the use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), which have risk greater than benefit in older adults. In older adults with cancer, PP/PIMs have been associated in some studies with adverse outcomes, including poor adherence to and tolerance of cancer therapy and decrease in physical functioning. However, these data have been inconsistent, and studies to date have examined specific populations (such as disease-specific subgroups enrolled in clinical trials) that may not be representative of the general population of older adults with cancer. This proposal presents a 2-year research and career development plan focused on examining a cohort (n=370) of older adults with advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy in community oncology clinics. This is a secondary analysis of the control arm of the Geriatric Assessment Intervention for Patients Aged 70 and Over Receiving Chemotherapy or Similar Agents for Advanced Cancer (“GAP”): Reducing Toxicity in Older Adults study (URCC 13059, principal investigator is primary mentor Dr. Mohile), describing prevalence and patterns of PP/PIMs as well as the relationship of PP/PIMs to adverse outcomes including relative dose intensity of chemotherapy (RDI, a ratio of received to standard doses of chemotherapy), chemotherapy toxicity, and functional trajectory. The candidate, Dr. Erika Ramsdale, is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Rochester and is board-certified in both Oncology and Geriatric Medicine. This proposal builds upon her prior systematic review of PP/PIMs in older patients with cancer, showing the limited data available in the literature, and her work demonstrating that PP/PIMs are associated with functional impairments in older adults with advanced cancer prior to initiating chemotherapy. The aims of the proposed study are: 1/to test the hypotheses that PP/PIMs rates will be higher than reported in most prior studies, and over-the-counter medications will comprise the majority of PIMs detected; 2/to examine the association of PP/PIMs and the following adverse outcomes in older adults with cancer starting chemotherapy: chemotherapy tolerability at 3 months (RDI, grade 3-5 chemotherapy toxicity), and functional decline over 3 months. An exploratory aim will also compare the performance of regression and other supervised classification methods to model and predict factors influencing chemotherapy toxicity, including PP/PIMs and functional status. The proposal describes a comprehensive mentorship and training plan to develop complementary skills and knowledge in in polypharmacy, quantitative analysis, and data science. Under the guidance of her primary mentor Dr. Supriya Mohile, co-mentors Dr. Holly Holmes and Dr. Martin Zand, and advisor Dr. Eva Culakova, she will advance her skills in these areas with the long-term goal of becoming an independent geriatric oncology researcher implementing and testing multi-level interventions to address polypharmacy in older adults with cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polypharmacy, or taking multiple concurrent medications, is very common in older adults with cancer receiving cancer treatment, and increases the risk of taking one or more medications which are “potentially inappropriate” based on having higher risk than benefit in older adults. Polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications may be associated with adverse outcomes such as chemotherapy toxicity and functional decline in older adults with cancer. This proposal will examine the prevalence of polypharmacy, patterns of medication use, and impact of polypharmacy on tolerability of cancer treatment and functional trajectory in older patients with advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy.","Polypharmacy, Potentially Inappropriate Medications, and Adverse Outcomes in Older Adults with Advanced Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy",10263984,R03AG067977,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Antihistamines', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Pharmacists', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Companions', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Holly', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical Performance', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Series', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'age related', 'aged', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'i(19)', 'impaired functional status', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'interest', 'older patient', 'professor', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'symposium', 'systematic review']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R03,2021,154000
"Development and Validation of a Prediction Model for Longitudinal Fall Risk in Older Adults ABSTRACT My goal is to establish myself as an independent biostatistical researcher who develops and validates prediction models that are critical to identifying older adults at high risk of adverse health outcomes using novel machine learning methodology. My passion for developing prediction models for health outcomes in older adults stems from my desire to help people, especially older adults who are vulnerable. I developed a machine learning method called Binary Mixed Model (BiMM) forest, which is particularly suited for developing prediction models for repeated measures of outcomes in older adults because it accommodates dynamic fluctuations over time which are common in aging (e.g., functional status). Environment: Wake Forest School of Medicine is a nationally-recognized leader in geriatric research and provides an outstanding environment for accomplishing my goals. Mentors: I have an excellent interdisciplinary mentoring team consisting of experts in aging, biostatistics and informatics who are dedicated to supporting me in completing the research and training aims proposed in this K25 grant. Training: I will complete activities aimed to address gaps in my training with the guidance of my mentoring team. My Training Objectives are to 1) acquire knowledge about gerontology and geriatrics, 2) deepen my understanding of missing data mechanisms and techniques, 3) learn about the appropriate use of electronic health record (EHR) data for research purposes, and 4) develop leadership, networking, communication and grant writing skills. To accomplish these objectives, I will attend conferences, seminars, journal club, case conferences and writing workshops, observe a geriatric clinician, and complete coursework. The K25 grant will allow me to extend previous training, which will provide me superior knowledge, experience and skills for my future as a biostatistical researcher in aging. Research: Early identification of older adults at-risk of falling is critical so that preventative care plans may be implemented to improve patient outcomes and reduce burden on the health care system. Most current prediction models cannot handle repeated measurements over time and have not been used with EHR data. I propose to use my BiMM forest method to develop a prediction model for fall risk over time. My Research Specific Aims are to 1) impute (fill in) missing predictor data in Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study with a novel machine learning method (BiMM forest); 2) develop a prediction model for identifying older adults at-risk for falls; and 3) assess the feasibility of using EHR data to externally validate the prediction model. The prediction model developed in this proposal will aid in identification of at-risk individuals for falls, allowing providers to intervene early to reduce the burden of falls for patients, caregivers and healthcare systems. Results from this grant will provide a basis for future R01 submissions to further validate the prediction model using EHR data from multiple health care centers and evaluate the clinical utility of the model in practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying older adults at-risk for falls is critical for implementing preventative interventions aimed at reducing adverse outcomes, but developing prediction models for fall-risk remains challenging due to analytic shortcomings, missing data, and limitations of electronic health record (EHR) data. This K25 Mentored Quantitative Research Development Award provides Dr. Jaime Lynn Speiser with essential training in aging, missing data methodology, EHR data analysis, and career development to facilitate her transition into an independent biostatistical researcher in aging.

"Transformative Solutions for Reducing Frequent 911 Fall Calls in the Homes of Patients with Cognitive Impairments PROJECT SUMMARY There is a global upsurge of falls in older adults that impacts nearly every family across the world. Millions of older adults fall each year in the United States, leading to catastrophic injuries, deaths and soaring healthcare costs. Over the last decade, 911 fall calls have tripled while transport rates to the hospital after a fall have significantly decreased. Instead, 911 is increasingly used for lift assists (falls that do not result in transport). Deployment of emergency medical services for lift assists diverts care from higher acuity emergencies and costs more than 200 million dollars annually in the United States. There is a potentially powerful yet underutilized solution if we leverage the hidden opportunities of fall events, such as lift assists that do not result in catastrophic consequences, to activate prevention strategies. This study aims to develop a scalable strategy for early identification of individuals at high risk of falls and activate prevention solutions. We hypothesize that a systematic 911 fall call intake which has a broader concept of frailty, Frailty And Cognition+Environment (FaCE), will better account for the compounding and cascading nature of fall risks in older adults. At the completion of this project a scalable machine learning model which incorporates FaCE factors to predict high utilization of 911 for falls will be developed. In addition, we will characterize barriers and facilitators for adoption, implementation, and maintenance of fall prevention strategies in the home for patients with FaCE risk factors. This project will utilize a blend of systems science and community-based participatory research approaches and state of the art predictive analytics to elucidate the FaCE of falls, develop a scalable fall prevention solution that can be implemented nationwide and inform a larger-scale implementation trial for using 911 fall calls to activate effective fall prevention strategies in homes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Healthcare costs for falls have reached 55 billion dollars annually in the US with falls in older adults impacting nearly every family, in every sector, of every community. Leveraging 911 fall calls as activation events could transform our ability to identify high risk individuals and significantly impact fall prevention strategies. At the completion of this study, a scalable EMS fall prediction tool will be developed to elucidate the impact that frailty, cognitive impairment and the home environment have on emergency fall events in order to activate and transform effective fall prevention solutions in the homes of vulnerable older patients.",Transformative Solutions for Reducing Frequent 911 Fall Calls in the Homes of Patients with Cognitive Impairments,10339728,K76AG068435,"['911 call', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Home', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intake', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Lifting', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'System', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'frailty', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'implementation trial', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'older patient', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'risk stratification', 'success', 'tool']",NIA,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K76,2021,242041
"electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS). ABSTRACT Recent meta-analyses have found that participation in the appropriate fall-prevention exercise program for an older adult reduces the risk of falls by 23% in relative terms, for an absolute reduction of 0.20 falls per person per year. Many guidelines, including the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), recommend that older adults at risk of falls are referred to appropriate fall-prevention exercise programs (USPSTF Level B). Despite this evidence, many older adults do not receive appropriate referrals and support for fall-prevention exercises, with one study finding that less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). Older people living in rural areas are more likely to fall but are less likely to participate in fall prevention programs. Advances in computing technology can help to identify older people at risk of falls and disseminate guidance about the most effective interventions using clinical decision support (CDS) systems. Patients can be supported in their exercise programs through a patient-focused App distributed through the PCP or through content on their patient portal. Well-implemented CDS that is integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) can support prescribing or recommending effective strategies and engaging patients in fall prevention decision-making thus integrating evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice. The long-term goal of our research program is to enhance the safety of community-based older adults by reducing falls through an effective patient-centered learning health system called eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS). With eSTEPS, an exercise algorithm will be integrated into the EHR which will trigger a Best Practice Alert (BPA) and Smart Set to provide actionable CDS within primary care clinic workflows and facilitate the use of CDS with patients to ensure evidence-based recommendations are tailored to patient preferences. The resulting fall prevention exercise care plan will be sent to the EHR as a note and to a patient-facing App for the patient to view after their visit. In this proposal we will use traditional fall risk screening and machine learning approaches to accurately identify older adults at risk for falls. We will then develop, CDS implemented into the electronic health record that helps primary care providers and older patients develop a tailored fall prevention exercise plan. We will conduct a cluster randomized control trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test the efficacy of the eSTEPS CDS intervention. Development of the eSTEPS CDS within the widely adopted Epic EHR will support dissemination of evidence for older adults, with a focus on rural elders. NARRATIVE There is substantial evidence that conducting multifactorial fall risk assessments and developing personalized prevention plans in primary care settings can reduce falls, but many barriers exist to integrating this evidence into practice. The US Preventive Service Task Force recommends fall prevention exercises for community- dwelling adults who are at increased risk for falls, however less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). The goal of this project is to develop, test, and evaluate shareable, standards-based fall prevention clinical decision support, eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS) that can used by primary care providers to facilitate personalized activity and exercise prescriptions and reduce falls in at risk older adults.",electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS).,10238835,R61AG068926,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Prevention Guidelines', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Screening procedure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavior change', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exercise prescription', 'exercise program', 'experience', 'fall injury', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'implementation protocol', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'patient portal', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'rural area', 'screening', 'smartphone Application', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R61,2021,243761
"Advanced Development and Utilization of Assembled Aging Trajectory Files from Multiple Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY This goal of this project is to create a unique and comprehensive research repository of aging trajectory da- tasets, related resources, and analytic methods that can be used to answer new and important questions in aging and related sciences. Specifically, by harmonizing and merging multiple data sets this project will gener- ate the data infrastructure needed to understand change over time in care settings, geriatric syndromes, physi- cal functioning, and shared risk factors at multiple levels (patient, provider, community, healthcare system, and society) and across multiple domains (biological, behavioral, sociocultural, and physical/built environments) including chronic conditions and history of acute illness such as COVID-19, exposure to air pollution, neighbor- hood socioeconomic, and health care system factors (Aim 1). Analytic strategies will be developed for user- defined cohorts and their propensity score-matched controls, e.g., older adults who were living with chronic conditions including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), diabetes, heart failure, end-stage re- nal disease, metastatic cancer, and HIV. State-of-the-art analytic methods are used to identify patterns of ag- ing trajectories (care setting, geriatric syndromes, physical functioning) experienced by older adults during the final years of life and their association with shared risk factors and distal outcomes (Aim 2). From the assem- bled trajectory file in Aim 1, cohorts are derived by aligning an originating index time such as age cutoff point and time at diagnosis (e.g., ADRD, stroke, chronic kidney disease). Both a model-based approach and ma- chine learning algorithms are then used to discover multilevel and potentially interactive predictors of trajecto- ries (e.g., rapid functional decline in independent living beneficiaries) and specific outcomes (e.g., respiratory ventilator usage among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with COVID-19) (Aim 3). The unique resources are then shared to disseminate resources including datasets, documentation, source code, and methodology (Aim 4). At the end of this project, the research infrastructure to investigate the relationship between shared risk factors and aging trajectories will be ready to use and replicate, giving investigators unprecedented ability to solve new challenges in aging science. This will allow researchers to understand the underlying processes and systems associated with reversible periods of disability across care settings, and interventions that may be used to support recovery of function and reduction of geriatric syndromes including cognitive decline, for the purpose of reducing burdensome care transitions, and maintenance of functional independence. This project will also create the resources and methods needed to evaluate the impact of innovations and interventions im- plemented at the patient, provider, community, healthcare system, and society/policy levels to improve care quality and outcomes for older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research infrastructure project will harmonize and merge multiple data sets needed to answer new and complex questions about the aging trajectories and health of diverse populations during the universal process of aging. This project will explore the interactions of shared risk factors across levels (patient, provider, com- munity, health care system, and society) and domains (biological, behavioral, sociocultural, and physical/ built environments) using state-of-the-art analytic methods.

"BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and shingles lead to significant rates of illness, hospitalization, and death among older adults. In the United States, vaccination rates have been mostly unchanged for a decade with lower rates among racial and ethnic minority groups. New and scalable approaches are needed to address this important public health issue. Nudges are changes to the way choices are offered or information is framed that can have outsized effects on behavior. For example, default options are the path of least resistance and the action that takes place if no alternatives are selected. Active choice is a method that prompts a decision-making now, rather than waiting for stakeholders to recognize the need to make the decision on their own. Our groups at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine) and the University of Washington (UW Medicine) have formed behavioral design teams embedded within the operations of our health systems and have demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, this scalable technology platform is an optimal environment to implement and deploy these types of nudges. In this study, we propose to design, test, and implemented personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target barriers among high-risk subgroups to improve vaccination rates. We will pilot this at two health systems and then implement a pragmatic trial at those health systems and sites in the VA Health System. In the R61 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine and UW Medicine. Aim 1: To use EHR data and analytical methods to identify high-risk groups of older adults with suboptimal vaccination rates for influenza, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster. Aim 2: To assess the feasibility of implementing different types of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target the identified groups to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 3: To pilot test ways to personalize promising nudges to clinicians and patients for improving vaccination among older adults. In the R33 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine, UW Medicine, and the VA Health System. Aim 1: To conduct a 12-month, multisite, cluster randomized, pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients relative to control to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing disparities in vaccination rates related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic factors. Aim 3: To evaluate heterogeneity in treatment effect across clinician, patient, and practice characteristics to further tailor approaches in future intervention design. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many older adults are at risk of illness, hospitalization, and death from vaccine-preventable diseases. Moreover, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in care with even lower vaccination rates among African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. In this study, we will use analytical methods to identify high-risk subgroups, test personalized nudges to address barriers among these groups, and then implement a pragmatic, multisite trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates among older adults and reduce disparities in care.",BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR,10238860,R61AG068945,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Asians', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Health Services', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Vendor', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Workload', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'ethnic minority population', 'health care disparity', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'multi-site trial', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'peer', 'personalized approach', 'pragmatic trial', 'prescription opioid', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'response', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'treatment effect']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2021,288540
"Sense4Safety: Supporting socially vulnerable older adults Abstract Falls and fall-related injuries are significant public health issues for adults 65 years of age and older. Over a third of older adults (OA) fall each year and 10-20% of falls result in serious injuries such as fractures and head trauma. The annual direct medical costs in the US as a result of falls are estimated to exceed $50 billion, and this estimate does not include the indirect costs of disability, dependence, and decreased quality of life. This project targets community dwelling OA with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are socially vulnerable. MCI is a leading risk factor for falls in OA. Approximately 15%-20% of OA have MCI, and over 60% of OA with MCI fall annually – two to three times the rate of those without cognitive impairment. Socially vulnerable OA living in low-resource neighborhoods with poor housing conditions have twice the risk of falling. We have developed an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk. The purpose of this study is to refine the Sense4Safety intervention based on extensive feedback by low income OA with MCI, their family members or trusted others and clinicians in order to ensure that the passive monitoring system to predict fall risk for OA with MCI can generate actionable and tailored information that can be used effectively by these stakeholder groups.

"Voice2Connect: Informing the Design of Smart Speakers for Social Connectedness in Low-Income Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract There is a growing public health concern regarding the high risk of social isolation and loneliness among low- income older adults and its resulting impact on their longevity and overall well-being. The issue of social isolation is particularly relevant to low-income senior housing (LISH) residents who often have multiple chronic conditions and disabilities, lack of financial and social resources, and limited social networks. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop innovative approaches to mitigate these issues in older adults living in LISH. Voice- operated smart speakers have the potential to reduce social isolation and loneliness in this population, for example, by connecting with other people, sending a reminder about social activities, or providing a conversational agent. The hands-free voice control provides improved accessibility and usability for people with low literacy, vision impairment, mobility limitation, or poor dexterity issues. We propose to examine how smart speakers can support the needs of social connectedness among older adults living alone in LISH. We will use an iterative user-centered design and employ a mixed-methods approach, incorporating participatory methods, focus group interviews, and functional and psychosocial health questionnaires. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to determine experiences of social isolation, user needs, user context, and preferences related to the use of smart speakers for social connectedness in the LISH setting, (2) to evaluate older adults (smart speaker users and non-users)’ and stakeholders’ attitudes towards the in-home use of smart speakers for promoting social engagement, with a focus on perceived usability and usefulness of the technology, and (3) to identify potential implementation barriers and privacy concerns among older adults and stakeholders. Stakeholders will include housing staff members (N=10) and health care professionals (N=6) providing wellness services to LISH residents. Older adults (N=36) will form six focus groups and take part in a series of three focus group sessions in which they participate in user-centered design activities to identify potential smart speaker features that can support the needs of social connectedness. Their thoughts and ideas will be used to develop low-fidelity prototypes and scenarios of use for each prototype. After prototype and scenario development, we will seek input from the older adults, housing staff, and health care providers through focus groups, which will be used to refine the prototype. The refined prototypes will be validated with the older adult participants. We will use a thematic analysis and inductive coding method to analyze focus group interview transcripts. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the questionnaire data collected from older adults and stakeholders. Findings from this study will inform our future research where we build smart speaker algorithms and functionalities that can facilitate the planning of innovative smart speaker-based social connectedness interventions for older adults in LISH. Project Narrative The proposed study aims to examine how smart speaker technologies can support the needs for social connectedness among older adults living alone in low-income senior housing communities. This study is highly relevant to public health as it represents an early exploration of what potential features and functionalities of smart speakers can address the issue of social isolation and loneliness in low-income senior housing residents.

"Novel Computed Tomography (CT) Imaging Biomarkers in Older Adults for Predicting Adverse Geriatric Health Outcomes Blood-based biomarkers have been widely used in studying various metabolic pathways contributing to aging, including energy metabolism, chronic inflammation, cellular senescence, and endothelial function. Like blood- derived biomarkers, imaging-based biomarkers can be evaluated as potential predictors of aging outcomes. For study of non-neurologic aging, biomarkers derived from computed tomography (CT) offer great promise. Recent advances in scanner technology and image processing mean that most CT examinations can be obtained in less than one minute, lowering participant burden. In addition, radiation doses have been lowered and the intra- and inter-scanner variability has improved. In parallel, machine learning tools allow for automated image processing and segmentation, increasing efficiency of image analysis, and reducing bias. For these reasons, CT is increasingly being used to study skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. On CT, muscle quantity is typically measured by cross-sectional area (CSA). Muscle quality is traditionally quantified by skeletal muscle density (SMD) and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) cross-sectional area. In addition to being a measure of muscle quality, IMAT may be considered as a measure of fat quantity. We recently developed and validated an automated machine learning tool to determine traditional CT measures of muscle and adipose tissue quantity and quality. To better characterize tissue quality, we have also applied ""radiomic"" texture analysis to muscle tissue on CT images. Texture analysis refers to the quantification of image voxel inter-relationships and provides a measure of tissue heterogeneity. To our knowledge, this technique has never been applied to CT images from community-based epidemiological studies. We propose to relate these CT-based assessments of muscle and adipose tissues to important geriatric outcomes, focusing on hip and other fractures as well as falls, physical performance, and strength. We will complete these analyses on archived CT images in MrOS (a prospective cohort study of healthy aging in older men, with a particular focus on osteoporosis) and Health ABC (a prospective cohort study of non-disabled Black and White older adults). Abdominal CT images were collected at the baseline exam for MrOS men in the United States (N~3700 in 2000-2), MrOS men in Hong Kong (N~400 in 2001-3), and Health ABC (N~3000 in 1997-8). Health ABC also collected CT images at the mid-thigh. In Health ABC, mid-thigh and abdominal CT images were repeated in a subset five years later (N~600 in 2000-3). We will add three aims: 1) test the hypothesis that that greater muscle and fat tissue heterogeneity features at the abdomen and mid-thigh are associated with increased risk of hip and other fractures, 2) test the hypothesis greater muscle and fat tissue heterogeneity features at the abdomen and mid-thigh are associated with lower strength and poor physical performance (walking speed and chair stands); their decline over time; and risk of falls, and 3) characterize changes in muscle and fat tissue heterogeneity features at the mid-thigh over 6 years. In this secondary data analysis project, we proposed to measure muscle and adipose tissue quality and quality with automated, machine learning algorithms on existing CT images previously collected as part of the MrOS and Health ABC studies. Further, we will derive novel, radiomic based measures of texture of muscle and adipose tissue, and relate all of these metrics to important adverse geriatric outcomes in older adults.",Novel Computed Tomography (CT) Imaging Biomarkers in Older Adults for Predicting Adverse Geriatric Health Outcomes,10303313,R21AG070804,"['Abdomen', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cell Aging', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Endothelium', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fracture', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hip Fractures', 'Hip region structure', 'Hong Kong', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intervention', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Obesity', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Performance', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'density', 'epidemiology study', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'healthy aging', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older men', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'radiomics', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'walking speed']",NIA,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R21,2021,213676
"Mechanisms, response heterogeneity and dosing from MRI-derived electric field models in tDCS augmented cognitive training: a secondary data analysis of the ACT study ABSTRACT There is a pressing need for effective interventions to remediate age-related cognitive decline and alter the trajectory toward Alzheimer’s disease. The NIA Alzheimer’s Disease Initiative funded Phase III Augmenting Cognitive Training in Older Adults (ACT) trial aimed to demonstrate that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with cognitive training could achieve this goal. The present study proposes a state of the art secondary data analysis of ACT trial data that will further this aim by 1) elucidate mechanism of action underlying response to tDCS treatment with CT, 2) address heterogeneity of response in tDCS augmented CT by determining how individual variation in the dose of electrical current delivered to the brain interacts with individual brain anatomical characteristics; and 3) refine the intervention strategy of tDCS paired with CT by evaluating methods for precision delivery targeted dosing characteristics to facilitate tDCS augmented outcomes. tDCS intervention to date, including ACT, apply a fixed dosing approach whereby a single stimulation intensity (e.g., 2mA) and set of electrode positions on the scalp (e.g., F3/F4) is applied to all participants/patients. However, our recent work has demonstrated that age-related changes in neuroanatomy as well as individual variability in head/brain structures (e.g., skull thickness) significantly impacts the distribution and intensity of electrical current induced in the brain from tDCS. This project will use person-specific MRI-derived finite element computational models of electric current characteristics (current intensity and direction of current flow) and new methods for enhancing the precision and accuracy of derived models to precisely quantify the heterogeneity of current delivery in older adults. We will leverage these individualized precision models with state-of-the-art support vector machine learning methods to determine the relationship between current characteristics and treatment response to tDCS and CT. We will leverage the inherent heterogeneity of neuroanatomy and fixed current delivery to provide insight in the not only which dosing parameters were associated with treatment response, but also brain region specific information to facilitate targeted delivery of stimulation in future trials. Further still, the current study will also pioneer new methods for calculation of precision dosing parameters for tDCS delivery to potentially optimize treatment response, as well as identify clinical and demographic characteristics that are associated with response to tDCS and CT in older adults. Leveraging a robust and comprehensive behavioral and multimodal neuroimaging data set for ACT with advanced computational methods, the proposed study will provide critical information for mechanism, heterogeneity of treatment response and a pathway to refined precision dosing approaches for remediating age- related cognitive decline and altering the trajectory of older adults toward Alzheimer’s disease. NARRATIVE This secondary data analysis leverages data from an Alzheimer’s Disease Initiative funded Phase III randomized clinical trial examining benefits of transcranial direct current stimulation paired with cognitive training to remediate age-related cognitive decline and alter trajectories toward Alzheimer’s disease. Using advanced neuroimaging-derived computational modeling and artificial intelligence-based machine learning methods, the study will determine the mechanisms underlying response vs. non-response to treatment in older adults and precision dosing parameters for optimizing treatment outcomes.","Mechanisms, response heterogeneity and dosing from MRI-derived electric field models in tDCS augmented cognitive training: a secondary data analysis of the ACT study",10170947,RF1AG071469,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CCL4 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dose', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Structure', 'System', 'Thick', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'age related', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive training', 'comorbidity', 'cranium', 'effective intervention', 'electric field', 'experience', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'sex', 'support vector machine', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,RF1,2021,2180958
"Harmonizing and Integrating Nursing Data into Multidisciplinary Datasets to Evaluate Hospital Care and Readmissions of Older Adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias Project Summary/Abstract Currently, in the United States, there are 5.8 million older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). Twenty-one percent of older adults with AD/ADRD have unplanned, and often preventable, hospital readmissions within 30-days, which are estimated to cost over $5.4 billion per year. The development of clinical data research networks (CDRN) and their large complex datasets including patient and clinical level data have led to the development of various models to predict readmissions. However, the existing models have not demonstrated adequate predictive capability. The opportunity to integrate nursing care plan (i.e., patient problems, goals, and interventions) to these large datasets can fill gaps and improve the accuracy of prediction models. The development of a research data infrastructure that supports the integration of nursing care plan data to CDRN datasets is therefore critical for understanding and improving interdisciplinary care aimed at reducing readmissions of older adults with AD/ADRD. In this project, we propose to expand the research infrastructure of the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium and Data Trust through the creation, for the first time, of a reusable and feasible data pipeline that will ultimately integrate key care plan data elements documented by nurses into the OneFlorida Data Trust. The long-term goal of our research program is to gain a deeper understanding of readmissions for the aging population with AD/ADRD through the availability of an expanded dataset with interdisciplinary data. We plan to carry out the following aims: Specific Aim 1 (R21 Phase): Develop and test a prototype pipeline for extracting, translating, and integrating problems and goals in nursing care plan data from the University of Florida (UF Health) into the statewide OneFlorida Data Trust. We will map the local vocabulary used to represent the two nursing data elements to nationally recognized terminology sets using natural language processing and have registered nurses validate the mapping results. We will then use automated scripts to replace the local vocabulary with the standardized terms and integrate the data into the Trust. Specific Aim 2 (R33 Phase): Convert and integrate into the Trust nursing interventions from UF Health. Specific Aim 3 (R33 Phase): Extract, convert, and integrate to the Trust nursing data from a second organization, using the pipeline from the R21 phase. Specific Aim 4 (R33 Phase): Construct and test readmissions prediction models for older adults (aged 65 and above) with AD/ADRD using pertinent variables from the Trust and environmental dataset linked to it. We will develop machine-learning models for predicting readmissions from the nursing care elements, other patient- level data in the Trust, and important environmental variables that influence post-discharge follow-up care. Our team will be among the first to develop sustainable data pipelines for transforming local nursing care plan data into standardized data for integration into a large dataset. Through this study, we will learn the improvements nurses, physicians, and other providers can make to prevent readmissions. Project Narrative We will expand a research infrastructure to support the integration of nursing care plan data to large complex datasets with patient and clinical level data. Through this expanded research infrastructure, we will be able to create predictive models with nursing, clinical, and environmental data for unplanned readmissions of older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias. We are confident that this study will be a model for the development of new research-data infrastructure and will allow us to learn the improvements nurses, physicians, and other providers can make to prevent readmissions.",Harmonizing and Integrating Nursing Data into Multidisciplinary Datasets to Evaluate Hospital Care and Readmissions of Older Adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias,10204503,R21AG072265,"['Ache', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical Care Team', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Care Plans', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Readmission', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Registered nurse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States', 'Universities', 'University resources', 'Vocabulary', 'age group', 'aged', 'aging population', 'application programming interface', 'care providers', 'clinical development', 'cost', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data pipeline', 'data standards', 'follow-up', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'model development', 'multidisciplinary', 'nursing intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'readmission rates']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2021,190625
"Utilizing Technology and AI Approaches to Facilitate Independence and Resilience in Older Adults The overarching goal of this application is to build an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Technology Collaboratory (AITC) ecosystem that will serve as a national resource to promote the development and implementation of novel AI and technology approaches to improve care and health outcomes for older Americans. The specific aims are: 1) To engage AI and geriatric/gerontology investigators from across the country and to identify, validate, test, and develop new AI and technologies relevant to improving the health and wellbeing of older adults through crucial pilot study mechanisms; 2) To serve as a national resource center that stimulates and leads the development and implementation of effective novel AI and technology approaches and products that will promote the health, wellbeing and independence of all older Americans; 3) To support the engagement of stakeholders in AI research; 4) To build an ecosystem of overlapping innovation and business, academic, and communities- of-practice networks ; and 5) To provide highest quality expertise, support, and infrastructure needed to disseminate technical and policy guidelines and best practices for effectively incorporating AI approaches and technology for older Americans, in partnership with private industry, angel investors, venture capital firms, and healthcare systems. This AITC is directed by a multi-PI interdisciplinary team led by two world-class experienced investigators who have long worked successfully in the fields of AI and technology development areas partnered with investigators who have long and successfully worked at the translational interface that connects real-world medical, cognitive, and functional declines that impact older adults with medical and technological solutions. Each of these investigators has a complementary skill set and a long track records of organizing transdisciplinary teams and consortiums of investigators around core themes. This interdisciplinary, accomplished, and highly visible leadership team will work together to develop vision for the next generation of AI in aging science and to build a scientifically and culturally diverse community of AI scholars and trainees around Aging. To achieve our goals, we designed the JHU AITC to have robust scientific and technological expertise that are described in eight core components. This infrastructure will support the implementation of stakeholder input and the identification of relevant technologies and investigators locally and nationally through a vetting and feasibility testing process of both technology and data processes. It will include a pilot testing phase and related oversight process. We have also established a key partnership with the Iowa office of Rural Health and Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers Leadership and with organizations within Johns Hopkins University that focus on improvements in the health and well-being of older adults in underserved urban communities. Connections with key academic, industry partners have also been established to accelerate the development of relevant technologies into products. This team is dedicated to developing the next AI scientific advances and disseminating resulting strategies into practice and policy that will maximize health, well-being, and independence for older adults. As the number of older adults increases, many older adults live with conditions that profoundly impact their health, well-being, and ability to maintain independence. Artificial Intelligence offers an unprecedented opportunity to mitigate the impact of aging, to arm health care providers with new tools and to empower older adults including those with Alzheimer’s Dementia and their caregivers. The Johns Hopkins AI and Technology Collaboratory ecosystem will serve as a national resource to promote and guide the development and implementation of novel AI and technology approaches to improve care and health outcomes for older Americans.",Utilizing Technology and AI Approaches to Facilitate Independence and Resilience in Older Adults,10274370,P30AG073104,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Businesses', 'Cancer Grant Supplements (P30)', 'Capital', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community of Practice', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Funding', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Iowa', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Movement Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Robot', 'Rural Community', 'Rural Health', 'Science', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urban Community', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Vision', 'Voice', 'Work', 'arm', 'clinical translation', 'collaboratory', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'functional decline', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'product development', 'programs', 'resilience', 'rural underserved', 'sensor', 'skills', 'speech processing', 'stakeholder perspectives', 'technology development', 'tool', 'trend', 'underserved rural area', 'urban area', 'urban underserved']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,P30,2021,4012350
"Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease (MAITC) PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall More than 90% of older Americans would prefer to stay in their homes as long as possible as they age. However, the prevalence of chronic illness including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (ADRD) can make the goal of successful aging at home out of reach without substantial support. At- home health care technologies hold significant promise to provide many needed forms of support, but have not been specifically developed for older adults, AD/ADRD patients, caregivers, and their clinicians. Many existing health monitoring technologies are burdensome to use for older adults, are not sufficiently accurate, have specific algorithmic biases, and lack adequate usability, and the resulting deluge of data often fails to provide information that can usefully inform caregivers and support clinical decisions. Further, many current treatment and intervention regimes are limited in terms of their ability to be remotely delivered, managed and adapted to patient needs and caregiver abilities over time. The Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease (MAITC) is a multidisciplinary Center spanning five sites – the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Brandeis University and Northeastern University – that aims to foster interdisciplinary research on the development, validation and translation of emerging AI- enhanced technologies to enhance connections between older adults, caregivers, and clinicians in order to more effectively support healthy aging as well as the care of patients with AD/ADRD at home. To achieve this objective, MAITC will pursue the five aims. The first is to apply a rigorous process which involves eliciting stakeholder needs to drive the foci of pilot studies and identifying promising technologies suitable for incorporation into pilot research projects. The second is to form and support a multidisciplinary community of engineers, computer scientists, behavioral scientists, medical researchers, nurses and clinicians working to advance the goals of the MAITC. The third is to provide access to state-of-art validation facilities, diverse cohorts across rural and urban areas, and translation and commercialization services to enable rapid, robust and multi-faceted validation and translation of AI-enhanced technologies. The fourth is to administer a pilot project granting process and ensure that the pilot projects are responsive to stakeholder needs, use emerging AI and related technologies that have significant potential to improve interactions between older adults, lay caregivers, and clinicians. The fifth is to provide training to developers, clinicians, and other stakeholders and to disseminate findings to diverse research, development and practice communities to accelerate further development of promising technologies and promote the adoption of validated technologies beyond the MAITC. Through these coordinated efforts, we hope to improve the lives of older adults and their caregivers. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease (MAITC) seeks to develop and validate health monitoring devices and artificial intelligence technologies to support healthy aging and Alzheimer's Disease care.

"Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network Extension for Socially Vulnerable Older Adults ABSTRACT The U.S. healthcare system cares for increasing numbers of older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, who require surgery with anesthesia. Regional social inequities, as measured by spatial indices such as area deprivation and social vulnerability indices, independently contribute to differences in perioperative and neurodegenerative outcomes. Data also support a significant association between neighborhood-level area deprivation indices with Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology. Despite emerging evidence linking social determinants of health with disparities in postoperative outcomes in older adults, investigations in these areas increasingly require expertise with disparate subject matters, including clinical perioperative practice, geriatrics, neuropsychology, social determinants of health, geospatial analyses, and even artificial intelligence. The K07 applicant is a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded independent investigator and fellowship-trained anesthesiologist with expertise in regional anesthesia and orthopedic surgery, as well as research experience in machine learning, geospatial disparities, and perioperative pain and cognition. The purpose of this proposal is to promote institutional and community awareness of how social vulnerabilities impact perioperative outcomes in older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and particularly those outcomes related to postoperative pain and cognition. The overall strategy of this proposal is to develop interdisciplinary research infrastructure along with transdisciplinary training programs to crosspollinate research teams. This structure will be organized via the Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network-Social Vulnerability (PeCANSV) construct in three aims: Aim 1: Convene a PeCANSV multidisciplinary advisory team to establish three supplemental cores in 1) geospatial infrastructure; 2) social determinants of health; 3) artificial intelligence. Aim 2: Accelerate research discovery through interdisciplinary research pathways by formalizing nascent linkages between supplemental PeCANSV cores and UF resources and extant geospatial, environmental, cognitive, and clinical perioperative databases at UF Health and throughout Florida. Aim 3: Develop a transdisciplinary workforce of clinical and basic science researchers to lead interdisciplinary teams addressing the social vulnerability of older adult surgical patients. Milestones include regular analysis of strengths, opportunities, aspirations, and results, interdisciplinary proposal submissions, and evidence of trainee success in perioperative research in social disparities of older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.  NARRATIVE The U.S. healthcare system cares for increasing numbers of older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, who require surgery with anesthesia. Regional social inequities, measured by spatial indices such as area deprivation and social vulnerability indices, independently contribute to differences in perioperative and neurodegenerative outcomes. Via the K07 mechanism and associated institutional support, the applicant will develop transdisciplinary research training and infrastructure involving geospatial data, social determinants of health, and artificial intelligence to address these challenges. This proposal will ultimately reduce disparities in postoperative outcomes in older adult surgical patients, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, with a particular emphasis on outcomes pertaining to postoperative pain and cognitive decline.",Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network Extension for Socially Vulnerable Older Adults,10281822,K07AG073468,"['Academic/Teacher Award', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Conduction Anesthesia', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electricity', 'Fellowship', 'Florida', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Geriatrics', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transportation', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'care systems', 'certificate program', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'curriculum development', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deprivation', 'disparity reduction', 'experience', 'frailty', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglect', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'postoperative recovery', 'programs', 'prospective', 'provider factors', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'sex', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social disparities', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'social vulnerability', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'symposium', 'unstructured data']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K07,2021,154739
"Understanding and Improving Inequities in Palliative Care for Older Adults with Advanced Dementia and Limited-English Proficiency: A Mixed-Methods Evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY Older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and limited-English proficiency (LEP) are at high risk of receiving suboptimal, goal-discordant care because of language and cultural barriers to effective communication about goals of care. Palliative care provides a way to improve quality of life and facilitate goal- concordant care by supporting effective person-family-clinician communication, but is under-utilized by older adults with Dementia and LEP and their families. No studies have sought to identify targets for intervention to address barriers to palliative care at multiple levels (i.e., patient/family, clinician, system, and community- levels) for this vulnerable population. Addressing this gap will be essential for the development of effective interventions to improve the quality of care for older adults with Dementia and LEP. The long-term goal of this work is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate interventions to facilitate culturally-sensitive palliative care for older adults with Dementia and LEP and their families. The rationale for this study is that before effective culturally- and linguistically-appropriate interventions to improve palliative care for older adults with Dementia and LEP can be developed, quantitative and qualitative data is needed to evaluate the scope of existing inequities and identify modifiable multi-level barriers to the delivery of high-quality palliative care for this population. Aim 1 utilizes quantitative methods to compare the quality of care received by decedents with advanced Dementia and LEP to those with English proficiency in four key palliative care domains (utilization of care, documentation of patient goals and preferences, symptom assessment, and circumstances of death) using EHR-based quality metrics and novel machine learning methods. Aim 2 utilizes qualitative interviews with key stakeholders (older adults with Dementia and LEP and their family members, caseworker-cultural mediators and interpreters, and clinicians and administrators) to identify modifiable targets for intervention across multiple levels. Aim 3 utilizes qualitative interviews with leaders of community-based organizations to assess community-level resources and capacity to support high quality palliative care for older adults with Dementia and LEP. Our interdisciplinary team is experienced in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia research, community engagement with LEP populations, and quantitative and qualitative methods. The proposal is innovative because it evaluates multi-level barriers to palliative care across three diverse LEP populations (Latinx, Chinese, and Vietnamese), and uses machine learning methods to evaluate the quality of care across several palliative care domains in a large health system. The proposed research is significant because these data will enable the identification and prioritization of multi-level targets for the development of culturally and linguistically-appropriate interventions to improve palliative care for older adults with Dementia and LEP. Ultimately, this work will advance a model of care that facilitates goal-concordant, high-quality care for older adults with Dementia and LEP and supports the palliative care needs of their family members. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it represents an innovative multi-level approach to identifying targets for effective interventions to improve the quality of care for older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and limited-English proficiency through improved palliative care. These results will enable the identification and prioritization of modifiable factors to inform effective and scalable strategies to facilitate goal-concordant care for this vulnerable population. The proposed research addresses the NIA's mission to eliminate disparities and improve the well-being of older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and their family caregivers.",Understanding and Improving Inequities in Palliative Care for Older Adults with Advanced Dementia and Limited-English Proficiency: A Mixed-Methods Evaluation,10300274,R01AG074253,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chinese People', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latinx', 'Limited English Proficiency', 'Linguistics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prognosis', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'advanced dementia', 'base', 'community engagement', 'disparity elimination', 'effective intervention', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'preference', 'sociodemographic factors', 'symptom management', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,693147
"Development of a Digital Cognitive Screening Test to detect Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia in Clinical Settings. Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a growing health problem in our aging population. Assessment of cognitive functioning for early detection is critical to identify individuals who might benefit from treatment with the available symptomatic medications for mild dementia as well as future disease-modifying therapies that are actively under development and being tested in clinical research trials. Current cognitive screening tools are time-consuming and not routinely used or documented in busy primary care settings. As a result, we need easily accessible tools, such as patient self-administered measures, to screen individuals in primary care settings to guide counseling, referrals, and interventions. The proposed STTR Phase I project aims to develop and test an innovative digital cognitive screening instrument, RIMCAT (Rhode Island Mobile Cognitive Assessment Tool) to identify mild cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults. RIMCAT consists of 10 components and was designed for self-administration in supervised settings such as primary care practices and provides a cognitive-friendly interface allowing voice inputs, keyboard typing, and easy-to-understand instructions. The goal of this STTR project is to examine the initial reliability and validity of RIMCAT through a psychometric study. The project also includes the development of a digital health framework to support the workflow of MCI/dementia screening. This work will establish the usability of RIMCAT among older adults who could undergo the screening assessment on a digital platform, regardless of their ability to use modern mobile technologies. Project Narrative This STTR Phase I proposal aims to develop and test an innovative digital cognitive screening instrument, to identify mild cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults. We will conduct a feasibility study to measure the initial reliability and validity of the instrument on 30 cognitively healthy older adults and 30 with cognitive impairment. We will develop a digital health framework to support the administration and scoring of RIMCAT in the current workflow.

"Individualizing Anticoagulant use in Older Adults with Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary/Abstract  This is a Beeson (K76) career development award for Sachin J Shah, MD, MPH, a physician-investigator trained in internal medicine, clinical epidemiology, and aging research. Dr. Shah is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Hospital Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Shah's long-term goal is to build evidence to individualize treatment recommendations for older adults facing high-risk, high-benefit therapeutic decisions using new epidemiologic methods and geriatric research principles. The decision to use anticoagulants in older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) is the paradigm of a high-stakes therapeutic decision because while anticoagulants prevent stroke, they increase the risk of bleeding complications. Guidelines use a one-size-fits-all approach; for older adults, they recommend near-universal anticoagulant use. In numerous studies of clinical practice, physicians report concern with the current approach voicing the need to individualize treatment recommendations for older adults. This proposal addresses the pressing need to individualize anticoagulant treatment decisions in older adults with AF through two aims. Aim 1: Develop and validate individualized estimates of the treatment effect of anticoagulants for ischemic stroke prevention in older adults with AF. This aim will use clinical trial and observational data to develop and validate a treatment effect model that will estimate individual-level treatment benefit. Aim 2: Ascertain functional outcomes after major extracranial hemorrhage, both short-term and longer-term. The functional outcomes following major hemorrhage, a key adverse event of anticoagulant therapy, are unclear, especially in older adults. Through two studies, this proposal will determine the short- and long-term functional outcomes following major hemorrhage.  Dr. Shah's exceptional, multidisciplinary mentoring team is led by Dr. Margaret Fang, nationally recognized for her work studying the clinical outcomes of anticoagulants in older adults and co-mentored by Dr. Kenneth Covinsky, whose nationally recognized research program has advanced our understanding of the predictors and outcomes of disability in older adults. This career development award will support Dr. Shah's transition to research independence through mentorship and focused training in (1) measuring heterogeneous treatment effects using novel epidemiologic tools, (2) primary data collection to build prospective cohorts of older adults, (3) designing decision aids and (4) leadership development to lead cross-disciplinary, multi-institutional research teams. This proposal will support a development grant to design and pilot a clinical decision tool for older adults considering anticoagulant and a project grant to measure heterogeneous treatment effects of procedural interventions in older adults with AF. The proposed research and training aims will provide Dr. Shah with the data, training, and experience to support competitive R-series applications. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder in older adults, and it substantially increases the risk of disabling strokes. Anticoagulant treatment reduces the risk of stroke but increases the likelihood of disabling bleeding events. We lack a way to individualize treatment decisions for older adults—this proposal will use multiple studies to better define the individual risk and benefits of anticoagulants in older adults with atrial fibrillation.",Individualizing Anticoagulant use in Older Adults with Atrial Fibrillation,10339189,K76AG074919,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Aging', 'Anticoagulant therapy', 'Anticoagulants', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cryosurgery', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Heart Atrium', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'investigator training', 'leadership development', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'professor', 'programs', 'side effect', 'stroke risk', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'trend']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K76,2021,243000
"Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in older adults (≥65y) is rising, and there is limited evidence-based guidance on treating these older adults. In older patients with multi-morbidity, treatment decisions should factor in not only risk of disease complications, but also treatment complications and non-IBD, extra-intestinal complications. Hence, to inform optimal treatment approach, a comprehensive assessment of comparative effects of different therapies on all of these outcomes is warranted. Existing single-center observational studies are limited by small sample size, and missing data due to fragmented health care, whereas administrative claims-based studies are limited by lack of detailed clinical data; these limitations can be overcome by linking the two data sources. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Siddharth Singh proposes to: (Aim #1.1) characterize disease burden and treatment patterns, (Aim #1.2) assess and predict risks of death, disease, treatment and extra-intestinal complications using machine-learning algorithms and (Aim #2.1) compare overall effectiveness and (Aim #2.2) safety of different treatment strategies in older patients with IBD. This will be studied using a highly innovative informatics-based approach in a multi-site, electronic medical record (EMR)-based cohort of older patients with IBD, linked to their corresponding Medicare claims. The EMR-based cohort will facilitate phenotyping and disease severity assessment, and linkage to Medicare claims will augment exposure and outcome ascertainment, overcoming challenges of fragmentation of healthcare and short follow-up. The central hypothesis is that, that older adults have systematically different risk profiles than younger adults, and using biologic monotherapy is a safer and more effective approach to treating IBD, as compared to using long-term corticosteroids alone, non-biologic immunomodulator monotherapy, and combination therapy of biologics and immunomodulators. The access to the advanced infrastructure of pSCANNER (Patient-centered Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research), one of 13 PCORI-funded Clinical Data Research Networks, and entire Medicare database, in a highly supportive and conducive environment at UCSD, with cross-disciplinary mentorship by a collaborative and experienced team of mentors and advisors from diverse backgrounds (clinical informatics, comparative effectiveness research, IBD therapeutics) is a key strength of this application. Besides directly informing clinical practice on treatment approaches in older patients with IBD, this proposal will enhance the career of the candidate by providing unique skills in applied clinical informatics, privacy-preserving record linkage techniques, predictive analytics, and comparative effectiveness research, and create a multi-institutional, EMR- based cohort of well-characterized IBD patients, linked with Medicare claims. This will ultimately contribute to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career focusing on comparative effectiveness research and population health management using novel informatics-based approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The information on comparative effectiveness and safety of different therapies in the context of patients' risk profile generated using this novel informatics-based approach in a unique linked EMR-Medicare database, will directly inform treatment of older patients with IBD, and enhance comparative effectiveness research methods.",Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,10144995,K23DK117058,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunomodulators', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Thromboembolism', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative safety', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health management', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'privacy preservation', 'risk minimization', 'risk prediction', 'skills', 'treatment risk', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K23,2021,203990
"Prognostic Implications of Home-Based Blood Pressure Monitoring in Older Adults Hypertension affects over 85% of adults over 75 years of age and represents one of the few modifiable risk factors to prevent dementia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in older adults. However, current practice guidelines for hypertension screening and treatment focus heavily on blood pressure (BP) measurements obtained in clinic settings. This reliance on brick-and-mortar offices for BP measurement represents a significant barrier for older adults, who often depend on others for transportation and who are at increased risk of severe morbidity from the current COVID-19 pandemic. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) has shown incredible promise for more effective and timely BP treatment and control. Furthermore, the current pandemic has catalyzed widespread adoption of HBPM for hypertension screening and management. However, evidence for this practice is severely lacking in older adults. In fact, there are virtually no HBPM cohort studies in elderly populations in the United States. This is particularly concerning as the discordance between clinic and home BP increases with age, making older adults especially susceptible to harms from either overly aggressive or delayed BP treatment. In this proposed study, we apply our unique expertise with HBPM and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to one of the most long-standing and well-respected American cohorts of community-dwelling adults, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC). While ARIC already rigorously measures BP in the clinic setting via automated devices, our proposal will additionally assess 8 days of HBPM and 24 hours of ambulatory BP (once every 20 minutes) in 2,142 racially diverse adults over age 80 years, establishing possibly the largest prospective study of home, ambulatory, and clinic-based BP measurement among older adults in the world. This proposal is designed to directly inform clinical practice with HBPM by characterizing its measurement performance (bias and variance), predictiveness with respect to key long-term events (dementia and CVD), and interpretation (i.e. what a home BP measure equals in terms of BP measured by ABPM or in clinic). The accomplishment of this proposal will address critical gaps in knowledge related to an increasingly utilized form of BP measurement, improving access to timely hypertension care by establishing an efficient protocol for precise BP measurement at home. Moreover, by investing in the digital monitoring platform of the ARIC study, this proposal will lay the foundation for remote collection of a wide range of detailed, longitudinal, biosensor data that can be leveraged by many investigators through subsequent ARIC proposals in years to come. With current trends in BP control worsening among older adults in the United States, there has never been a greater need for research on innovative technologies to improve access to high quality BP measurement. Ultimately, our proposal directly answers the call by NHLBI's 2017 expert panel on BP measurement for high impact research that determines “the role of ABPM and HBPM in the diagnosis…of hypertension” and “the optimal protocol for using HBPM…to diagnose and assess…hypertension.” High blood pressure is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for dementia and cardiovascular disease among older adults in the United States; however, clinic-based blood pressure measurement is inaccessible to many older adults, especially in the COVID-19 era, often delaying hypertension diagnosis and treatment. While home- based blood pressure measures show promise for overcoming access barriers and promoting more timely treatment, there is a dearth of evidence informing the clinical interpretation of these measurements inolder adults in the United States, a population characterized by high blood pressure variability and discordance from clinic- based blood pressure. Our proposal will perform home blood pressure monitoring and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring assessments in over 2,100 community-dwelling adults, aged 80-100 years, establishing the measurement performance, prognostic utility (for dementia and cardiovascular disease), and clinical interpretation of home-based blood pressure measurements in this vulnerable population in the United States.",Prognostic Implications of Home-Based Blood Pressure Monitoring in Older Adults,10273144,R01HL158622,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'American', 'Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities', 'Biosensor', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home', 'Home Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Improve Access', 'Intervention Trial', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Transportation', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'aged', 'aggressive therapy', 'aging population', 'base', 'blood pressure intervention', 'blood pressure regulation', 'blood pressure variability', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'modifiable risk', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic performance', 'prognostic value', 'racial diversity', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'tool', 'transportation access', 'trend', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,820661
