"CNS Deficits:  Interaction of Age and Alcoholism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Hazardous alcohol use has grown substantially in the aging population. It remains unknown whether Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and its alcohol-related cognitive and brain decline increases risk for diagnostic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or even can result in classic irreversible dementia. Motivating the proposal are 1) our longitudinal findings of accelerated aging of selective brain structures in AUD; 2) results of an animal model of high alcohol exposure in old compared with young, well-nourished male and female rats; and 3) preliminary results from non-alcoholic individuals meeting MCI criteria compared with AUD with similar extent of cognitive deficits revealing different age-related patterns of brain degradation. The findings led us to consider factors of nutritional deficiency and cytokine dysregulation that occur in both AUD and MCI and have the potential to contribute to common and unique disruption, accelerated by aging, of selective brain circuitry and cognitive sequelae in each diagnosis. We will test 180 actively drinking men and women (60 AUD, 60 non-alcoholic MCI, and 60 age-matched controls) before and after 18-24 months with structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Recognizing mnemonic compromise associated with AUD and MCI, primary hypotheses will target the integrity of nodes and connections of Papez (limbic) circuit; white matter integrity will be assessed with deterministic fiber tracking and node-to-node integrity with probabilistic fiber tracking. Causal modeling will test the influence of specific independent variables of alcohol, nutrition, age, and sex hypothesized to have direct effects on inflammation and thalamic-hippocampal or cingulate-entorhinal connectivity, which, in turn, exert mediating influences on episodic memory. In addition to quantification of alcohol use and nutritional and inflammatory markers, modifiable risk factors to be examined include smoking, licit and illicit drugs, obesity-BMI, blood pressure, and physical activity. The parallel animal study will focus on the interaction of alcohol binge exposure and nutritional challenge with graded levels of thiamine deficiency and resulting cytokine, brain structure and connectivity, and behavioral sequelae in rats. AIM 1: In cross-sectional study, model for each diagnosis the influence of independent variables (i.e., alcohol, nutrition, age, and sex) and hypothesized mediating factors (i.e., inflammation) affecting neurocircuitry substrates of episodic memory. AIM 2: In longitudinal study, use trajectory analysis to quantify interim change in targeted neurocircuitry as a function of age. Causal modeling will use longitudinal change data of the independent variables. AIM 3: In longitudinal study, determine whether nutritional (thiamine) deficits are sufficient to produce enduring MR-detectable responses to high blood alcohol levels in wild-type Wistar rats. PROJECT NARRATIVE Among the aging population it remains unknown whether Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and its alcohol-related cognitive and brain decline increases risk for diagnostic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or even can result in a classic irreversible dementia. Characterization of brain pathology and its relation to cognitive deficits in AUD compared with MCI and identification of modifiable risk factors may provide biological markers and enhance mechanistic understanding of these disorders. Development of a translational animal model of AUD brain pathology will permit discovery of biological factors in addition to alcohol itself that contribute to brain damage and inform intervention and treatment efforts for reversing pathology and impairment.",CNS Deficits:  Interaction of Age and Alcoholism,10233735,R01AA005965,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol Nutrition', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Controlled Study', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Episodic memory', 'Ethanol', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Fibrinogen', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Memory impairment', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensory', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thiamine', 'Thiamine Deficiency', 'Visuospatial', 'Wistar Rats', 'Woman', 'age related', 'aging population', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol use disorder', 'brain circuitry', 'causal model', 'cingulate cortex', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'drinking', 'entorhinal cortex', 'inflammatory marker', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'meetings', 'men', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'neural circuit', 'non-alcoholic', 'nutrition', 'recruit', 'response', 'sex', 'sex risk', 'skills', 'white matter']",NIAAA,SRI INTERNATIONAL,R01,2021,823091
"CNS Effects of Alcohol:  Cellular Neurobiology Abstract Overall    The  Alcohol  Research  Center  of  The  Scripps  Research  Institute  (TSRI-­ARC)  proposes  to  continue  its  interdisciplinary  program  focused  on  the  theme  of  the  central  nervous  system  effects  of  alcohol.  For  this  renewal  application,  the  TSRI-­ARC  (P60)  will  consist  of  9  components,  including  3  Cores  (Administrative,  Animal  Models  and  Information  Dissemination)  and  5  Research  Projects  (Molecular,  Neurophysiology,  Neurocircuitry, Neurochemistry, and Clinical). The overall hypothesis of the TSRI-­ARC as an integrated whole  is that the central stress systems become activated during the withdrawal/negative affect stage and persist into  protracted  abstinence  (in  the  preoccupation/anticipation  stage),  and  such  neuroadaptive  changes  associated  with  chronic  drinking  also  produce  an  evolving  set  of  neurobehavioral  symptoms  that  include  hypohedonia,  anxiety, irritability, negative affect, hyperarousal, and sleep disturbances, all of which contribute to relapse and  impede  recovery.  The  specific  subhypotheses  are:  1)  The  transition  from  acute  withdrawal  to  protracted  abstinence  includes  compulsive-­like  responding  for  ethanol  and  negative  emotional  behavior  that  involves  changes in interconnected brain areas: the extended amygdala, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the anterior  insula.  2)  The  altered  activity  in  these  circuits  reflects  actions  of  stress-­related  system  including  glucocorticoids,  serotonin,  hypocretin,  and  corticotropin-­releasing  factor.  3)  Cellular  neuroadaptations  are  associated  with  altered  dynamics  of  the  microtubule  cytoskeleton,  which  may  in  turn  mediate  the  structural  remodeling of neuronal dendrites. 4) Novel neurobiological targets identified by the TSRI-­ARC will significantly  attenuate  the  reinstatement  of  compulsive-­like  alcohol  seeking,  excessive  drinking,  and  anxiety-­like  behavior;;  and 5) drug candidates for these targets will be active in a human lab model of protracted abstinence where  they  will  reduce  drinking,  craving,  negative  affect,  and  executive  function  deficits.  We  believe  the  proposed  innovative  approaches  for  testing  these  hypotheses  will  provide  valuable  insight  into  novel  approaches  for  treating alcoholism and relapse in the humans.     The TSRI-­ARC also supports the Center at Large, which includes: 31 R01s, 10 R21s, 3 U01s, 1 U24, 2 R37s,  2  R13s,  and  one  T32  NIAAA  training  grant  associated  with  this  grant.  Members  of  the  Center  at  Large  have  access  to  the  Cores  of  the  TSRI-­ARC,  the  NIAAA  Integrative  Neuroscience  Initiative  on  Alcoholism  (INIA)  Consortia. Training and information dissemination to the San Diego community will be effected by the training  opportunities of the Center including a T32 NIAAA training grant and the Information Dissemination Core.  Narrative    This  Center  proposes  to  continue  its  interdisciplinary  program  focused  on  the  theme  of  the  central  nervous  system’s  effects  of  alcohol.  Dysregulation  in  the  brain  stress  system  mediates  the  transition  from  acute  withdrawal to protracted abstinence to promote vulnerability to relapse, and our ARC is designed to translate  our  discoveries  of  preclinical  TSRI-­ARC  studies  for  potential  therapeutic  use  using  proof-­of-­concept  human  laboratory testing. We believe this project will provide valuable insight into novel approaches for understanding  and treating alcoholism in the human population.

"Alcohol: A Modifiable Risk Factor for Ataxia and Decline in MCI ABSTRACT The overarching aim of this proposal, which is in response to PA-20-185, asks whether alcohol use exacerbates the motor and cognitive deficits of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (cross-sectionally), and whether drinking accelerates progression of MCI toward dementia (longitudinally). The answers have implications for harm reduction, especially if ""non-hazardous levels"" of alcohol consumption prove to be deleterious to individuals with MCI, in terms of postural stability and risk of falling that can affect activities of daily living and quality of life. We propose three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Test cross-sectional and longitudinal relations between drinking rates and static balance and dynamic gait in MCI and control men and women. Hypothesis: Higher rates of alcohol use will be associated with greater instability and slower gait in MCI compared with lower drinking MCI and controls matched in age, sex, and alcohol consumption variables. Hypothesis: At follow-up, accelerated cognitive decline in those with MCI will be predicted by slower natural gait and greater alcohol consumption compared with MCI with faster gait and lower alcohol consumption. Specific Aim 2: Use causal modeling to test multi-factorial determinants of static and dynamic stability metrics: alcohol consumption, sex, sensory physiology, cognitive performance, hematological measures of nutrition, physical and cognitive activities history, and activities of daily living (ADL). Hypothesis: Cross-sectionally, factors related to greater instability in MCI will be greater alcohol consumption, poorer sensory testing, and markers of poorer nutrition. In turn, these biomarkers of compromised function will predict poorer ADLs and quality of life. Hypothesis: Longitudinal measures will confirm cross-sectional relations and identify metrics that track standing instability, gait slowing, poorer ADL, and decline toward dementia with greater alcohol consumption. Specific Aim 3: Identify brain mechanisms of instability factors identified with causal modeling. Hypothesis: Factors related to greater imbalance and gait slowing identified with causal models will be related to smaller and compromised cerebello-pontine-motor cortical nodes and circuitry, whereas factors defining cognitive and mnemonic status will be related to smaller limbic and parietal volumes and diminished integrity of related circuitry. Both the balance and cognitive relations will be mediated by alcohol consumption rates. Hypothesis: Longitudinal analysis will reveal that these relations are enduring. Further, greater rates of alcohol consumption in the testing interim will result in accelerated functional decline in stability, gait speed, and cognitive status and cerebello-pontine-cortical circuitry. Exploratory analysis will use hypothesis-free, data-driven, in-house machine/deep learning methods to seek reliable constellations of factors that predict postural instability, gait impairment, and biomarkers of falling. NARRATIVE The aging of America together with escalating age-related cognitive decline and increasing alcohol drinking in older men and women signals an urgency to investigate the role of alcohol use in exacerbating cognitive decline toward dementia and postural instability as risk for falls attendant morbidity and mortality. Outcomes of this research have the potential to confirm alcohol consumption as a modifiable risk factor for dementia and for standing and walking instability, thereby providing justification for implementing balance, cognitive, and alcohol assessment in treatment settings and for creating protective strategies to enhance postural stability in standing and walking.",Alcohol: A Modifiable Risk Factor for Ataxia and Decline in MCI,10313396,R01AA010723,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Americas', 'Ataxia', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cerebellopontine', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Equilibrium', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Harm Reduction', 'Hematology', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Nutritional', 'Outcomes Research', 'Parietal', 'Physiological', 'Pontine structure', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol measurement', 'causal model', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive performance', 'deep learning', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'drinking', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'hazardous drinking', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'men', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'motor deficit', 'nutrition', 'older men', 'older women', 'posture instability', 'potential biomarker', 'response', 'sensory system', 'sex']",NIAAA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,232000
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal AlcoholExposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal AlcoholExposure,10174601,U01AA014809,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', '3D ultrasound', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Neonatal', 'Nose', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy', 'Preparation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Syndrome', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age group', 'alcohol exposure', 'algorithm development', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'caudate nucleus', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'handheld equipment', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse model', 'multi-ethnic', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'operation', 'postnatal', 'potential biomarker', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'tobacco exposure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,U01,2021,225264
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,10169172,U24AA014811,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,428830
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention. Project Narrative This project is directly relevant to public health concerns related to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and improved identification of alcohol-affected individuals with novel electronic data collection techniques. Improved identification methods and delineation of features related to alcohol-exposure will ultimately lead to improved treatment and help alleviate the public health burden associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,10169177,U01AA014834,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated with Prenatal Alcohol Exposure', 'Neuropsychology', 'Online Systems', 'Outpatients', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Ukraine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'classification trees', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first grade', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mobile application', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'population based', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,371197

The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention. Project Narrative This project is directly relevant to public health concerns related to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and improved identification of alcohol-affected individuals with novel electronic data collection techniques. Improved identification methods and delineation of features related to alcohol-exposure will ultimately lead to improved treatment and help alleviate the public health burden associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,10435674,U01AA014834,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated with Prenatal Alcohol Exposure', 'Neuropsychology', 'Online Systems', 'Outpatients', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Ukraine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'classification trees', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first grade', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mobile application', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'population based', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,75023
"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Data Analysis Resource will provide analysis of longitudinal data provided by this renewal to determine the extent to which structural and functional deficits in neurodevelopmental maturation precede, are caused by, or are exacerbated by initiation of appreciable alcohol use in adolescence.",NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE,10187466,U24AA021697,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Heart Rate', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality Control', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Saccades', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Visit', 'alcohol consequences', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol expectancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'binge drinking', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'data submission', 'drinking', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'informatics infrastructure', 'information processing', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,SRI INTERNATIONAL,U24,2021,1025354
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,10169180,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diagnostic platform', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2021,344735
": Complex systems analysis of the impact of alcohol on bone in non-human primates PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol’s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol is an important nonessential component of diet that has been implicated in having both positive and negative effects on the skeleton.

"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data Abstract Transdermal alcohol biosensors offer a promising method for unobtrusively collecting continuous alcohol levels in naturalistic settings over long periods of time. Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. More broadly, the software can be integrated with personal health monitoring systems for general public use and provide easily interpreted personalized alcohol consumption feedback.",Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data,10132950,R01AA026368,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Biosensor', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Concentration measurement', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffuse', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol response', 'alcoholism therapy', 'base', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'data reduction', 'diaries', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'physiologic model', 'population based', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'supervised learning', 'time interval', 'time use', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,500906

The goal of the R01 parent study is to produce software to convert transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) data into estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (eBrAC/eBAC). Devices are now available to reliably measure TAC, the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of BrAC/BAC across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The anticipated result of this R01 study is the development of the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. This Supplement will focus on aspects of Aims 2 and 3 of the parent R01, specifically Aim 2b: to examine alternative options for calibrating the models developed by the mathematics team, and Aim 3: to package the models into the BrAC Estimator software program that can be used by non-mathematicians. During the time of this Supplement award, we will collect data on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and two laboratory drinking sessions. We also will have 20 researchers and clinicians run our software to process field trial data to determine the ease of its use in research and clinical settings. Ms. Walden will assist with these data collection efforts. In addition, she will receive broader training a) in alcohol theory and real-time (laboratory and field) alcohol research design from mentor/PI Luczak, b) in the basics of mathematical modeling approaches, data integration/consolidation, and MATLAB coding basics from MPI Rosen and Co-I Wang, and c) from Co-Is and research staff on the parent R01 in their given areas of expertise, and d) in preparing first-author manuscripts and presenting her research at conferences. She will use the data she has helped collect to develop her independent research in her first and second years of graduate school. This research is not redundant with the originally proposed outcomes of this R01 study, yet is within the study’s scope. We will extend this master’s level research into her dissertation in her third and fourth years of graduate training as part of an F31 award application. This supplement is appropriate for Ms. Walden’s stage of research development and will contribute intellectually to the R01 research, enhance Ms. Walden’s research skills and knowledge, and provide opportunities for her career development to become a productive researcher who makes substantial and meaningful contributions to the field of alcohol research.

Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,10201416,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '3-Dimensional', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data fusion', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,509663
"Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Risky drinking, such as binge (5+/4+ drinks per 2-hour occasion for males/females) and high-intensity (2-3x the rates of binge) drinking, is highly prevalent among young adults and associated with severe acute and longer-term negative behavioral and health outcomes. However, given its prevalence, individuals who engage in such activities comprise a heterogeneous group. Researchers have had a hard time identifying the varied behavioral processes that are predictive of negative alcohol-related consequences and problematic trajectories across time. Predicting who will go on to develop lasting problems and whose risky alcohol use behavior is developmentally-limited is especially challenging. Part of the hindrance comes from the methods that are currently used to study this diverse behavior. In particular, researchers often use cross-sectional studies to look across individuals. While this has reaped invaluable knowledge regarding differences among individuals in their drinking patterns, it does not reveal the dynamic processes that contribute to maintaining such behaviors or make one more likely to have negative consequences. However, increasingly hypotheses pertain to these dynamic processes. This requires arriving at quantitative descriptions of individuals' emotional and behavioral processes. The science can move towards a more nuanced understanding of the varied mechanisms contributing to problematic alcohol use by arriving at valid descriptions of individual-level (i.e., personalized) processes. We propose to make advances towards personalized quantitative models in four ways: 1) develop an informed intensive longitudinal research design that enables acquisition of relevant variables across time on a daily basis and across the span of one year; 2) use innovative measurement technologies that enable objective assessment of contextual features related to drinking; 3) collect data using state-of-the-art phone applications that enable self-report and passive data collection where the user does not need to interface; and 4) implement cutting- edge machine learning algorithms that can reliably arrive at individual-level detection and predictive models that can be used as the foundation for future just-in-time adaptive interventions. We will accomplish this by enrolling N=300 young adult risky drinkers who will complete a 120-day ambulatory assessment protocol completing surveys on smartphones that are also equipped with passive sensors and applications, and then provide 4 waves of data on alcohol use and associated variables (e.g., consequences) over one year. In the end, our endeavors will create novel approaches to measuring and modeling behavioral processes related to high-risk drinking that capture the individuality of each participant. These endeavors will provide the framework for accurate detection and prediction of daily drinking and long-term problematic alcohol use trajectories that support future scientific and clinical efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Risky drinking behavior (i.e., episodic binge and high-intensity drinking), which peaks in young adulthood, is estimated to account for more than 40,000 deaths annually and over $167 Billion in economic costs in the United States. Young adult risky drinkers are a heterogeneous group, which makes them very difficult to study and to predict who will go on to develop lasting problems with alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. This research will implement cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and apply them to data collected from daily surveys and passive smartphone sensors in young adult risky drinkers to develop personalized models of problematic alcohol use.",Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use,10147835,R01AA026879,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Bluetooth', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Models', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vehicle crash', 'Violence', 'adaptive intervention', 'alcohol behavior', 'alcohol related consequences', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'bench to bedside', 'binge drinking', 'craving', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'economic cost', 'emotion regulation', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high intensity drinking', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'smartphone based assessment', 'social', 'social group', 'working group', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,628338
"Developing a mobile alcohol biosensor platform for use in medication testing research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will enable Dr. Roberts to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher working to develop pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This proposal outlines a 5-year training plan that supports a research program focused on developing a mobile biosensor platform for tracking medication effects on alcohol reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Training domains include 1) mobile biosensor assessment of alcohol use, 2) management and analysis of biosensor data, and 3) AUD pharmacotherapy development research. The training plan includes a strategic combination of mentor-led trainings; coursework in mobile health sensing, data science, statistics, bioethics, clinical research methods, and grant writing; attendance at relevant conferences and workshops; and collaboration with investigators conducting research in AUD pharmacotherapy development. The candidate will complete these training activities while completing a research program aimed at developing a mobile biosensor platform that can passively track alcohol consumption and deliver conditional assessments at key points during drinking episodes. In these preliminary studies, heavy drinkers with AUD will wear the mobile biosensors and receive alcohol in the laboratory. In Experiment 1, participants will receive two fixed doses of alcohol while wearing the biosensors and responding to prompted assessments. Goals of this experiment will be to 1) refine the machine-learning derived detection algorithms that will identify key points during drinking episodes and 2) evaluate the user experience and feasibility of delivering prompted assessments on a smartphone during drinking episodes. Experiment 2 will test the detection algorithms in a separate sample of freely behaving participants engaged in self-paced alcohol drinking. Results of these studies will serve as pilot data to support an R-mechanism application to develop a formal paradigm using the biosensor platform to track medication effects of alcohol use and reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Dr. Roberts has assembled an mentorship committee of leaders in the field. Dr. McKee (primary mentor) is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale University. She applies innovative laboratory paradigms to AUD pharmacotherapy development research, and she has several lines of research using mobile health biosensors to track substance use behavior. Dr. Ramchandani (primary co-mentor) is a clinical investigator and Chief of the Human Psychopharmacology Section at the NIAAA intramural research program. He will lead Dr. Roberts's training in alcohol pharmacokinetics. Drs. Gueorguieva, Petrakis, and Gerstein will serve as secondary mentors and contribute to Dr. Roberts's training in longitudinal data analysis, AUD pharmacotherapy clinical trials, and machine learning and data science, respectively. Drs. Miranda and Barnett will serve as external advisers and support Dr. Roberts's training in ambulatory assessment in the context of medication development research and transdermal alcohol detection, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder is a potentially disabling disease with a large economic and health burden in the United States.

"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials PROJECT SUMMARY Pharmacological and behavioral treatments of alcohol use disorder are only useful to the extent that their effects are robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps to maximizing scientific reliability; however, it has historically been largely overlooked in the health sciences. Alcohol researchers are increasingly utilizing complex statistical models (e.g., growth curves, mixture models, social networks); yet, accessible methods for sample size determination for all but the simplest statistical tests have not been broadly disseminated. Moreover, even for models in which software programs are readily available, scientists consistently express uncertainty regarding expected parameter estimates, prohibiting the utility of power analysis itself. As a result, many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are likely not optimally designed to allow for conclusive statistical inference. The overall objective of this proposal is to close this gap by developing a generalized method for power analysis using a combination of established and innovative approaches that can be used to generate and test a vast array of models used in treatment research. This objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: develop a flexible, user-friendly software interface for statistical power and sensitivity analysis (Aim 1); and develop a generalized framework for determining model parameter estimates (Aim 2). The proposal is innovative because the software interface will be grounded in state-of-the-art advancements in computational technology and human-computer interaction. In addition, the framework will be fortified by advances in generalizability-theory-based meta-analyses and guided walk and machine-learning-based simulation studies investigating the effects of uncertainty in individual model parameters on the likelihood of observing hypothesized effects. The software will include automated sensitivity analyses to identify parameters with the largest impact on power and will recommend starting parameters. Development and testing will be grounded in the naltrexone and cognitive behavioral therapy literatures. Their widespread use and diversity of methodological approaches make them ideal testbeds from which to generalize to other treatment domains. This research is synergistic with each of the goals within the NIAAA Strategic Plan (2017-2021). Perhaps most significantly, methodology and guidelines will be developed for designing RCTs that have sufficient precision to distinguish trajectories, mechanisms, heterogeneity, and specificity of treatment efficacy. These efforts will provide researchers with the required a priori information to execute studies that ensure the robustness of their results. The development of these tools for RCT design will have implications for all areas of alcohol treatment research, including in-the-moment risk behaviors, person- level (comorbid) characteristics, targeting underserved and vulnerable populations, and large-scale initiatives. As a result, this proposal will allow for more definitive identification of efficacious interventions and treatments of alcohol use disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE NIH-funded research is critical to addressing the nearly 44% lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder and reducing the $224 billion in annual preventable costs associated with drinking; thus, it is imperative that conclusions drawn from alcohol treatment research be robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps in maximizing valid statistical inferences; yet, it has been historically overlooked in the health sciences and few tools exist for ensuring its accurate estimation. This proposal will develop a generalized framework for determining starting parameters and a flexible and user-friendly software platform for conducting power analyses of a wide range of study designs utilized by alcohol treatment researchers, thereby improving the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of health science research and enhancing the scientific integrity of clinical and public health initiatives based on such findings.",Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials,10240574,R01AA027264,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Non-linear Models', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Social Network', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uncertainty', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Walking', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'effective therapy', 'efficacious intervention', 'efficacious treatment', 'flexibility', 'health science research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'model design', 'novel', 'online registry', 'open data', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'randomized controlled design', 'simulation', 'simulation game', 'syntax', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment effect', 'treatment research', 'treatment trial', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web app']",NIAAA,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,671748
"Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development Abstract Alcohol initiation at an early age is associated with numerous negative outcomes, including a significant increase in the risk of developing an alcohol-use disorder later in life. Vulnerability for early misuse and other problematic alcohol use behaviors have been linked to individual differences in brain function. However, few studies have sought to identify brain-based predictors (‘neuromarkers’) of alcohol use behaviors in youth. Identification of brain-based predictors of alcohol use behaviors in youth is essential for the development of more effective early prevention and intervention efforts. This proposal combines machine learning and longitudinal modeling approaches to 1) identify neural networks predictive of early alcohol initiation and misuse and 2) chart the developmental trajectories of these networks over time in a large sample of youth (N>3,000) using data from three unique, proprietary and completed datasets. Neural networks conferring vulnerability for alcohol use behaviors during adolescence will be identified using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). CPM is a machine-learning method of generating behavioral predictions from individual patterns of brain organization; i.e., functional connectivity matrices. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, CPM is entirely data-driven and requires no a priori selection of brain regions or networks. As such, CPM is both a predictive tool and a method of identifying networks that underlie specific behaviors; i.e., neuromarkers. CPM has been successfully used to predict complex behaviors including future abstinence and other addiction-relevant phenotypes. This proposal will use CPM to identify neuromarkers of alcohol initiation and predict transitions to risky drinking in youth (AIM 1). Quantification of changes in brain function, e.g., growth curve trajectory analysis, is central to the characterization of developmental phenomena. Analyses of developmental trajectories can be used to identify particularly sensitive growth periods, detect variations that may signal risk, define modifiable targets, and monitor the impact of environment and interventions on development. While extant data indicate alcohol-related alterations in neural development, very few studies have assessed interactions between neurodevelopmental trajectories over time and alcohol-use behaviors. Developmental trajectories of identified networks in relation to alcohol use behaviors over time will be assessed using multilevel modeling (AIM 2). This proposal represents the first attempt to identify neural networks predictive of alcohol-initiation and risky drinking using a wholly data- driven, machine learning approach in a large sample of youth and does so using existing data. This is a critical step toward identifying a reliable predictor of alcohol initiation in youth and will shed light on individual difference factors representing vulnerability for misuse. Such predictors are needed to understand the developmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes and to inform early risk models and preventative intervention efforts. Project Narrative: Alcohol is the most commonly used substance in youth, and earlier ages of alcohol initiation are associated with increased likelihoods of alcohol-use disorder later in life. This project will identify brain networks that predict alcohol initiation and misuse—and chart the developmental trajectories of those networks over time— using existing neuroimaging data from three unique longitudinal datasets (N>3,000). Identification of brain- based predictors of alcohol initiation and misuse will aid in the development of targeted prevention and intervention efforts to address alcohol problems in youth.",Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development,10124252,R01AA027553,"['Abstinence', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'European', 'Female', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'brain research', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'hazardous drinking', 'high risk', 'high risk drinking', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'preventive intervention', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'substance use', 'theories', 'time use', 'university student', 'young adult']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,426735
"Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goals of this mentored, patient-oriented, research career development award are two-fold: 1) Characterize the autonomic nervous system correlates of stress-reactivity, both in laboratory and ambulatory contexts in order to inform the development of a biosensor driven, stress-detection classifier algorithm that can run on commercially available smartwatches, and 2) establish the principal investigator as an independent researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School. The specific aims of this research will be accomplished through an innovative study leveraging the strengths of traditional laboratory-based, psychophysiological research, and cutting-edge, in natura monitoring of stress and stress’ autonomic correlates using a combination of ecological momentary assessment of affect, and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring. This research will inform the development of a stress-detection algorithm that will run on commercially available smartwatches. The clinical and health applications for real-time stress detection are numerous, but this technology holds particular promise for individuals in early recovery from alcohol use disorder for whom unchecked stress heightens risk for alcohol use and engagement in other maladaptive coping behaviors. The smartwatch-embedded stress detection algorithm developed in this research will ultimately be linked to existing smartphone-based relapse prevention apps that will prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use risk. Aims of the principal investigator’s career development and training plan include, 1) learning fundamental principles of machine learning with an emphasis on biosensor technologies, 2) gaining facility with Matlab programming, with an emphasis on signal analysis and psychophysiological model building, 3) broadening expertise in cardiovascular waveform and interval analysis with particular emphasis on artefact management, and 4) acquiring skills in the development and application of mHealth-based clinical interventions. These goals will be achieved through a training plan comprised of mentorship, formal coursework, seminars, conferences, and manuscript preparation. Knowledge gained via the training plan will be augmented by the research undertaken. Drs. John Kelly, Paolo Bonato, Gari Clifford, and Bettina Hoeppner will serve as mentors on this award, and will provide targeted expertise in machine learning approaches, Matlab programing, artefact management, and mHealth treatment development. Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School provides an exceptional environment in which to conduct this training and research. By the end of the 5-year award period, the goals are to have a working stress-detection classifier algorithm ready for R01 testing, and for the principal investigator to be established as an independent investigator. This award is consistent with NIH's goal of increasing and maintaining a strong cohort of investigators to address the nation's clinical research needs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder carries tremendous personal and societal costs, and in spite of best clinical efforts, this disorder is characterized by very high relapse rates following treatment. There is a pressing need for novel interventions that prevent alcohol use relapse, and help individuals achieve sustained remission. This study will develop the algorithms that will enable the biosensors embedded in commercially available smartwatches to detect stress in real time using physiological measures of autonomic arousal, which will ultimately be used to trigger smartphone relapse prevention apps to prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use relapse risk.","Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches",10183106,K23AA027577,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biosensor', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Coping Behavior', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Notification', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'acute stress', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'classification algorithm', 'classifier algorithm', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'detection sensitivity', 'deter alcohol use', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'early alcohol use', 'experience', 'fitness', 'health application', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'model building', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'reduced alcohol use', 'relapse risk', 'skills', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'societal costs', 'stress management', 'stress reactivity', 'stress state', 'stressor', 'symposium', 'therapy development', 'time use', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIAAA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,183708
"Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Project summary Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, occur in up to 5% of the population in the United States, and are associated with lifelong disability. There are multiple difficulties in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of FASD, including subtlety of physical features and heterogeneity in presentation. Consequently, FASD is grossly under-recognized, and the majority of affected children never receive a diagnosis. If FASD could be diagnosed earlier and with more reliability, many years of beneficial intervention would not be lost. The objective of this research is to apply machine learning to high-dimensional data in well-characterized data sets to predict or characterize children with FASD. The central hypothesis of this research is that the application of machine learning will accurately predict and recognize FASD compared with expert clinical diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, machine learning will be employed to: 1) characterize FASD based on the presence of non-cardinal malformations, 2) establish multivariate predictors of FASD in preschool aged children, and 3) identify diagnosis specific neurodevelopmental markers that distinguish alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficits from neurodevelopmental deficits without prenatal exposure. Two secondary data sources will be used in this proposal; a prospective study of 400 pregnant women and their offspring in Ukraine (half of whom consumed high amounts of alcohol) with full clinical evaluations for FASD, and a cross- sectional study of over 2,900 first grade children in four regions of the U.S., all with clinical FASD evaluations. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, the expected contribution is for more accurate prediction and recognition of children with FASD. The proposed research is innovative, as it represents a departure from current practice by incorporating machine learning techniques into predictive models of FASD. As a perinatal epidemiologist, I have a strong foundation in analytic techniques, and the advanced training in machine learning will further enhance these skills. Additionally, the disease-focused training in dysmorphology and neurodevelopment will provide a strong foundation to make significant contributions to the field of FASD research. Finally, training and mentoring in grant writing and the responsible conduct of research will provide a strong foundation to transition to an independent researcher. This proposed research builds on previous NIAAA funded research by my interdisciplinary mentoring team, who are all strongly supportive of this research and training plan. This seminal application of machine learning to FASD research will demonstrate its capacity to predict and identify affected children, ultimately leading to earlier intervention of children prenatally exposed to alcohol. Narrative Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common and result in lifelong disabilities; however, they are clini- cally difficult to identify, and the vast majority of children with FASD are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The proposed research will leverage recent advances in machine learning to better identify children with FASD. These advances would lead to earlier identification and intervention in the lives of children prenatally exposed to alcohol, which can improve their developmental outcomes.",Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure,10245104,K01AA027811,"['Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'United States', 'Writing', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aged', 'alcohol consumption during pregnancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'disability', 'fetal diagnosis', 'first grade', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malformation', 'maternal alcohol use', 'multidimensional data', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'offspring', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research clinical testing', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'success']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2021,177129
"Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment. Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with prevalence estimates of 3-10/1000 individuals in the US and up to 80/1000 in endemic communities. The promise of an increasing number of interventions tailored to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related neurobehavioral deficits is limited by diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Currently known biomarkers of exposure are neither sensitive nor specific for neurobehavioral deficits, in part because not all exposed children are affected. There is, therefore, a critical need for biomarkers of effect to identify affected children who would benefit from early, tailored therapeutic interventions. A growing body of literature has demonstrated alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as an important potential mechanism in FASD, suggesting that such alterations may serve as biomarkers of effect. Imprinted genes comprise a unique subset of epigenetically regulated genes that is sensitive to prenatal insults. There is considerable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected by FASD and those seen in experimental animal models of imprinted gene dysregulation, including learning, memory, and attachment. In a prenatally- recruited, prospective longitudinal cohort, we recently found that PAE was associated with alterations in placental level of expression of 11 of 93 expressed imprinted genes. Expression changes for five of these genes statistically mediated effects of alcohol on postnatal growth, identifying these alterations as biomarkers of fetal alcohol growth restriction. Given the remarkable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected in FASD and those affected by alteration of imprinted gene expression in animal models, alcohol-induced alterations in placental imprinted gene expression may also provide biomarkers for FASD neurocognitive deficits. Although most epigenetic marks are specific to tissue-type and timing of exposure, genomic imprinting maps and our pilot data indicate that markers of imprinted gene dysregulation identified in placental tissue may be detected in blood samples obtained at older ages. The aims of this study are: (1) To characterize the fetal alcohol-related imprintome signature in the placenta and in blood samples obtained at 6 yr; (2) To identify alterations in imprinted gene level of expression and ICR methylation that can serve as biomarkers of effect; (3) To validate findings in Aims 1 and 2 in blood samples from a 2nd, independent cohort. The data for this study will come from two prospective longitudinal cohorts recruited from the Cape Coloured community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the prevalence of FASD is among the highest in the world. Results from this study will make it possible to identify affected children who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions but would likely not be detected by current diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite widespread public health advisories, alcohol use during pregnancy persists in the U.S. and worldwide, making fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental delay. The promise of an ever-increasing number of interventions tailored to FASD deficits is limited by difficulties in identifying fetal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology in infancy and early childhood, when interventions are most effective, and in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in which neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in the absence of dysmorphic features. This proposal seeks to identify alterations in imprinted gene expression that can be used as biomarkers of adverse effect to identify infants and children with FASD who would benefit from therapeutic interventions but would probably not be detected by current diagnostic tools.",Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment.,10212186,R01AA027916,"['Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Growth Disorders', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methylation', 'Microcephaly', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Nursery Schools', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gene function', 'imprint', 'infancy', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,584057
"Large-scale Data Scientific Assessment of Unhealthy Alcohol Consumption Among Front-Line Restaurant Workers Summary:  Unhealthy alcohol consumption is embedded within people’s everyday lives, but it is difficult to study individuals outside of laboratories and treatment offices. Many individuals engaging in excessive alcohol consumption do not make it to treatment until it has had large, sometimes catastrophic, negative effects on their life. Mobile phone apps and social media, with care taken for consent and privacy, offer an avenue for large-scale behavior-based study within an ecological context. This proposal seeks to develop techniques for the study of and prediction of unhealthy alcohol consumption within the real-world context of the restaurant industry, a population where excessive alcohol consumption is highly prevalent. Using innovative and rigorous data science techniques, we will study the cross-sectional, prospective longitudinal, and community-based relationships between unhealthy drinking and (a) affective states, (b) stress, and (c) two types of empathy: depleting and beneficial. In the process we will: (1) build a large and secure registry of digital mobile data (N = 5,925) about drinking behavior, (2) evaluate existing data-driven assessments of psychological states, (3) use machine learning to improve assessments of psychological states and predict future drinking behavior, and (4) perform one of the largest scale studies, to date, of the relationship between psychological state and unhealthy drinking. Our specific aims include: (1) Automatically assess the association of unhealthy alcohol consumption with affect, stress, and empathy among restaurant industry workers based on their linguistic behavior in social media and text messaging; (2) Develop a mobile app for longitudinal collection of fine-grained daily psychological health to analyze relation to and build prospective predictive models of daily drinking patterns; (3) Examine community affect, stress, empathy, and open-vocabulary factors, as represented by millions of local posts on public social media and assess their relationship to individual drinking behavior for restaurant industry workers. Each aim includes both the development of computational research tools and the testing of specific hypotheses. Constructs range from those with an extensive literature with respect to unhealthy drinking (emotional states), to those with burgeoning and conflicting research (stress), to those that are highly novel (empathy). We have extensive experience in collecting data and developing apps, including preliminary work at recruiting bartenders and servers. Related research and our preliminary work already suggests that there are strong links between unhealthy drinking and digital language data. We will release our software tools -- the app platform and predictive models -- under open source licenses accompanied with instructional tutorials. We see this work as trail-blazing a broad use-case for data scientific language-based assessments to study unhealthy drinking. Narrative  Unhealthy alcohol consumption is ecological, embedded within people’s everyday lives, but it is difficult to study individuals outside of laboratories and treatment offices. Focused on bartenders and servers, an at risk population, we will use innovative and rigorous data science techniques over mobile and social media data to study the cross-sectional, prospective longitudinal, and community-based relationships between unhealthy drinking and (a) affective states, (b) stress, and (c) empathy.

"Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder 1 Project Summary/Abstract  2 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition and a major public health problem with few  3 pharmaceutical treatments available. Systems-based computational strategies that integrate brain gene  4 expression signatures of rodent models of AUD risk with gene expression signatures of pharmaceuticals show  5 promise for identifying compounds that decrease excessive drinking in rodents. However, this methodology  6 has limited clinical potential because it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from patients. Identifying a  7 clinically accessible tissue would facilitate the application of advanced computational approaches to identify  8 better therapeutics for AUD and personalize AUD treatment. To this end, the proposed research aims to  9 determine whether blood can be used as a surrogate tissue for brain by using a within-subjects design to 10 compare transcript levels in both tissues in mice during protracted withdrawal, a sensitive time for relapse to 11 excessive alcohol drinking. The research will also determine whether whole blood transcriptome profiles can be 12 used to classify subjects according to alcohol dependence status and to computationally predict compounds 13 that reduce alcohol consumption and anxiety- and depression-like behavior. The clinical and mechanistic 14 insights that will emerge from the proposed research should be considered independently. The first could lead 15 to effective diagnostic tools or candidate treatments, whereas the second will provide insight into the 16 pathophysiology of AUD. It might be the case that the blood transcriptome at least partially reflects the changes 17 in brain, and that targeting these changes is therapeutic. Or it might be the case that targeting the blood 18 transcriptome is therapeutic, irrespective of brain changes. The proposed study will provide crucial new 19 knowledge about a relatively new and unexplored area of addiction research that could drive molecular-based 20 diagnostic or therapeutic tools and personalized medicine approaches for AUD or other diseases where brain is 21 the primary affected tissue. Project Narrative Recent evidence in mice suggests that brain gene expression profiles can predict drugs effective for treating alcoholism, but it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from human patients which limits the usefulness of this approach. This research will investigate the extent to which blood can act as a surrogate for brain tissue and predict alcohol dependence status and drug treatments. This information will help to develop molecular- based diagnosis and treatment options for alcoholics and gain insights into the biological mechanisms that might contribute to the transition from recreational alcohol use to excessive drinking.",Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder,10092805,F32AA028148,"['Acids', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol withdrawal syndrome', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Ethanol', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Marble', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pergolide', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Schizophrenia', 'Specimen', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Tail Suspension', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Whole Blood', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol availability', 'alcohol use disorder', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain tissue', 'clinical development', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'drug candidate', 'forced swim test', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'negative affect', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'problem drinker', 'random forest', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vapor']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2021,19560
"Trans-omic Analysis of Alcohol Consumption and its Relation to Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alcohol consumption is an important modifiable lifestyle risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Advances in high-throughput technologies have made it possible to measure and analyze a variety of ‘omics’, that is, DNA methylation (methylome), gene expression (transcriptome), protein (proteome) and metabolite (metabolome), in relation to alcohol consumption and CVD in a cost-efficient manner. In this grant proposal, we will test the hypothesis that alcohol consumption alters multiple molecular processes across different “omics” dimensions and these molecular intermediates mediate alcohol’s effects on CVD. To test this hypothesis, we will assemble a multidisciplinary team to test five Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will first identify alcohol-associated transcriptomic markers. We will then examine the associations of alcohol-associated transcriptomic markers with incident CVD (fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke), and test whether these transcriptomic markers mediate the effect of alcohol intake on incident CVD. We will construct polygenic risk scores to examine the potential causal relationships between alcohol intake, transcriptomic markers, and incident CVD. We will also conduct a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to further test and quantify the causal relationships. In Aims 2 and 3, we will identify alcohol-associated proteomic (Aim 2) and metabolomic (Aim 3) markers and will test the relationship between alcohol, omics markers and CVD using similar methods outlined in Aim 1. Many alcohol-associated DNA methylation markers have been identified by our prior study in >13,000 participants. Therefore, in Aim 4, we will examine the relations of alcohol-associated DNA methylation markers with incident CVD using similar methods outlined in Aim 1. In Aim 5, we will integrate alcohol-associated multi-omics markers to identify key pathways and multi-omics modules associated with alcohol intake and CVD. We will perform Random Forest analysis to identify additional alcohol-associated multi- omics markers. We will also perform network analyses to identify modules of alcohol-associated multi-omics markers. We will examine the relationships between these identified multi-omics markers with incident CVD, and will functionally annotate these markers using bioinformatics tools (e.g., ENCODE, GTEx, Human Metabolome Database, and UniProt). With the completion of this project, we will highlight the novel molecular targets for both alcohol-associated CVD risk prevention and treatment. In addition, we will generate a multi-omics biomarker database of alcohol intake with tailored software to facilitate the future investigations of alcohol’s relations with other non-communicable diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases.

"Leveraging electronic health records to identify risky alcohol use prior to surgery Project Summary/Abstract Patients who consume more than two drinks a day prior to elective surgery are at increased risk of experiencing a myriad of surgical complications, readmissions, and prolonged hospital stays. Fortunately, short-term pre-operative abstinence from alcohol mitigates many surgical risks, and carefully timed interventions can prevent complications and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, implementation of pre- operative alcohol interventions requires accurate identification of patients with risky alcohol use at least four weeks prior to surgery. Pre-operative clinics frequently fail to screen for alcohol use or do so too close to the surgery date to allow time for intervention. Electronic health records (EHRs) offer an unprecedented amount of accessible clinical data that can be leveraged to identify risky alcohol use early in the surgical episode of care. Innovative methods are needed to identify data elements and create algorithms to capture risky alcohol use from structured and unstructured EHR data. Natural language processing (NLP) and other machine learning (ML)-based approaches are best suited to extract and analyze alcohol-related clinical narratives, and to synthesize heterogeneous alcohol-related data through computer-assisted methods. The proposed study will leverage EHR data to identify and characterize risky alcohol use among surgical patients to identify cohorts who could benefit from pre-operative alcohol intervention. The study aims are to: 1) develop an electronic, automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using NLP and ML; 2) validate the algorithm through prospective data collection; and 3) longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use phenotypes and adverse surgical outcomes including complications and hospital readmissions. Innovative applications of NLP and ML will support evaluation of unstructured EHR data (e.g. clinical notes) and will enable integration of heterogeneous alcohol use data to create the computable phenotype. The aims will be achieved through collaboration of experts in key clinical domains and advanced methodologies. This study will create and validate the first alcohol-specific phenotype-based algorithm for surgical patients, which will support future clinical applications and research into alcohol-related surgical interventions and health outcomes. Study outcomes are expected to have immediate value for identifying cohorts for future implementation research and lead to a new clinical tool for surgical clinics. Project Narrative Risky alcohol use is one of the most common risk factors for surgical complications among elective surgical patients. This study will develop an automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using electronic health record data, and longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use and adverse surgical outcomes.

"Towards a Wearable Alcohol Biosensor: Examining the Accuracy of BAC Estimates from New-Generation Transdermal Technology using Large-Scale Human Testing and Machine Learning Algorithms A wearable alcohol biosensor could represent a tremendous advance towards helping people make informed decisions about their drinking and, ultimately, towards curbing alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. Transdermal sensors, which measure alcohol consumption by assessing the alcohol content of insensible perspiration, offer a uniquely non-invasive, passive, and low-cost method for the continuous assessment of drinking likely to be attractive to a range of populations. But the relationship between transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) and blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is highly complex, varying across individuals and contexts and involving some degree of lag time. Prior research, which has featured extremely small participant samples and examined old-generation transdermal devices, has been poorly suited to modeling this complexity. Thus, scientists are left with little sense for how to translate data produced by transdermal sensors into estimates of BAC. Importantly, the past decade has seen remarkable technological and analytic developments, offering the potential to tackle the challenge of TAC-BAC translation. In particular, in recent years, machine learning approaches have been developed that are particularly well suited to modeling highly complex and time-lagged relationships within larger datasets. Also during this time period, a new generation of transdermal device has come under development, featuring sleek/compact designs, smartphone integration, and capabilities for sampling TAC at approximately 90 times the rate of older-generation devices. These sensors thus provide a rich source of data for machine learning models and also, for the first time, the potential to produce transdermal BAC estimates in real time. The proposed research leverages machine learning, novel transdermal technology, and large-scale multimodal human testing to translate transdermal sensor data into estimates of BAC. Transdermal sensors will be examined in the context of multimodal research featuring a large and diverse participant sample (N=240) examined both inside and outside the laboratory. The ambulatory arm of the proposed project is aimed at capturing the TAC-BAC relationship across individuals in varying real-world drinking contexts, examining regular drinkers wearing new-generation transdermal sensors in everyday settings while providing prompted breathalyzer readings. This ambulatory research will be complemented by a laboratory study arm, aimed at examining the TAC-BAC relationship among individuals drinking in a controlled setting while alcohol dose and rate of consumption are systematically manipulated. Machine learning algorithms, including deep neural network models, will be used to create estimates of BAC from transdermal sensor data. These estimates will be examined in terms of their accuracy, temporal specificity, and also context-dependence. Thus, results will carry significance for addiction science by translating transdermal sensor data and clarifying the place of these sensors in our arsenal of techniques for assessing, preventing, and treating problem drinking. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wearable alcohol biosensor might serve health needs across a variety of domains, including aiding in the prevention of alcohol-related disorders, improving interventions for treating problem drinking, and refining outcome assessment in alcohol research. Transdermal sensors represent a uniquely noninvasive and low-cost method for the continuous assessment of alcohol consumption, but data produced by these sensors is highly complex. The current project leverages advances in transdermal technology and computational modeling to translate transdermal data and assess the accuracy of transdermal BAC estimates, thus taking a key step towards clarifying the place of transdermal sensors in our arsenal of techniques for assessing, preventing, and treating problem drinking.",Towards a Wearable Alcohol Biosensor: Examining the Accuracy of BAC Estimates from New-Generation Transdermal Technology using Large-Scale Human Testing and Machine Learning Algorithms,10298493,R01AA028488,"['Abstinence', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Disorders', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Biosensor', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose-Rate', 'Enrollment', 'Family', 'Generations', 'Grain', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Race', 'Reading', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol abstinence', 'alcohol content', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol monitoring', 'alcohol prevention', 'alcohol research', 'analytical method', 'arm', 'contingency management', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drinking', 'fitbit', 'human subject', 'improved', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'sex', 'wearable device']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,460118
"Alcohol-induced cardiac injury and repair in human induced pluripotent stem cell model PROJECT SUMMARY Alcohol exposure is a key risk factor for abnormal heart development and contributes to congenital heart disease, the leading non-infectious cause of infant mortality. Alcohol-induced impaired heart growth and development in early life can also increase the risk of heart disease later in adulthood. Furthermore, adult cardiac system is also sensitive to alcohol exposure, which is an important but underappreciated risk factor contributing to heart disease. Alcohol exposure is associated with ischemic events, arrhythmias and alterations in cardiac function and structure. These pathological consequences could result from complex actions of alcohol including increased cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and abnormal Ca2+ handling. Inflammatory cytokines produced by alcohol exposure could also contribute to alcohol-induced heart injury. However, mechanisms underlying alcohol- induced heart disease are not fully defined and effective therapies are lacking. Traditionally, studies on alcohol exposure have relied on animal models and cells because of limited availability and growth capacity of human primary cardiomyocytes. However, studies in animal models are time consuming, expensive, and not amenable for high-throughput drug screening, and have limitations due to physiological differences from humans. To complement the studies on animal models and cells, we have recently explored the use of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) as a novel and physiologically relevant model to study alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity. hiPSC-CMs have many features similar to human primary CMs, can be engineered into tissue-like structures and maintained in long-term cultures, and can be adapted for high-throughput platforms. We have demonstrated that exposure of hiPSC-CMs with clinically relevant doses of alcohol can recapitulate pathological events caused by alcohol exposure, including oxidative stress, altered gene expression and cardiac dysfunction as indicated by abnormal Ca2+ handling and contractility. We have adapted hiPSC-CMs into high- throughput formats and established high-throughput assays to detect alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity and screen for cardiac proliferative/protective agents. Using this in vitro human cell model and state-of-the-art high- throughput technologies, we propose to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced toxicity in human cardiomyocytes and evaluate potential therapies to mitigate alcohol-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, we plan to investigate the involvement of inflammatory cytokines in alcohol-induced cardiac injury and repair. We expect that our established hiPSC-CM model will help understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying alcohol toxicity in human cardiomyocytes and accelerate the development of targeted and effective therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prenatal alcohol exposure is a key factor contributing to abnormal heart development and is associated with various cardiac anomalies with serious long-term complications in adulthood. This study aims to discover novel molecular mechanisms and potential therapies to control the detrimental effect of alcohol exposure on cellular and functional properties of heart cells using human stem cell model.",Alcohol-induced cardiac injury and repair in human induced pluripotent stem cell model,10209255,R01AA028527,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Apoptosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'CXCL12 gene', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Death', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Ethanol', 'Ethanol toxicity', 'Event', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Injuries', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Infant Mortality', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural regeneration', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Response Elements', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'RyR2', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cell-Derived Factor 1', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Woman', 'alcohol consumption during pregnancy', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'appropriate dose', 'cardiogenesis', 'clinically relevant', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cytokine', 'cytotoxicity', 'effective therapy', 'heart cell', 'heart disease risk', 'heart function', 'high throughput screening', 'high throughput technology', 'high-throughput drug screening', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'human stem cells', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'injury and repair', 'interest', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'nuclear factor-erythroid 2', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'stem cell model', 'stem cells', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAAA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,351750
"Optimizing Brief Alcohol Interventions for Young Adults via Computational Methods Project Summary The goal of this Independent Scientist Award (K02) is to seek “protected time” for a period of intensive research focus to enhance the Candidate’s career development and to conduct research on the comparative effectiveness of competing brief alcohol interventions and their mechanisms. The proposed research strategy represents an ongoing, NIAAA-supported independent research program (R01 AA019511: Estimating Comparative Effectiveness of Alcohol Interventions for Young Adults, received 3rd percentile score). This K02 extends the R01 by (1) including an additional 25 data sets of individual participant data from brief alcohol interventions conducted between 2013 and 2020, and (2) embracing machine learning algorithms and other state-of-the-art statistical methods to help identify mechanisms of behavior change and to integrate and synthesize them across heterogeneous studies. The proposed protected time will be critical to update and enrich my research program in this current, rapidly changing clinical research environment. With accumulating high-quality clinical data and real-world data in the context of emerging data science capabilities, there exist opportunities as well as challenges. I am well suited to tackle emerging challenges for unprecedented opportunities, given my work in statistical data integration and broad experience in alcohol research. I want to create a large database where one can simultaneously examine secular/cohort effects, intervention effects, and effect heterogeneity at the most granular data level by developing and using new tools. My career goal is to become “one of the major hubs,” connecting disparate networks of researchers into a large connected network, promoting fluid interactions. The synergy from the large, interdisciplinary network would be helpful toward creating a “value” proposition of Big Data – the sum of the knowledge and insights from the collaboration by investigators is greater than isolated pursuits by each. Toward this goal, career development activities will be to (1) train in computational machine learning algorithms and real-world large-dimensional data analysis to facilitate collaboration with addiction researchers and statisticians; (2) enhance my understanding of technology-assisted adaptive interventions and passively collected outcomes data; (3) update my knowledge in basic health sciences related to addiction; and (4) submit at least two publications and two grants per year using newly acquired knowledge and skills proposed under K02. I have identified six highly active, nationally acclaimed experts in their respective fields. I will have individual and group research meetings with all six collaborators (three new collaborators for this K02) to develop innovative projects. In addition, I will attend workshops and conferences for training, carry out online training, and have guided reading and discussion with collaborators. I will visit collaborators for in-depth discussions and problem-solving. Improving big data capabilities for biomedical and clinical research has been one of the major strategic plans of the NIH, and I am motivated and prepared to help meet that critical mission. Project Narrative Through innovative, comparative effectiveness research, we can improve interventions and develop individualized intervention strategies, which will reduce the serious negative consequences associated with heavy drinking and enhance the lives of adolescents and young adults. The results of this study will have a significant impact for all major stakeholders, including adolescents and young adults in need of treatment and their families, trial developers/researchers, school administrators. More broadly, this research will strengthen research practice, enhance transparency, and maximize the benefits of data sharing.",Optimizing Brief Alcohol Interventions for Young Adults via Computational Methods,10223741,K02AA028630,"['Administrator', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collaborations', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Medical Research', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sex Differences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Sum', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol research', 'behavior change', 'brief alcohol intervention', 'brief motivational intervention', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'multiple data sources', 'personalized intervention', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'racial difference', 'research and development', 'sex', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'tool', 'underage drinking', 'underage drinking prevention', 'university student', 'uptake', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,K02,2021,134843
"Brain Function and Neurogenomic influences on AUD risk and resilience. This COGA (Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism) spinoff application aims to understand structural/functional features in key brain networks (Default Mode Network (DMN), Executive Control Network (ECN), Reward/Salience Network (RSN)) underlying the critical transition from regular drinking to DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in young adult offspring from enriched COGA families, by combining newly ascertained structural, diffusion and functional (s/d/fMRI), Neuropsychological (NPsych) and Electrophysiological (EPhys) data together with existing multimodal longitudinal data (85% with 3+ assessments). The well- characterized, genetically informative COGA sample with many offspring from families densely affected with AUD at higher risk to develop AUD will be moving through the understudied age of young adulthood/early midlife (20's, 30's), when most longitudinal AUD development studies end and when our data predicts that a substantial portion from high density families will transition from regular alcohol use to AUD. This proposal will target 150 young adults (mean age 26) from the COGA study who are current regular drinkers (1/month+ for >6 months, but do not currently meet criteria for DSM-5 AUD), and will follow them longitudinally with a multimodal approach to compare those who transition to DSM-5 AUD and those who do not. We will add s/d/fMRI measures that are not part of the COGA protocol, to provide anatomical specificity to complement current and existing NPsych and EPhys longitudinal data during resting state, and three analogous cognitive/affective tasks [response inhibition (Go/NoGo), reward processing (monetary gambling task), and affect modulation (cognitive/affective Stroop)]. Combining machine learning methods, advanced nonparametric, linear mixed methods, survival model, and joint models of longitudinal data and survival data, we will: (Aim 1) identify features in specific neural circuits (DMN, ECN, RSN) during resting state and during cognitive/affective tasks in young adults who transition from regular drinking to AUD diagnosis from those who do not; (Aim 2) study the effects of drinking behaviors (e.g. age, pattern, duration of alcohol use) on the s/d/fMRI, EPhys, and NPsych features in specific neural circuits associated with the transition to AUD identified in Aim 1; and (Aim 3) determine the role of polygenic risk as measured by polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from alcohol use- and brain-related GWAS, other risk/protective factors [i.e., sex, race/ethnicity, family history, comorbid substance use (nicotine, cannabis), and psychiatric disorders (depression), COVID-related traumatic stress] on neural circuits and their developmental trajectories associated with transitions to AUD identified in Aims 1 and 2. The strength of our diverse, genetically informative, enriched high-risk sample of young adults, longitudinal multimodal measures, and novel integrative analyses will elucidate vulnerabilities and reciprocal relationships among neural circuits, genomic and other risk/protectives factors in the transition to AUD during the 20s and 30s, with utility in prevention and treatment initiatives. This project will address important challenges of understanding deficits in structural and functional brain networks underlying the transition from regular drinking to Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) by investigating multidomain measures of brain function—structural/density-weighted/functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (s/d/fMRI) longitudinal electrophysiological (EEG, Event Related Potential/Oscillation (ERP/ERO)) and neurocognitive data in a genetically informative enriched high risk diverse adolescent and young adult prospective study sample, now entering the understudied age of emerging adulthood to midlife. With the use of novel analytic methods to leverage this unique high risk longitudinal multimodal dataset, with data from before and after the initiation of drinking behaviors, this study will elucidate reciprocal relationships among genomic and other risk/protective factors (e.g., COVID-19 related traumatic stress), sex differences and the role of vulnerabilities in neural circuits in the transitions to AUD with utility in prevention and treatment initiatives.",Brain Function and Neurogenomic influences on AUD risk and resilience.,10298736,R01AA028848,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cannabis', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Fiber', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gambling', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nicotine', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Pattern', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Environment', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Work', 'age effect', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'alcohol use initiation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'binge drinking', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'density', 'developmental disease', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emerging adult', 'emerging adulthood', 'executive function', 'genetics of alcoholism', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'high risk drinking', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroadaptation', 'neurogenomics', 'novel', 'offspring', 'polygenic risk score', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'reward processing', 'sex', 'substance use', 'temporal measurement', 'trait', 'traumatic stress', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIAAA,SUNY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,525101
"Mapping the co-evolution of Craving, Affect, Stressors, and Access to Alcohol (CASA) using responsive EMA ABSTRACT Recovering from Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) following treatment is difficult, with 43-83% relapsing post- discharge. These chronically high rates arise, in part, because of a gap in our knowledge about the co-evolution of in the moment risk mechanisms associated with relapse among those recovering from AUD, including Craving, Negative Affect, Stressors and Access to alcohol (CASA). These four factors co-evolve among important protective factors that buffer relapse risk (e.g., improved sober support and psychosocial function associated with post-treatment community AUD recovery programs), and context-based risk factors such as near-at-hand places where alcohol is available. The immediate goal of this project is to develop the means to assess and understand the impact of these environmental/contextual factors for recovering alcoholics, towards a longer term research objective of developing effective just-in-time interventions that mitigate the risk of relapse. In this project, we will leverage novel assessment methodologies via a responsive ecological momentary assessment (rEMA) system developed by our team. This app-based system allows researchers to incorporate geospatial, time- specific and event-specific criteria for enhanced monitoring of (and just-in-time delivery of interventions to) recovering patients in post-treatment settings. Consistent with PA-18-620 from NIAAA, this project aims to build foundational evidence and refine the data collection/analysis strategy needed to achieve our long term objective, via the following specific aims: Aim 1) Pilot the use of our rEMA platform to capture fine-grained longitudinal data on Craving, Affect, Stressors and Access to alcohol among 60 recovering alcoholics across 30 days, to evaluate CASA construct validity within rEMA data and assess the extent and impact of data missingness; Aim 2) Test incentive modalities that will inform us regarding best practices that maximize adherence to the rEMA protocol; Aim 3) Develop analytic strategies based machine-learning models of rEMA data, to forecast imminent risk and quantify causal pathways among CASA variables. To accomplish these aims, we will recruit and enroll adults (n=60; 50% female) in non-hospitalized residential AUD treatments in the Central Plains. Using smartphone assessment with GPS monitoring technology, we will collect longitudinal behavioral and experiential data from each participant over 30 days. Analysis of these data will advance our understanding of co-evolving contextual/social-environmental factors that impact the success/failure of the recovery effort, while establishing foundational evidence from which time/event-specific smartphone-based just-in-time interventions may be developed. The final phase of the project includes the creation of an advisory and dissemination board composed of local and national-level stakeholders, AUD treatment practitioners and other researchers that will guide the development of such an intervention. Included in this group are the directors of two non-hospitalized residential substance treatment facilities that function as community partners for the project through all project stages. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a significant need for reliable fine-grained data on the physical, behavioral, and cognitive dimensions of relapse and recovery among individuals recovering from alcohol use disorders. This study will use cutting-edge responsive ecological momentary assessment software to track craving, affect, stress, alcohol access, and exposure to support/risk locations among a cohort of 60 individuals currently participating in a non-hospitalized residential housing program. This data collection and modeling effort will set the stage for a more nuanced understanding of relapse and recovery risk patterns experienced by those with an alcohol use disorder, while supporting future cost-effective programming of relapse prevention and intervention services.","Mapping the co-evolution of Craving, Affect, Stressors, and Access to Alcohol (CASA) using responsive EMA",10196353,R21AA029231,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alaska', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Buffers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Cities', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Great Plains', 'Hand', 'Homelessness', 'Housing', 'Incentives', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Puerto Rico', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residential Facilities', 'Residential Treatment', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol availability', 'alcohol outlet density', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'data access', 'data modeling', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'distilled alcoholic beverage', 'drinking', 'environmental stressor', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'negative affect', 'next generation', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'public health research', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'service intervention', 'sobriety', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'stressor', 'substance use', 'substance use treatment', 'success', 'treatment program', 'treatment services']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,R21,2021,262406
"Striatal fast-spiking interneurons regulate compulsive alcohol consumption Project Summary Alcohol use disorder has a major impact on public health, yet the brain mechanisms driving alcohol misuse are poorly understood. Habits are repetitive motor sequences that persist despite reward devaluation and form the action strategy that underlies compulsive behavior. Chronic alcohol exposure facilitates habit learning and leads to increased habitual behavior in chronic users. The dorsolateral striatum (the putamen in humans) regulates habit learning and its resident inhibitory cells, the fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs), are targeted by alcohol exposure. To determine if alcohol utilizes FSIs to promote compulsive alcohol consumption, I selectively ablated striatal FSIs in animals undergoing a voluntary intermittent drinking paradigm (Drinking in the Dark) and challenged animals with the adulterant quinine to measure compulsive consumption. FSI ablation abolished compulsive alcohol consumption and significantly disrupted organized ethanol lick sequence behavior. The next essential step toward advancing this finding to a clinical application is to determine the specific time window that FSIs are recruited for the formation or maintenance of the motor sequences that underlie compulsive drinking. To this end I propose two aims of investigation using innovative optogenetic and machine learning approaches: 1) to determine if striatal FSIs are necessary for the development of the organized actions of compulsive ethanol consumption and; 2) to determine if striatal FSIs are necessary for the maintenance of organized actions underlying compulsive ethanol consumption. The results of this study will significantly advance our understanding of motor sequence learning, the role of motor sequences in compulsive behavior, and will indicate the necessary time window for future therapeutic interventions targeting compulsive drinking. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder poses a substantial public health burden that is projected to increase in response to COVID- 19. Compulsive drinking is a core feature of the disorder that is poorly treated by current therapies. This proposal will determine how neural circuits exposed to alcohol give rise to compulsive alcohol consumption behavior and will provide critical training opportunities toward scientific independence for the principal investigator.",Striatal fast-spiking interneurons regulate compulsive alcohol consumption,10387913,F31AA029264,"['Ablation', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'COVID-19', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Compulsive Behavior', 'Consumption', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ethanol', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quinine', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Water', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol testing', 'alcohol use disorder', 'alcohol-related death', 'base', 'clinical application', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'drug of abuse', 'fluorophore', 'habit learning', 'innovation', 'men&apos', 's group', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sequence learning', 'statistics', 'training opportunity', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,F31,2021,38324
"Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV: Ending the HIV Epidemic through interventions and Epidemiology at the intersection of the alcohol and HIV care Continua Established in 2011, the Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV (ARCH) conducts high impact epidemiological and intervention studies that address relationships between at-risk alcohol use and AUD, the HIV Care Continuum (HIV-CC) and health outcomes. ARCH is embedded in and has capitalized on the research and clinical infrastructure of the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), an eight site clinical cohort of university-based HIV clinics across the US, with many of these clinics located in high priority regions for Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE). The overarching theme of the proposed P01 is to expand scientific knowledge and treatment interventions at the intersection of the Alcohol-Care Continuum (Alc-CC), HIV-CC and HIV related comorbidities across the full spectrum of alcohol use -- with particular attention to individual context and social determinants of health -- using implementation and epidemiological research. Our scientific goals are: 1) To implement evidence-based alcohol interventions (EBI) across the alcohol use spectrum among PWH using rigorous hybrid-implementation effectiveness designs; 2) To understand how multi-level contextual factors impact the alcohol use spectrum, the Alc-CC and HIV-CC, comorbidities, and intervention responses among PWH; 3) To determine optimal alcohol reduction targets (e.g. abstinence v low-risk drinking, reduction in WHO risk score) among PWH in the context of the Alc-CC, HIV-CC and HIV-related comorbidities. This ARCH P01 has three research projects. We are proposing a Hybrid Type III effectiveness-implementation trial integrating alcohol EBIs into HIV clinical care. This study is a direct extension of our earlier research findings demonstrating a robust effect of a computerized brief intervention embedded in a stepped care treatment approach for PWH with at-risk drinking. Our second project is a Hybrid Type1 effectiveness-implementation pilot trial developing and testing a novel relapse prevention intervention (RPI) for PWH. The importance of our focus on RPI is highlighted by our recent finding that any alcohol use among PWH with AUD is associated with increased viremia and the well-established high relapse prevalence of 50 – 75% of persons in remission. Our epidemiological project will provide outcomes data for the intervention trials as well as examine the full spectrum of alcohol use, the Alc-CC and their relationship to HIV-CC, comorbidities and co-infections in the context of social determinants of health. An administrative core provides the structure and processes to support collaboration and synergy across ARCH projects and investigators. A biostatistics and methods core supports analyses for the three projects and development of novel analytic methods. A transdisciplinary group of investigators brings depth and breadth of expertise to this program. Building on a decade of collaborative research progress and administrative structure in ARCH and capitalizing on the extensive resources of CNICS, this P01 proposal addresses issues of high relevance to the US goal of ending the HIV epidemic and the Office of AIDS Research priorities, including HIV Treatment as Prevention, HIV related comorbidities and disparities. At-risk alcohol use, alcohol use disorder and return to drinking can have negative impacts on people with HIV (PWH). We propose to integrate alcohol reduction and relapse prevention interventions into HIV clinical care settings and to study the long-term effects of the spectrum of alcohol use on the alcohol and HIV care continua, comorbidities and disparities among a large, multi-site cohort of PWH.",Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV: Ending the HIV Epidemic through interventions and Epidemiology at the intersection of the alcohol and HIV care Continua,10304371,P01AA029544,"['Abstinence', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Liver diseases', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Universities', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Viremia', 'alcohol abstinence', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol relapse', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol use disorder', 'analytical method', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'brief intervention', 'clinical care', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical research site', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'drinking', 'effectiveness implementation study', 'effectiveness implementation trial', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'frailty', 'high risk drinking', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'novel', 'pilot trial', 'preventive intervention', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'social health determinants', 'success', 'synergism', 'treatment as prevention', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning', 'uptake']",NIAAA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,P01,2021,1454829
"Open bar assay: A novel operant paradigm for examining motivated response and substance abuse in Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individual variation in alcohol preference and self-administration facilitates compulsive alcohol seeking behavior. However, the circuit identity and function underlying individual variability in alcohol self-administration behaviors is still not well understood. The goal of this proposal is to identify subtle behavioral features, fundamental circuitry principles and neurophysiological dynamics underlying alcohol preference in the tractable model system Drosophila melanogaster. Aim 1 will employ a computer vision and machine learning approach to identify subtle behaviors that relate to alcohol preference and alcohol avoidance. In this Aim I hypothesize that animals that express alcohol preference display enhanced seeking behavior, in particular in response to alcohol self- administration whereas lower alcohol preference will manifest through avoidance and reduced locomotion. Aim 2 will employ thermogenetic inactivation, using the GAL4/UAS system, of learning and memory brain circuits we believe play a direct role in encoding alcohol preference. In this Aim I hypothesize that inactivation of our identified learning and memory brain circuits will directly suppress the expression of alcohol preference in flies. Aim 3 will investigate how the neurophysiological dynamics of our identified circuit differs between alcohol preferers and abstainers. I hypothesize that, in my identified circuit, alcohol exposure will result in robust neurophysiological responses in alcohol-preferers and that we will observe the opposite in alcohol abstainers. This work will provide a framework for predicting general circuit principles for escalation of alcohol self- administration in more complex brains, which is in alignment with NIAAA’s mission to support behavioral research on the causes of alcoholism and alcohol-related problems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Innate drug preference has a direct impact on reward- and addiction-related behaviors, and yet how innate drug preference manifests is not well characterized. Here I will examine the behavioral, circuit and neurophysiological mechanisms underlying alcohol preference. These experiments will provide a reductionist framework for evaluating motivation to self-administer alcohol, and natural rewards, in vertebrates.",Open bar assay: A novel operant paradigm for examining motivated response and substance abuse in Drosophila melanogaster,10313324,F32AA029595,"['Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Escalator', 'Ethanol', 'Factor Analysis', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Individuality', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mushroom Bodies', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Self Administration', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol response', 'alcohol seeking behavior', 'alcohol use disorder', 'awake', 'body system', 'data pipeline', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'individual variation', 'memory encoding', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'two-photon']",NIAAA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,65994
"Cortical subcortical reorganization and risk behaviors of early alcohol use initiation Project Summary/Abstract Early initiation of alcohol use (EIAU) during adolescence is a key contributor to development of lifetime alcohol (AUD) and/or substance use disorders (SUDs). A critical component for preventing and intervening EIAU is early detection using behavioral or cognitive risk precursors; and understanding better their underlying neural substrates before the onset of substance use may aid in developing more effective and targeted interventions. Prior studies suggest sleep disturbance, internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and cognitive performance are potential risk precursors of EIAU. However, mixed or inconsistent findings have been reported which may reflect study design and methodological issues, and the neural substrates subserving co- development of these frequently occurring problems remain to be identified. In this application, we propose to use data from the longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the neural substrates that are predictive of EIAU and its risk precursors. A number of advanced analytical approaches will be used to extract novel features at both structural and functional levels. For example, the Joint and Individual Variance Explained (JIVE) method will be used to extract biologically meaningful cortical-subcortical covariation patterns. Existing literature and our preliminary results led us to hypothesize that the cortical-subcortical covariation pattern including brainstem, thalamus, prefrontal cortex and other regions underlies the co- development of sleep, internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and poor cognitive function from late childhood to mid-adolescence. Specifically, this project has three complementary aims. Aim 1 will assess the relationships between the baseline cortical-subcortical covariation patterns and EIAU and its four risk precursors in mid-adolescence. Aim 2 will characterize the developmental trajectory of cortical-subcortical covariation pattern and assess its dynamic relationship with the four risk precursors longitudinally. Aim 3 will explore whether functional connectivity predicts sleep disturbance, cognitive performance, behavioral problems, and/or age at first alcohol use. Results from this application will significantly advance the field of addiction neuroscience. Project Narrative Problematic use of alcohol, marijuana and tobacco represent enormous public health costs, and use of substances, particularly alcohol, often begins in adolescence. The big data approach proposed in this application will lead to identification of neural factors linked to risk precursors for early initiation of alcohol and other substance use, including sleep problems, internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and cognitive impairment in late childhood and early adolescence. The results generated from this project will inform the rationale for designing early detection and intervention before onset of alcohol/substance use in adolescents.",Cortical subcortical reorganization and risk behaviors of early alcohol use initiation,10317213,R01AA029611,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'adolescent alcohol and drug use', 'advanced analytics', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'boys', 'brain circuitry', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'connectome', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'early alcohol use', 'executive function', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'girls', 'gray matter', 'innovation', 'insight', 'joint loading', 'male', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'substance use', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,358778
"Microbiota-Mediated Bidirectional Interactions Between Alcohol Misuse and Post-COVID-19 Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY Recent data show that 10-30% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients do not fully recover and suffer from a wide range of symptoms that persist after the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been cleared (so-called post- COVID-19 syndrome or Long Hauler). Severe COVID-19 and associated risk factors appear to increase the risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome and yet a substantial number of patients without known risk factors also develop post-COVID-19 syndrome. Thus, additional risk factors leading to post-COVID-19 syndrome must exist. One potential risk factor is excessive alcohol consumption. (1) Alcohol is the most frequently used drug in the United States, and alcohol use increases during public health crises, especially in socioeconomic disadvantaged communities. (2) Alcohol results in inappropriate immune responses to pathogens. (3) Alcohol disrupts intestinal and lung barrier integrity which can further promote inflammation. We recently showed that increased serum Zonulin (a marker of disrupted intestinal barrier integrity) and increased endotoxin (LBP) are associated with inflammation during COVID-19 and can predict disease severity and mortality. Accordingly, we hypothesize that: (a) there is a bidirectional interaction between alcohol misuse and SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to increased risk of post-COVID-19 syndrome in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and more severe AUD in COVID-19 patients; and (b) the underlying mechanism of these interactions is microbiota dysbiosis and/or disruption of intestinal barrier integrity, promoting inflammation and dysregulated immune-responses to the virus. To test our hypotheses, we will leverage our NIAAA supported COVID-19 supplement at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), which is actively following more than 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and 2,000 SARS- CoV-2 negative patients over 12 months using structured questionnaires. All patients are screened for alcohol use/misuse. Furthermore, we will recruit a subset of patients to provide biological samples to test our mechanistic hypothesis evaluating the link between AUD, post-COVID-19 syndrome, and gut-derived inflammation. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that AUD increases the risk and severity of post-COVID-19 syndrome by promoting gut-derived inflammation. (1a) We will determine if increased alcohol use/misuse is associated with risk and severity of post-COVID-19 syndrome. (1b) We will elucidate the role of gut-derived inflammation in AUD promotion of the post-COVID-19 syndrome by interrogating stool microbiota composition/function, systemic markers of intestinal barrier integrity, inflammation, and immune activation. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that COVID-19 increases the risk and severity of AUD and alcohol-induced intestinal barrier disruption. (2a) we will determine whether post-COVID-19 syndrome is associated with increased risk of AUD. (2b) We will determine if COVID-19 decreases resilience of intestinal barrier to the damaging effects of alcohol which would result in increased risk of alcohol-induced intestinal leak that could lead to organ damage using organoids generated from individuals with and without post-COVID-19 and/or AUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study seeks to understand the role of alcohol consumption in COVID-19 long-term complications, hypothesizing that alcohol is an underappreciated risk factor for developing these complications. We also hypothesize that these effects are related to alcohol's ability to cause gut-leakiness during human diseases. The completion of this proposal may identify alcohol misuse (a modifiable lifestyle factor) as a yet unknown risk factor for COVID-19 long-term complications; therefore, it may lead to identify individuals at risk for these long-term complications and to design novel strategies to prevent/treat post-COVID-19 syndrome.",Microbiota-Mediated Bidirectional Interactions Between Alcohol Misuse and Post-COVID-19 Syndrome,10392167,R01AA029859,"['2019-nCoV', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 long hauler', 'COVID-19 mortality', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug usage', 'Endotoxins', 'Enrollment', 'Feces', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leaky Gut', 'Link', 'Long COVID', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recovery', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'United States', 'Virus', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'arm', 'associated symptom', 'coronavirus disease', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'immune activation', 'immune system function', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'intestinal barrier', 'learning classifier', 'lipopolysaccharide-binding protein', 'low socioeconomic status', 'microbiota', 'modifiable lifestyle factors', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'patient screening', 'patient subsets', 'phosphatidylethanol', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'response', 'severe COVID-19', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'zonulin']",NIAAA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,215870
"Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder ABSTRACT This application represents our ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of substance use disorders (SUDs). This research is achieved through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data that combine clinical symptoms and diagnoses, imaging markers, and genotypes. The team has a PI with expertise in computational science and the development and implementation of innovative statistical algorithms to understand multidimensional data; a PI with extensive experience in systems, imaging and addiction neuroscience; and a co-I who has expertise in the genetics of SUDs. Our previous R01 project employed a sample of ~12,000 individuals aggregated from multiple genetic studies of alcohol and drug dependence to generate SUD subtypes based on clinical symptoms. Because clinical manifestations are distal endpoints in the biological pathway, the genetic effects identified are often weak and inconsistent, and consequently difficult to detect even in large samples. As championed by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) research, the etiologies of psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, can be fruitfully characterized by dimensional neural features. This project thus extends our ongoing work to include imaging neural features in the classification of SUDs. Specifically, we will utilize a large database from the UK Biobank Project that provides both genetic and multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Building on our work with the US Human Connectome Project, we aim in the current project to integrate clinical, imaging, and genotype data to investigate the neurobiological substrates of SUD diagnostic labels, and to derive SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. Methodologically, we replace the classic statistical analysis that is confirmatory and biased to an a priori hypothesis by an approach that emphasizes pattern discoveries from big data. Our specific aims are to: (I): identify neuroimaging features that represent robust markers of addiction and differentiate SUD subtypes that can be confirmed by multi-modality evidence; (II) employ a novel brain connectivity model, on the basis of graph convolutional neural networks, to identify neural markers that precisely characterize the differences in structural changes and functional circuits related to SUDs; and (III) derive an innovative machine learning model to identify highly heritable neurobiological subtypes of SUDs that facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of addiction. We will focus on alcohol and nicotine use disorders to demonstrate the conceptual and methodological approaches. We believe that, by providing a productive conceptual and methodological platform to integrate imaging and genetic data to understand the etiologies of SUDs, this research is highly responsive to the RFA “Leveraging Big Data Science to Elucidate the Neural Mechanisms of Addiction and SUD.” The machine learning tools developed for this project will provide an innovative and reliable foundation to enhance the aggregation and analysis of multidimensional data, and to meet the diagnostic and predictive challenges in mental health research. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify and differentiate subtypes of alcohol and nicotine use disorders by combining neural markers, genotype data, and clinical diagnostic information. The proposed analytics will be tested in a large database of alcohol and nicotine use disorders from the UK Biobank project.

"Identifying specific genetic pathway interactions for drug use and abuse through integrative omics PROJECT SUMMARY  Cannabis use disorders (CUD) are prevalent in the U.S., and highly comorbid with other substance use disorders (SUD) such as alcohol use disorder (AUD), as well as with other mental health problems. While the etiology of cannabis use/misuse have both environmental and genetic components, cannabis use and problematic use are found to be highly heritable. Thus, studies that identify the genetic risk factors for CUD in the general U.S. populations, and in the high-risk populations, are of high public health importance. However, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods are sparse and appear to have only captured a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorder. One key challenge in addiction genetics is how to identify genetic interactions and epistatic regulations that may play a more important role in determining risk for addictive behaviors than what gene variants do individually, and that may help explain a critical part of the missing link. Genetic interactions have rarely been systematically considered in studies of substance use, primarily due to lack of statistical power and shortage of computational methodology. To address the challenge, we propose a framework to systematically detect disease-relevant context specific genetic pathway interactions that underlie the risk for SUD. The framework will be applied to CUD and comorbid AUD to identify crucial genetic interactions and pleiotropic interactions, filling a critical gap in uncovering the genetic architectures of CUD. We will leverage genetic network and pathway topology and integrate multiple layers of omics including genomics, transcriptomic and epigenomic signals in drug abuse relevant tissues. By sharpening the focus on the functionally connected gene and regulation subsets through a priori analyses, we will be able to dramatically boost the statistical power to detect genetic interactions, arrive at highly biologically relevant and readily interpretable findings, and potentially provide clinically actionable insights. The proposed study will utilize outcomes from large GWAS studies for CUD and AUD, together with three high-risk population cohorts with elevated levels of severe cannabis and alcohol use disorders that have whole genome sequence data. We will complement the context specific pathway-level interaction analysis with high-dimensional variable screening machine-learning algorithms to identify both low and high order genetic interactions and regulatory epistatic effects associated with CUD. The findings that are carefully validated using independent study cohorts will be incorporated into a larger disease model of CUD for prediction and potential intervention, and will open up new avenues of research by allowing interrogation of the addiction genetics from a system’s level. The framework will be build in such a way that is readily transferable to other SUD and mental health studies and sets the stage for a genetically and epigenetically informed, precision medicine approach to SUD prevention and treatment. All software developed in the program will be freely available to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cannabis use disorders are highly prevalent in the U.S., and frequently co-occur with alcohol and other substance use disorders. The proposed research seeks to identify and determine how key genomic variants and pathways interact with each other in a disease-relevant tissue specific context to affect an individual’s risk for drug abuse. The obtained knowledge will be incorporated into a larger disease model and lead to more precision in the understanding of the mechanism underlying risk for cannabis use disorders and thus provide a substrate for more effective prevention and intervention.",Identifying specific genetic pathway interactions for drug use and abuse through integrative omics,10294110,DP1DA054373,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Biological', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Tissues', 'addiction', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol use disorder', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'disorder prevention', 'epigenomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana use disorder', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'screening', 'software development', 'substance use', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,DP1,2021,532500
