"Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury Abstract Care partners of persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often required to assume a caregiver role, bearing primary responsibility for assisting the person with TBI in physical, mental, financial, and leisure activities. As a result of these new caregiving responsibilities, it is common for these care partners to report problems with physical, mental, and social health, as well as compromised health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Given that care partners’ well-being and functioning affects both their own personal health outcomes, as well as the functional and rehabilitation outcomes of the person with TBI, there is a critical need to develop novel health management interventions to ensure better health outcomes for both members of the TBI care partnership dyad. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve the health and well-being of these care partners, as well as their ability to provide care to their loved one. Thus, the proposed randomized control trial will examine the efficacy of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), or personalized self-management intervention that uses objective mobile sensor data feedback to improve physical activity, sleep, and HRQOL in 240 care partners of persons with TBI. Our primary objectives are to: 1) assess the efficacy of this novel personalized self-management intervention (i.e., JITAI) for preventing the development of adverse symptoms (e.g., mobility, sleep, poor HRQOL); and 2) use data collected from wearables (i.e., the Fitbit Charge®) and real-time assessments of HRQOL to identify care partners with the greatest risk for negative physical and mental HRQOL outcomes, as well as the timing for when they are at greatest risk. We expect care partners that are randomized to receive the JITAI will demonstrate improvements in HRQOL, physical activity and sleep relative to controls. We also hypothesize is that objective, data-derived mobile phenotypes can predict risk for adverse caregiver HRQOL. The scientific premise for the proposed research is based on our multidisciplinary team with expertise in caregiver research, evaluation of HRQOL using patient-reported outcomes, clinical trials implementation, expertise in real time assessment of HRQOL, as well as the statistical expertise in high- dimensional statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, the innovation is grounded in the examination of a real-time, real-world, personalized and scalable JITAI designed to improve HRQOL in care partners. Ultimately, this study will allow us to identify care partners at the greatest risk for negative physical and mental health outcomes, and will provide important efficacy data to support the clinical utility of a low cost, low burden self-management intervention to improve HRQOL for care partners of persons with TBI. Narrative Care partners of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often faced with considerable physical and emotional stress resulting from their caregiver role; not surprisingly, this stress is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes for both the care partner and the person for whom they provide care. Given this, interventions focused on improving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these care partners will likely have positive downstream effects for the care recipient. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a personalized self-management intervention designed to promote care partner self-care; this intervention uses physical activity and sleep data collected using a Fitbit® and real-time self-reports of HRQOL collected via a mobile phone app, to provide care partners with personalized feedback via app alert four times per week.",Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury,10110031,R01NR013658,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Beds', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Emotional Stress', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Financial Activity', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Heart', 'Home', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Leisure Activities', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care recipients', 'care systems', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'clinical trial implementation', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'fitbit', 'functional outcomes', 'group intervention', 'health assessment', 'health management', 'health related quality of life', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loved ones', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'poor sleep', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sleep health', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tv watching']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,592501
"Global and Local Genetic Ancestry Impacts on Differential Outcome of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Multiple Sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of our study is to identify ancestry related genetic variants contributing to differential risk of manifestations of both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS) in subjects of different genetic ancestries. SLE is an autoimmune disease with heterogenous features characterized by autoantibody formation and MS is an immune-mediated, demyelinating disorder. We will investigate the association between genetic ancestry and clinical outcomes of SLE and MS that are known to differ in prevalence and severity between SLE or MS patients of different races. Outcomes for SLE will include age of onset, autoantibody status, and lupus nephritis. Outcomes for MS will include age of onset, cognitive impairment, and MS severity score. We will study ~4,000 SLE and MS cases. In Aim 1, we will use ~2,000 SLE cases from the UCSF Lupus Genetics Study and California Lupus Epidemiology Study (CLUES) and ~2,000 MS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) MS Research Program and Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) MS Sunshine Study to investigate the association of global ancestry and the outcomes of interest for SLE and MS. In Aim 2, we will investigate the association of local ancestry genome-wide and of candidate SLE and MS SNPs with the same clinical outcomes. In Aim 3, we will test for the association between both active and passive tobacco smoking and respective outcomes as well as test for gene-environment interaction between active and passive smoking and global and local ancestry. By establishing whether global and local genetic ancestry contribute to clinical heterogeneity and severity of SLE and MS, or if there are differences in gene-environment interaction with environmental exposures such as smoking, we might be able to target patients based on risk of disease outcomes by evaluating genetic ancestry of admixed patients. It might also be possible to predict disease manifestations and allow for early intervention and improved targeted treatment strategies limiting severity of disease and improving quality of life. This research project and associated training plan were developed in collaboration with my sponsor, Dr. Lisa Barcellos, co-sponsors, Drs. Lindsey Criswell and Laura Fejerman, and collaborators, Drs. Andres Cardenas and Priya Moorjani. The training plan emphasizes scientific productivity and building a strong knowledge of epidemiologic, biostatistical, and computational methods, as well as immunology and SLE and MS autoimmune disease processes. As a student at UC Berkeley, I am well supported by an institution that values rigorous scientific research and have access to many research and professional resources. Ultimately, the proposed research and achievement of the goals outlined in the training plan will allow me to become a multidisciplinary, independent investigator and facilitate my transition into a post-doctoral position and early-investigator faculty or research position. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS) have debilitating clinical features which vary between different ancestral populations. Since disease manifestations may differ by genetic ancestry, understanding the effect of genetic ancestry and interactions with active and passive tobacco smoking exposure on clinical outcomes of SLE and MS is an important step towards predicting disease outcomes and allowing for early intervention and treatment for different ancestral populations.",Global and Local Genetic Ancestry Impacts on Differential Outcome of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Multiple Sclerosis,10315167,F31MD015673,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Amerindian', 'Asians', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Cause of Death', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'European', 'Faculty', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Mediating', 'Modification', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Passive Smoking', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Students', 'Study Subject', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multi-ethnic', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'programs', 'smoking exposure', 'social', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment strategy', 'whole genome']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2021,41993
"Compounded Neuronal Damage in Comorbid Cigarette Smoking and Addiction Abstract The negative health consequences of cigarette smoking (CS) are indisputable: extensive heart and lung damage and significant risk for multiple types of cancer. Similarly, the addictive properties of CS are also well- documented. Epidemiological studies have repeatedly shown that cigarette addiction is highly comorbid with alcohol and other substance use disorders (AUD, SUD). Discussions of these data typically center around concern for the serious peripheral health consequences of smoking and/or risk for relapse for AUD/SUD. While these are worthy topics of inquiry, the current state of the literature has failed to address several critical points: first, while smoking rates are decreasing in the general U.S. population, they remain high in AUD/SUD. Second, while we know that the toxic compounds in combustible tobacco products are highly likely to induce brain damage, we do not yet have an understanding of putative dose-response functions of smoking history and current CS status on markers of neural damage. Third, it is not known how lifetime CS exposure interacts with other addictions at the level of brain structure and biochemistry to produce behavior: this could be key for discovering how the cycle of comorbid addictions is perpetuated, and thus is crucial for advancing treatment and predicting outcomes. Recently, a wealth of neuroimaging studies have emerged that have examined brain structure in chronic smokers. However, the majority of these studies looked at single outcome variables, only considered cigarette addiction, and did not design the studies from a perspective of a brain damage hypothesis. What are missing is information derived from comprehensive, multi-modal studies that attempt to understand the caustic effects of CS on the brain, and data that inform us of how CS exposure may compound effects of and complicate outcomes in CS comorbid with AUD/SUD. Lack of such knowledge is an important, clinically relevant problem, as it prevents us from developing targeted, mechanism-driven therapies designed to promote both smoking cessation and alcohol/drug abstinence, and to mitigate or repair brain damage from CS. We propose to address this critical knowledge gap by applying state-of-the art neuroimaging technologies to determine how the lifetime dose response function of CS exerts negative consequences on the brain in AUD. We will conduct parallel studies at the Indiana University School of Medicine and Stanford. Both sites will recruit the following samples: never-smoking controls, currently-smoking controls, never-smoking AUD, former-smoking AUD, and currently-smoking AUD. All AUD subjects will be nontreatment-seeking and active drinkers. We will test the effects of lifetime CS exposure on brain metabolites (Aim 1), white matter tract integrity (Aim 2), and brain network function (Aim 3). Exploratory Aim 4 will develop a predictively valid model of the relative contributions of CS-mediated brain damage on neurocognition and drinking behaviors. The dual-site design maximizes the power of the study by sampling two geographically distinct populations, and has a built-in replication component that is crucial, but often not realized in human neuroimaging studies. Project Narrative There is a very high rate of cigarette smoking in individuals with an alcohol use disorder (AUD), however, we know very little about how the combination of hazardous alcohol use and cigarette smoking impact brain health and cognition. This application will use several advanced brain imaging techniques to understand the additive adverse effects of smoking on brain chemistry, structure, and function and cognition in AUD. The outcomes of this work will help speed development of treatments for both alcohol and cigarette addiction.",Compounded Neuronal Damage in Comorbid Cigarette Smoking and Addiction,10240491,R01AA026014,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Anisotropy', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Caustics', 'Chronic', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Inositol', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Peripheral', 'Poison', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Smoking Status', 'Speed', 'Structural Biochemistry', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain health', 'brain repair', 'cancer type', 'cigarette addiction', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinically relevant', 'combustible tobacco', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'dimensional analysis', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'drug/alcohol abstinence', 'epidemiology study', 'former smoker', 'heart damage', 'lung injury', 'medical schools', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'never smoker', 'never smoking', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relapse risk', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'smoking addiction', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking exposure', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tobacco products', 'white matter']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,521609
"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,10294298,R00DA046564,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Center', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social Environment', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'craving', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'secondary analysis', 'sensor', 'standard care', 'supervised learning', 'trend', 'wearable device']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2021,248999
"Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers PROJECT SUMMARY  The purpose of this study is to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that link acute alcohol intoxication with cigarette use in young nondaily smokers (ages 21-25). Nondaily smokers experience fewer symptoms of cigarette withdrawal than daily smokers; however, they still experience difficulty quitting. Since smoking cessation before the age of 30 substantially attenuates the long-term health consequences associated with smoking, understanding the factors that motivate cigarette use in young nondaily smokers and developing tailored interventions will be critical for curbing cigarette use and improving public health. The proposed project will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine how acute alcohol intoxication impacts brain function and will assess the extent to which alcohol-induced changes in brain function correlate with impulsive choice, cigarette craving, and craving regulation in young adults. Furthermore, we will assess how alcohol-induced changes in brain function, impulsivity, craving, and capacity for craving regulation predict cigarette use over the course of 1 year.  This K01 application advances the PI's long-term research goal of establishing an independent line of research examining neurobiological markers that confer risk for future substance use disorder using multimodal neuroimaging techniques. The proposed training plan will enable the PI to develop skills and expertise in five primary areas: 1) design and implementation of longitudinal studies, 2) task-based and resting- state fMRI, 3) advanced statistical methods, 4) the assessment of acute neurobiological responses to drugs and 5) the neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive choice. The training program combines formal coursework with mentorship from experienced consultants who are experts in the proposed areas of training. This project will leverage the intellectual and institutional support at OHSU and in Dr. Nagel's Developmental Brain Imaging Laboratory in order to develop a new line of research that will form the foundation for a career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although rates of cigarette use are declining, the proportion of nondaily smokers is rising, particularly among young adults. Among young adults, nondaily smoking is associated with negative health consequences and, for some, may lead to the establishment of life-long smoking patterns. The goal of this project is to understand the behavioral, psychological and neurobiological factors that contribute to cigarette use in nondaily smokers to aid the development of tailored evidence-based interventions.",Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers,10125984,K01DA046649,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Beverages', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cigarette', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol response', 'base', 'career', 'cigarette craving', 'cigarette smoking', 'craving', 'design', 'discounting', 'drinking', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'problem drinker', 'psychologic', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking intervention', 'statistical and machine learning', 'therapeutic target', 'young adult']",NIDA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,183179
"Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed research is to discover neurobiologically interpretable gene networks for addiction, specifically for cigarettes and opioids. To achieve this goal, we will apply a new multi-omics, multi-method framework—Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetII)—to identify gene networks associated uniquely with cigarette or opioid outcomes and networks shared across these addictions. GNetII includes genome-wide epistasis, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, gene network construction, and Lines-of-Evidence methods. These cornerstone methods will enable integration of large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in living subjects, postmortem human brain data (RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and variant genotypes) from addiction case and control decedents (deceased individuals), and public omics data. Cigarette smoking and opioid outcomes are genetically correlated, and we have parallel GWAS and multi-omics brain data available in two highly relevant tissues, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, for both of these addictions. Cigarettes and opioids are leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. These addictions affect millions of U.S. adults and youths and are highly heritable (e.g., 54% and 71% for opioid addiction and nicotine dependence, respectively). GWAS analyses have identified 300+ loci at genome-wide significance for smoking. GWAS for opioids are farther behind in sample size, but genome-wide significant loci are emerging. Neurobiological effects of known loci are largely unknown, and more loci and connections among the loci are still to be discovered. We hypothesize that applying new big data science methods to large-scale GWAS and gene regulation data in brain tissue will reveal previously undetected relationships (such as epistatic interactions between genes) and add knowledge of the neurobiology underlying addiction. We propose the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Integrate multi-omics data to discover cigarette-associated gene networks.  Aim 2: Integrate multi-omics data to discover opioid-associated gene networks.  Aim 3: Integrate multi-omics data to find general addiction-associated gene networks. For cigarettes, Aims 1 and 3 will leverage GWAS (N=528,259) and multi-omics data in postmortem human brain from active smoker and nonsmoker decedents (N=262). For opioids, Aims 2 and 3 will use GWAS (N=49,178) and multi-omics brain data from opioid overdose case and control decedents (N=147). Analyses will be performed on Summit, the world's fastest supercomputer, which will greatly improve the likelihood of neurobiologically meaningful discoveries. Our study will capture complex networks across the genome to find previously unknown genes, as well as help explain the neurobiological underpinnings for the growing number of genetic loci associated with cigarette or opioid outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Addictions to cigarettes and opioids are public health epidemics. The goal of this study is to identify gene networks that predispose individuals to these addictions. We will leverage cutting-edge methods (such as Explainable Artificial Intelligence), large-scale genome-wide association data in living subjects, and multiple omics data in postmortem human brain to further our understanding of the neurobiology underlying addiction.",Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids.,10267762,R01DA051913,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cigarette', 'Complex', 'Cotinine', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Epidemic', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Oranges', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'base', 'big-data science', 'brain tissue', 'case control', 'cigarette addiction', 'cigarette smoking', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'non-smoker', 'novel', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'random forest', 'smoking addiction', 'smoking initiation', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'young adult']",NIDA,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2021,588225
"Racial disparities in biomarkers, tobacco cessation, and smoking relapse in association with electronic cigarette use Project Summary Although enormous progress has been made in reducing cigarette smoking in the United States, large disparities remain across subpopulations such as racial minorities. Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of disease and early death. However, African Americans (AA) are less likely to quit smoking successfully than are non-Hispanic Whites, and they are also three times more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than Whites. There is a remarkable variation in the incidence of lung cancer due to cigarette smoking among racial/ethnic groups in the United States, and African Americans have significantly greater risks than Whites at lower levels of smoking. Tobacco use landscape is changing among U.S. adults with an estimated 4.5% of adults aged 18 years and older reporting current use of electronic cigarettes (EC). Evidence suggests that e-cigarette aerosol is substantially less toxic than combustible cigarette smoking, but e-cigarette use may also post elevated risk for former smokers to relapse back to combustible cigarette smoking. Biomarker can play an important role in assessing the potential health effects of tobacco products and studies have found that AA have higher levels of serum cotinine per cigarette smoked, higher urinary amount of TNE and NNAL than Whites. However, evidence on the racial disparities of biomarker outcomes of EC use is scarce, especially whether and to what extent they are different from use of various EC devices, flavors, and transitions in EC ↔ cigarettes. The overarching goal of this study is to examine the racial disparities in biomarkers of exposure and toxicants in association with EC use by analyzing the restricted Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Wave 1-4 biomarker data. We will link the biomarker data with the PATH adult surveys to identify the between- person and within-person differences in biomarkers by use of different vaping products, flavors, and transition in EC and combustible cigarettes across different waves (Aim 1). We will further leverage machine learning algorithms to develop a composite bio (biomarker)-socio (socio-demographics) -psycho (psychosocial factors) risk index score for each racial/ethnic group to predict subsequent abstinence from cigarette smoking and relapse to cigarette smoking since these 2 outcomes represent the most meaningful transitions from a public health perspective. This study is innovative in its focus on racial disparities of biomarkers by leveraging the nationally longitudinal data, and on using machine learning algorithms to predict future smoking cessation and relapse behaviors in EC ↔ cigarette transition. Fulfillment of these aims will build a scientific base for maximizing the value of existing biospecimen collections. Findings from this R21 study are expected to inform regulatory strategies to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and set the stage for a future R01 application that will develop personalized intervention strategies that incorporate biomarker measures to reduce racial disparities in tobacco use and improve health outcomes. 1 Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine racial disparities in biomarkers of e-cigarette use by linking the PATH Waves 1-4 restricted biomarker data and adult survey data. The study will extend our knowledge on the heterogeneity in biomarkers of exposure and toxicants across racial and ethnic groups, including use of different vaping products, flavors, and transition between e-cigarettes and cigarettes.

"The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD Project Summary To reduce the increasing societal and financial burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), prevention is critical. Even small improvements of the modifiable dementia risk factors on the individual level have the potential to lead to a substantial reduction of dementia cases at the population level. The disease processes occur for years though symptoms typically appear after age 60. Thus, identifying those at risk early for intervention is crucial. Studies among adults aged 60 years and older have identified performance-based measures of impairment in physical function as early indicators of ADRD, three or more years prior to onset. To improve earlier prediction of ADRD, we need research on adults aged 51-59 years to assess the relationship between physical functional impairment and likelihood of ADRD onset years later. Further, given the burden of administering performance-based measures of physical function, it would be advantageous to use patient- reported metrics of limitation in physical function for ADRD prediction. We propose using the 1998-2018 nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) of adults aged 51-59 years to determine the extent to which patient-reported measures of function would facilitate efficient ADRD risk identification. Primary study aims are to: 1) To identify the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function in midlife predict future late-onset ADRD. We will use standardized (RAND HRS) self-reported measures of function and the Langa-Weir ADRD algorithm available in the HRS. Working hypothesis: Limitations in physical function, defined using summary measures of self-reported physical function predict onset of ADRD 4 to 20 years later. 2) Verify that sub-groups of adults, defined by limitations in physical function, aged 51-59 are at higher risk of developing ADRD. We will verify existence of sub-groups (identified in our preliminary analyses) using a computational systems approach (cluster analysis) are predictive of onset of ADRD through 2018, in adjusted analyses. Working hypothesis: Sub-groups of middle-aged adults with unique patterns of limitations in physical function are at higher risk of developing ADRD than those without physical functional deficit 4 to 20 years later, independent of related factors. This proposal addresses the objectives of PAS-19-391 in several ways. First, the Principal investigator (PI), an early stage investigator, is committed to a career in ADRD research. Second, the investigative team has training in non-neurological medical fields and will shift their research focus to ADRD prevention within their fields. Third, the PI has experience with an existing dataset (HRS); and will use it to assess age-related changes in non-cognitive processes that may be early signs of ADRD. Finally, the PI published an HRS study reporting that physical functional decline precedes the onset of diabetes, a risk factor for ADRD. Our proposal builds on this work. The successful completion of the proposed study will ascertain the extent to which self-reported impairment in physical function during midlife, predicts future ADRD, thereby offering a new, efficient mechanism for early identification of ADRD. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple worldwide by 2050 unless effective measures to treat or delay the onset of the disease are implemented.1 The same study found that about 35% of ADRD could be delayed or prevented through modifiable health and lifestyle factors from different phases of life. To identify adults at risk of ADRD early, our study among adults aged 51-59 seeks to determine the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function are early indicators of ADRD and to identify sub-groups of people with unique patterns of limitation in physical function that are early indicators of ADRD.",The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD,10106121,R03AG070668,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Blood', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Financial Hardship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Activity', 'Muscle', 'Nursing Homes', 'Observational Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive measure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Subjects Selections', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'dementia risk', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'grasp', 'high risk', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'performance based measurement', 'prevent']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,287889
"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure. We formed a multi- disciplinary team to employ computational machine learning to explore the multi-omics data obtained from MoTrPAC to identify the potential molecule(s) followed by the state-of-the-art gene editing in mice to elucidate how this molecule(s) could transduce the health benefits of physical activity.",Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity,10264175,U01AG070960,"['Acute', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrinogen', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Promotion', 'Health protection', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Ligands', 'Liver', 'Liver Circulation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Solid', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Mice', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'endurance exercise', 'exercise capacity', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'gain of function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mental function', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'paracrine', 'phenotypic data', 'phosphoproteomics', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'skeletal', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutically effective', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,U01,2021,521758
"Unraveling the intersection of synaptic biology, lifestyle, and cognitive resilience PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Brain pathology begins accumulating in early adulthood and is detectable in almost all brains by older age. Yet, there is remarkable heterogeneity in cognitive aging, and most aged adults do not evidence cognitive impairment or dementia. Uncovering the naturally occurring processes that support this cognitive resilience to neuropathology burden may yield potent targets to prevent or slow Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). We hypothesize that maintained synaptic integrity and physical activity may represent two such protective factors. Synaptic communication is the foundational underpinning of cognition. Increasing data suggest that preserved synaptic integrity may support clinical functioning regardless of pathology presence or etiology. Further, physical activity is a highly implicated resilience behavior that has also been linked to synaptic maintenance in animals. Our goal is to determine the synaptic biology that may underlie cognitive resilience and physical activity in humans. We will collaborate across two ADRC programs to leverage their unique strengths. In the Rush Memory and Aging Project (R-MAP), brain tissue samples from autopsied adults followed in life will be used to quantify >150 synaptic protein markers (n=869). In the UCSF Memory and Aging Center (UC-MAC), cerebrospinal fluid samples from longitudinally followed living older adults will be used to quantify seven synaptic protein markers (n=200). Both cohorts complete longitudinal actigraphy monitoring as an index of physical activity levels, and comprehensive neurobehavioral assessments. Cognitive resilience will be operationalized as the discrepancy between neuropathology markers and cognitive performances. Aim one will identify the in-depth synaptic networks (R-MAP) and the longitudinal, dynamic nature (UC-MAC) between synaptic markers and cognitive resilience. Aim two will apply innovative machine learning techniques to identify precise actigraphy features that most robustly relate to in-depth synaptic networks (R-MAP), longitudinal synaptic marker changes (UC-MAC), and cognitive resilience (both). Accomplishing these aims will significantly impact the ADRD field. We are designed to carefully identify synaptic and exercise features that support sustained cognitive resilience using cutting edge measurement technologies, analytics, and exceptional collaborative expertise. This proposal represents a bridging between two national ADRCs to more powerfully address high impact questions than could be answered by either individually. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching goal of this proposal is to better understand the biological and behavioral processes that support sustained cognitive resilience to brain aging. Successful completion of our collaborative project will more precisely determine the role of synaptic integrity and physical activity as candidate therapeutic targets to help prevent and slow Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).","Unraveling the intersection of synaptic biology, lifestyle, and cognitive resilience",10214288,R01AG072475,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Dominant Genetic Conditions', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Role', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'end of life', 'human old age (65+)', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurogranin', 'neuronal pentraxin', 'neuropathology', 'preservation', 'presynaptic', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'protein biomarkers', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'synaptic function', 'tau Proteins', 'theories', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,892644
"Machine learning for analysis of walking patterns and physical activity in knee osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) exhibit altered walking patterns that cause repetitive, abnormal forces on the knee joint, leading to disease progression. Existing interventions to reduce knee loading during walking have not resulted in meaningful change in knee OA symptoms or joint structure. A key limitation of existing research has been the use of simplified metrics to describe walking patterns and not accounting for walking amount and intensity (i.e. physical activity). The goal of this research is to comprehensively characterize walking patterns and activity in people with and without knee OA and to assess the associations of walking with 2-year change in knee OA outcomes. Machine learning approaches will be used to analyze ground reaction force (GRF) data and accelerometer-derived physical activity metrics in an existing, large, well- characterized cohort (n=2575) from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST). Machine learning approaches that use selected features and those that are agnostic and utilize all available information from time-varying GRFs will be used in combination with physical activity metrics to classify symptomatic and structural change. The results from machine learning approaches will be compared to those of common statistical approaches. This research will allow for characterization of the complex relationships between walking patterns and activity, providing novel insights into OA disease processes. Further, this research will provide valuable training in applying machine learning approaches to biomechanics data and may inform patient-specific strategies to optimize walking patterns and physical activity for personalized knee OA management.  The principal investigator will leverage prior training in biomedical engineering applied to OA research to further advance her skills in traditional and agnostic machine learning approaches for analyses of biomechanics and physical activity data. The sponsor and co-sponsor at Boston University (BU) will provide mentorship in clinical aspects of OA, implementation of the proposed studies in a large cohort, grantsmanship, and career development. The team will work with a collaborator in computational biomedicine at BU with expertise in machine learning to achieve the scientific and training goals of this project. In addition to hands-on training, the principal investigator will enroll in didactic coursework and workshops at BU related to machine learning and computer programming. Other key aspects of training include participation in research and networking opportunities at BU and other local Institutions, as well as national and international meetings. The sponsors and the Institution provide an environment where the PI will work and learn as a part of a diverse and interdisciplinary team of OA researchers across rehabilitation, rheumatology, epidemiology, computational methods, and imaging specialties. This postdoctoral training environment will prepare the principal investigator for a career as an independent researcher with expertise in machine learning approaches as applied to biomechanics for the study of musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis. Narrative This research will use machine learning to understand how walking patterns and physical activity in people with knee osteoarthritis are related to pain and disease worsening.

"A Smartphone Intervention for Pregnancy Smoking Cessation with Peer Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Tobacco smoking among women in Romania increased dramatically, by close to 30%, between 2011-2018 and the share of smokers with quit attempts decreased by 37%. Tobacco kills more than 8 million people a year around the world. The burden of tobacco-related illness and death is heaviest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Romania, where 80% of the worldwide 1.1 billion smokers live. Our work showed that 30% of women smoke pre-pregnancy in Romania and half of the smokers continue during pregnancy. It is critically important to address tobacco smoking during pregnancy, an extraordinary window of opportunity for sustained cessation. The objectives of this application are to develop, implement, and test the feasibility and effectiveness of an adaptive mobile pregnancy tobacco cessation app-based intervention using deep tailoring and a self-nominated support person, and to build mHealth research capacity in Romania. We build on our pregnancy smoking cessation trials with spousal support in Romania, including the ongoing Smoke Free Together (SFT1.0) mHealth pilot trial and the Quit Together telephone counseling trial that shows preliminary evidence of efficacy, and on our partnerships in Romania. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will show evidence of feasibility and effectiveness in increasing positive support, pregnancy cessation, and postnatal abstinence. The app will be novel in its use of the unique functionality of smartphones, use of reinforcement learning (RL) and deep tailoring to continuously adapt the intervention, the emphasis on increasing positive support, and the use of the app by both smoker and quit-partner. The aims are: 1. (R21 phase). Develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of the SFT2.0 app-based mobile smoking cessation intervention with quit-partner support during pregnancy and postpartum in Romania; 2. (R33 phase). Test the SFT2.0 app-based smoking cessation intervention in a hybrid effectiveness and implementation randomized controlled trial; 3. (R21 and R33 phases). Develop mHealth research capacity by enhancing individual and institutional research capabilities in Romania and expanding the existing international research network. With respect to expected outcomes, the proposed application is anticipated to advance understanding of the effectiveness and implementation of a smartphone-based app for pregnancy smoking cessation with quit- partner support. Such results are anticipated to have a system wide sustainable positive impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal smoking as the intervention has a high potential to be adopted in the universal health system in Romania, with applications to the US and other populations. The development of the international research network and the individual and institutional mHealth research capacity building is expected to positively impact mHealth research in CEE and the neighboring region. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the findings will have a system wide sustainable impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal tobacco smoking in Romania and in Central and Eastern Europe, with applications to the US and other populations. The research is also expected to have an important impact on the methodology and design of mobile technology clinical and public health interventions during the reproductive years with lifelong potential implications. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help enhance health and reduce the burdens of human illness.",A Smartphone Intervention for Pregnancy Smoking Cessation with Peer Support,10231252,R21HD103039,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Couples', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Eastern Europe', 'Effectiveness', 'Friends', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Tests', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Romania', 'Self Determination', 'Series', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Spouses', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'adaptive learning', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'craving', 'design', 'feasibility testing', 'iterative design', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'offspring', 'peer support', 'pilot trial', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal cigarette smoking', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'reproductive', 'smoking abstinence', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking during pregnancy', 'telephone coaching', 'theories', 'tobacco control', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,1000
"mHealth-based Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Physical Activity Levels of Individuals with Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary The lack of regular physical activity (PA) in over 290,000 individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States (US) is an ongoing health crisis. This lack of activity has potentially devastating consequences because low levels of PA in people with SCI elevates the risk of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and lung disease. Furthermore, low levels of PA in individuals with SCI have been associated with secondary conditions such as pain, fatigue, weight gain, and deconditioning. Regular PA and exercise-based interventions have been linked with improved outcomes and healthier lifestyles among those with SCI. Sensor- based activity monitors can assess PA and exercise interventions by quantifying wheelchair movement, movement of the individual, and physiological changes. However, these monitors do not provide real-time, tailored feedback and recommendations that might help individuals with SCI increase their PA levels in the community. The overarching goal of this proposal is to evaluate a sensor-enabled, just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) strategy to increase and sustain PA levels among individuals with SCI in their communities. The long-term goal of this research is to effectively integrate a mobile health JITAI with existing PA intervention programs to motivate health-related behavior change in individuals with SCI. A primary objective of this proposal is to extend our pilot work to evaluate the integration of a JITAI with a web-based 14-week PA intervention program from the National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability (Aim 1). We hypothesize that the integration of web-based PA intervention program with JITAI will result in significantly higher PA levels over 14 weeks compared to the standard we-based PA intervention program alone. A secondary objective of this study is to extend existing algorithms that use commercial wearable technology to robustly detect PA behaviors to facilitate the delivery of tailored just-in-time actionable feedback and PA recommendations for individuals with SCI (Aims 3 and 4). The integration of the JITAI, which provides feedback and PA recommendations due to sensor-based assessments of PA, with the standard web-based PA intervention program will be tested via a clinical trial that combines a randomized controlled trial and a micro-randomized trial. Our team includes investigators with expertise in SCI research, mobile health, PA tracking, and behavioral change interventions. The proposed study will yield novel insights about JITAIs and JITAIs combined with more traditional, web-based PA intervention programs, which will help researchers design engaging PA interventions for individuals with disability in the community that may improve their health and quality of life. Project Narrative The lack of regular physical activity in over 290,000 individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the US is an ongoing health crisis.

"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",10083209,U24DK112331,"['ATAC-seq', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'epigenomics', 'exercise intervention', 'experience', 'fitness', 'gene product', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput analysis', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual response', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'methylome', 'mortality risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sedentary', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web page', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2021,3913893
"Multivariable Artificial Pancreas System to Detect and Mitigate the Effects of Unannounced Physical Activities and Acute Psychological Stress IIT Project Summary/Abstract The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate a viable, functionally integrated multivariable artificial pancreas that will mitigate meal, physical activity and acute psychological stress challenges without any manual inputs to better regulate glucose levels of people with diabetes. The first generation of artificial pancreas (AP) systems, the hybrid closed-loop AP, collects data from continuous glucose monitoring devices and relies on manual user inputs for mitigating the effects of meals and physical activities. Acute psychological stress and many other physical activities besides planned exercise can affect blood glucose levels and cause challenges to maintaining euglycemia for people with type 1 diabetes. Various physical activities and acute psychological stress events affect the metabolism and sensitivity to insulin in different ways. Hence, their types, intensities and durations, and their individual and concurrent presence must be detected in order to determine the optimal insulin administration. The multivariable artificial pancreas approach provides a well-integrated and user-friendly technology with minimal burden on the user and mitigates the effects of unexpected physical activities and acute psychological stress inducements. Additionally, this technology would be safer by reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, compared to APs based exclusively on continuous glucose monitoring device data. Such multivariable AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that uses real-time information from continuous glucose monitoring devices and physiological variables obtained from wearable devices worn in free-living daily life. IIT- Project Narrative The multivariable artificial pancreas provides a well-integrated and user-friendly technology with minimal burden on the user and mitigates the effects of unexpected physical activities and acute psychological stress inducements.

"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY Emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. However, engaging in these healthy behaviors peaks during the childhood and adolescent years, and steeply deteriorates into emerging adulthood. Interventions promoting physical activity, reduced sedentary time, and sufficient sleep typically focus on the adoption of these behaviors. Yet, when these interventions are successful, new patterns of behavior are not maintained and typically regress back to baseline levels. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance. To address this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, deliberations, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity, habits) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, reactive processes are difficult to measure using retrospective methods because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct a prospective within- subject case-crossover observational study across a 12-month period. Ethnically-diverse, emerging adults (ages 18-24, N=300) will be recruited from the Happiness & Health Cohort (R01DA033296). We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location, social proximity, voice/text communication) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. These data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within-days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity, ≥120 min sedentary time, ≥7 hr sleep) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learning to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are general, group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and methods from this project will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Initiative’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions.

"Predictors of Effective Scaling: A Meta-Epidemiological Study of Bias in Early-Stage Studies to Prevent Chronic Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Developing behavioral interventions that are both effective/efficacious and that can be scaled is a major challenge in the field of behavioral science. Many behavioral interventions demonstrate early promise in their testing, only to fail to be effective during a larger, more well-powered evaluation. This common pattern (i.e. initial promise then fail) wastes valuable resources and time. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the role of preliminary, early-stage studies (e.g. pilot, feasibility studies) in the development of public health behavioral interventions with attention to internal and external biases introduced during early stage testing. This study will capitalize on developed search strategies and established resources to conduct a series of meta-epidemiological reviews of behavioral interventions targeting adult physical activity and dietary behaviors. In these reviews, behavioral interventions with a published early-stage study and a published, more well-powered trial of the same/similar intervention will be systematically coded for the presence of external and internal validity biases. Meta-regression models will be run to understand how the presence/absence of each bias in early-stage studies, influences the effect size and significance of larger iterations of the intervention. This project’s goal is to inform future physical activity and diet/nutrition behavioral intervention studies, increasing their efficiency and ultimately, the effectiveness of behavioral intervention research to address chronic, non-communicable disease. Aim 1 is to identify the prevalence and impact of external validity biases in a sample of adult physical activity and diet interventions. Aim 2 is to conduct qualitative interviews with lead/senior authors from Aim 1 to better understand the reasons for identified differences/similarities between early-stage and more well-powered studies. Through the execution of this project the following will be gained: extensive skills in systematic-review, meta-analytic techniques, meta-epidemiological methods, qualitative research processes, and scientific communication including peer-reviewed publication, scientific presentation, mentor peer-reviewed, and a drafted post-doctoral grant application. The proposed F31 study is significant because findings from the proposed study will identify characteristics that lead to successful and unsuccessful scaling of well-powered trials, potentially increasing the speed of behavioral intervention development. This study is innovative because it will be among the first to establish the prevalence and impact of external and internal biases in adult physical activity and dietary behavioral interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Emerging evidence suggests external validity biases introduced in early-stage testing of behavioral interventions (e.g. pilot, feasibility studies) are associated with non-significant and/or substantially smaller effects in subsequent larger-scale trials. Failure to produce behavioral interventions that are both effective/efficacious and scalable significantly delays public health progress in the treatment and prevention of non-communicable disease such as obesity and cardiovascular disease. Through a series of rigorous meta-epidemiological studies, this fellowship will examine the presence and impact of internal and external validity biases in early-stage studies and subsequent more well-powered evaluations to provide insight into potential pitfalls during the early-stage testing of diet and physical activity interventions.",Predictors of Effective Scaling: A Meta-Epidemiological Study of Bias in Early-Stage Studies to Prevent Chronic Disease,10229172,F31HL158016,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Beets', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet and Nutrition', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Familiarity', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head Start Program', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Modeling', 'Nursery Schools', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Research', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral health intervention', 'design', 'dietary', 'effectiveness trial', 'epidemiology study', 'exercise intervention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'obesity in children', 'peer coaching', 'pre-doctoral', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'skills', 'statistics', 'systematic review', 'teacher', 'text searching', 'therapy development', 'wasting']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,F31,2021,40416
"Physical Activity in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (ACTiPH) Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by limitation of physical activity even with current effect treatments. Most observational studies, clinical trials, and outpatient clinical assessments of patients with PAH focus on exercise capacity (the maximal effort a person can achieve under controlled circumstances), measured by cardiopulmonary exercise or six minute walk testing. However, these artificial tests do not capture the intensity, frequency, duration, context, and pattern of physical activity throughout the day or week in the patient’s life. Such an activity “signature” or phenotype may more accurately reflect an individual’s function and perceived health-related quality of life (HRQOL) by providing insight into multisystem function, side effects, and treatment benefits and burdens. A physical activity intervention which is personalized for a PAH patient could lead to improvements in psychosocial function, symptoms, HRQOL, fitness, and even survival. Unfortunately, there have been very few published studies of physical activity in PAH patients, none of which have assessed multidimensionality in a large multicenter cohort. We have performed preliminary studies using traditional accelerometry which have shown that patients with PAH cluster into low, medium, and high activity phenotypes which show differences in six minute walk distance and HRQOL. Functional principal components analysis has identified “signatures” of physical activity patterns throughout the day in PAH. Novel biosensors which continuously capture multiple streams of data in real time (including accelerometry) would provide an innovative approach to remote clinical monitoring and may increase the efficiency and pertinence of clinical trials in PAH.  The Pulmonary Hypertension Association Registry (PHAR) has been prospectively collecting data from adult and pediatric PAH patients from centers throughout the United States since 2015. The PHAR has enrolled 1400 patients with 2000 patient-years of follow-up at 52 centers, representing one of the largest multicenter registries of patients with PAH. We propose to measure accelerometry for one week periods biannually for > 1400 patients over four years (~7000 assessments) in the PHAR with high efficiency and low patient burden. We aim to determine the predictors of physical activity phenotype and whether physical activity patterns are associated with health-related quality of life, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and time to lung transplantation or death in PAH. We will estimate the “minimally important difference” in physical activity which could be used as an end point in clinical trials in PAH. We will incorporate a novel wearable biosensor which could be used to advance these models of physical activity in PAH. Project Narrative Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by limitation of physical activity. We will monitor physical activity in a large population of PAH patients in the United States to determine if certain types of activity are particularly beneficial.

"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,10126727,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2021,475626
"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",10246990,R01CA227122,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Cause of Death', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leisures', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Longevity', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'adjudicate', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'vigorous intensity', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,200000
"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,10241985,U01CA229437,"['Aphorisms', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Boredom', 'Cause of Death', 'Cigarette', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health behavior change', 'Home', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer prevention', 'coping', 'craving', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'evidence base', 'field theory', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'novel', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'sensor', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'theories', 'willingness']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,614136
"Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control 7. Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading major cause of preventable death in the United States, and cigarette smoking is a contributor to lung cancer in 80%–90% of cases. Though adult cigarette smoking rates have declined substantially during the past 50 years, they remain as high as 30% in certain groups, such as individuals living in poverty. Quitting is difficult: a given quit attempt results in cessation in fewer than 10% of cases, and most adult cigarette smokers have attempted and failed to quit, and often many times. What is urgently needed are novel interventions for cigarette smoking cessation that operate through different mechanisms from those targeted by existing interventions, which are likely to have been unsuccessful for persistent smokers. A barrier to progress is that the mechanisms of action of most treatments are not known, which makes it difficult to know which treatment will work best for whom. We turn to affective science to identify a candidate technique that could serve as the basis for a novel intervention. Research on affect regulation typically focuses on down- regulation of affective states, such as craving for cigarettes, using effortful strategies such as cognitive reappraisal. However, a new insight in affect regulation is that people can construe, or subjectively understand, events with varying levels of abstraction, and that construing health-related behaviors in high- versus low-level terms promotes health behavior in several domains. For example, smokers who want to quit are more likely to resist a cigarette when they construe the same event (e.g., “abstinence”) in more abstract, high-level terms (e.g., “becoming a better me”) versus more concrete, low-level terms (e.g., “not smoking this cigarette”). There is some evidence that high-level construal might rely on distinct mechanisms from traditional affect regulation and smoking reduction interventions, but its mechanisms of action are unknown. Directly comparing its mechanisms to those of alternative affect regulation strategies and developing tools to induce high-level construal are the next steps on the path toward developing a novel intervention. Also, establishing individual differences in the effects of high-level construal will allow future interventions to be targeted to the individuals for whom they will be maximally effective. We identified two candidate mechanisms through which high-level construal might operate: down-regulation of craving and up-regulation of goal energization (i.e., motivation to quit). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed the neural systems engaged by those processes to be distinct. So, we will use multivariate analyses of fMRI data to quantify the similarity of high-level construal to each candidate (Aim 1). This will be done in a longitudinal translational experiment with 4 conditions—high- level construal, down-regulation of craving, up-regulation of goal energization, and treatment-as-usual—in a sample of persistent smokers in poverty, who are the most likely to benefit from a novel, theory-based treatment. The sample size (N = 240) affords an examination of individual differences in the effect of high-level construal on neural activity and craving, and the degree to which they predict smoking reduction (Aim 2). 8. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking is among the leading causes of preventable death in the United States because smoking increases risk for lung cancer and various diseases. Though U.S. smoking rates have declined, a substantial percentage of adults, particularly those living in poverty who have repeatedly tried and failed to quit, still smoke and therefore could benefit from novel interventions for cessation that operate through different mechanisms than those of traditional treatments. This study will use neuroimaging to uncover the mechanisms of action of a promising strategy for affect regulation and smoking cessation and also build profiles of individuals for whom this strategy does and does not work, thereby providing tangible and practical information that public health professionals and clinicians can use to inform personalized treatments for cigarette smoking cessation.",Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control,10127602,R01CA240452,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medial', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cigarette craving', 'cigarette smoking', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cost', 'craving', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'insight', 'lens', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'preventable death', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'theories', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,595543
"Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers” 7. Project Summary We will test Adapt2Quit, an innovative Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational Messaging System. Adapt2Quit uses complex, machine-learning algorithms to adaptively select the best messages for a smoker, based upon multiple attributes, including: 1) the smoker’s profile; 2) the smoker’s explicit feedback over time to the system; and 3) data from thousands of prior smokers’ profiles and their feedback patterns. Adapt2Quit’s type of machine- learning is called a recommender system. Outside healthcare, companies (like Amazon) use recommender systems to continuously learn from user feedback (e.g.: liked product, products purchased) to improve, thus enhancing personal relevance and customer engagement. Engagement is a huge challenge for digital health. In the field of computer-tailored health messaging, Adapt2Quit is the first to use machine-learning to continuously adapt to feedback and select new personalized messages to send to smokers. To evaluate the impact of the recommender system, Adapt2Quit will be compared with a robust, active control, a simple but effective messaging system. In our pilot experiment, Adapt2Quit outperformed the control, especially among socio- economically disadvantaged (SED) smokers. SED smokers are harder to engage in interventions. Thus, Adapt2Quit’s increased engagement will be of particular importance for targeting SED smokers. In addition to the potential impact of the Adapt2Quit messages in inducing and engaging smokers in cessation, our goal is to increase use of the state Quitline. We will recruit 700 SED smokers at two sites. All smokers will complete a baseline interview and receive a paper brochure with information about the state’s Quitline. Smokers will then be randomized to: Adapt2Quit or the standard messaging. As the system is designed to enhance engagement, and through engagement lead to positive actions, Aim 1 will focus on engagement [Hypothesis (H1a) Among Adapt2Quit smokers, those with higher engagement levels (completed more ratings) will have greater scores on the perceived competence scale (PCS)]. Aim 2 compares (Adapt2Quit and control) behavior change processes including perceived competence for smoking cessation and cessation supporting actions (calling a Quitline) [H2a: Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater scores on the PCS than control smokers; H2b: Adapt2Quit smokers will adopt more cessation supporting actions (Quitline, NRT) than control smokers]. Aim 3 will assess effectiveness of the system [H3a: (primary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater smoking cessation rates (6-month point prevalence biochemically verified) than control smokers; H3b: (secondary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have lower time to first quit attempt than control smokers; H3c: (mediation analysis) Measured internal and external processes will mediate the effect of Adapt2Quit on smoking cessation]. To accomplish the above aims, we have brought together a multidisciplinary team with relevant expertise, and a strong track record of collaboration. 8. Narrative We propose testing Adapt2Quit — an innovative motivational texting “recommender system.” Adapt2Quit enhances tailored motivational messaging systems using machine-learning algorithms to learn from, and adapt to, user feedback (prior and daily message ratings), thereby increasing message personal relevance. Our study will test Adapt2Quit motivational messaging texting with socioeconomically disadvantaged (SED) smokers.","Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers”",10146309,R01CA240551,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biochemical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Motivation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Self Determination', 'Self Efficacy', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking and Health Research', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'active control', 'base', 'behavior change', 'design', 'digital health', 'disadvantaged population', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning progression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine replacement', 'primary outcome', 'quitline', 'recruit', 'rural healthcare', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking-related disease', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,644137
"Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) Cigarette smoking accounts for 480,000 premature deaths and one third of all cancer deaths annually in the US. There is enormous need for high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking cessation. For the past 15 years, mobile phone-delivered text messaging interventions such as the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT have been a prominent technology addressing this need. However, very much like all widely available technologies for smoking cessation (e.g., websites), text messaging interventions have modest quit rates, driven largely by low engagement. Fortunately, a new technology provides a therapeutic conversation to address the problem of engagement that impacts text messaging and other current digital technologies for smoking cessation. Advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are now making it possible to create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through conversations. CAs are supportive, empathic, reflectively listen, provide personalized responses, and offer goal setting and advice appropriately timed to the needs of the user. Regarding CAs for smoking cessation, the major knowledge gaps are: (1) their efficacy, (2) theoretical mechanisms, and (3) the cost-effectiveness. Also unexplored are the potential baseline moderators of CAs for smoking cessation. We recently developed a CA for smoking cessation, called “QuitBot,” evaluated it in a diary study, and then tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 306), comparing it with the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT. The pilot RCT design was very feasible with 93% three-month follow-up. QuitBot had: (a) high participant engagement and (b) high quit rates at the three-month follow-up—very promising in comparison with SmokefreeTXT. Addressing these knowledge gaps and building on the promising results of our QuitBot research, the project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of QuitBot (n = 760) versus SmokefreeTXT (n = 760) with 12-month follow-up in order to determine whether QuitBot: (1) provides higher quit rates than SmokefreeTXT, (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by therapeutic alliance processes and engagement, and (3) is cost-effective vs. SmokefreeTXT. In addition, this study will explore whether these baseline factors moderate the effectiveness of QuitBot: trust, social support, and demographics (e.g., sex). This innovative project will advance the fields of research on CAs both for smoking cessation in particular and for health behavior change in general— regardless of whether the results are positive or null. Positive results could have high population-level impact and stimulate new lines of research into CA dissemination and implementation, and the adaptation of CAs for multiple subpopulations of smokers, languages, and community and medical settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The overall aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness of a conversational agent for smoking cessation.

"Using natural language processing to determine predictors of healthy diet and physical activity behavior change in ovarian cancer survivors ABSTRACT Cancer survivors are a growing population in the United States; more than 16 million currently live in the US and by 2030 this number is expected to exceed 22 million. It is estimated that more than 50 percent of new cancer cases could be eliminated through a combination of healthy behaviors (e.g., physical activity and healthy diet); and cancer survivors are at high risk for developing new and recurrent cancer. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of cancer survivors are not attaining the cancer preventive guidelines of healthy diet and physical activity. In the past few decades, a variety of telephone-based lifestyle interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in helping survivors meet cancer preventive guidelines, however these trials are labor intensive and expensive to deliver, limiting their potential for broad dissemination. We propose to address this hurdle by taking advantage of recent advances in artificial intelligence to reduce the cost and maximize the impact of these much-needed interventions. Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are analytical techniques that automatically learn from direct and indirect patterns in data. We propose to use machine learned algorithms to analyze speech to aid in predicting who may be at risk of poor adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors. These speech data will come from the Lifestyle Intervention for Ovarian cancer Enhanced Survival (LIVES) study, a telephone-based lifestyle intervention testing whether a diet low in fat and high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber, coupled with increased physical activity will increase time to disease progression in 1200 ovarian cancer survivors who have recently completed treatment, as compared to an attention control. Intervention coaches employed motivational interviewing to elicit behavior change and all calls on the LIVES trial were recorded with repeat assessments of diet, physical activity, patient reported and clinical outcomes. We will use this existing and robust longitudinal data set, which pairs conversational speech data with explicit outcomes, to achieve the following objectives. 1) Develop a ML model to identify patterns in the interactions between coaches and their participants that signal a likelihood of optimal behavior change in diet and physical activity given the comprehensive LIVES data set, utilizing voice recorded calls, demographics, and clinical and patient reported outcomes collected at multiple time points. 2) Decompose the ML model in terms of “intervenable factors”, so that participant affect, coach adherence to the intervention protocol, and other important aspects of the interaction can be individually evaluated for their role in predicting behavior change, as well as adherence to intervention goals. This decomposition will directly enable early and targeted adjustments to intervention plans for individuals, reducing the cost and increasing the efficacy of intervention strategies. ML and NLP methods can produce models that listen to a coaching conversation and automatically predict whether it will result in positive change towards enactment of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Such predictive models would enable more efficient, effective, and individualized lifestyle interventions, the first step towards personalized behavioral medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study examines whether artificial intelligence can use speech and audio from health coaching calls to predict who is most likely to enact healthy lifestyle behaviors of diet and physical activity. This project uses previously collected data from the Lifestyle Intervention for Ovarian Cancer Enhanced Survival (LIVES) Study to 1) Develop a machine learning model to identify patterns in the interactions between coaches and their participants that signal a likelihood of optimal behavior change of healthy lifestyle and 2) Decompose the machine learning model in terms of “intervenable factors”, so that participant affect, coach adherence to fidelity protocols, and other important aspects of the interaction can be individually evaluated for their role in predicting healthy lifestyle behavior change and adherence to intervention goals.",Using natural language processing to determine predictors of healthy diet and physical activity behavior change in ovarian cancer survivors,10109452,R21CA256680,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Fruit', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health education', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrent Malignant Neoplasm', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trial of Labor', 'United States', 'Vegetables', 'Voice', 'anticancer research', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral adherence', 'behavioral outcome', 'cancer therapy', 'cost', 'demographics', 'experience', 'good diet', 'healthy lifestyle', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle data', 'lifestyle intervention', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'telephone coaching']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2021,209312
"Development and Pilot Testing of a Just in Time Mobile Smoking Cessation Intervention for Persons living with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY This application, in direct response to PAR-19-309, will systematically develop and pilot test the Sense2Quit App to improve tobacco cessation in persons living with HIV (PLWH). The prevalence of cigarette smoking among PLWH is more than three times that of the general adult United States (U.S.) population. The high prevalence of cigarette smoking and the high incidence of tobacco-related cancer and other smoking-related diseases among PLWH calls for swift action to intervene to reduce tobacco use rates. However, evidence to guide tobacco cessation in PLWH is inadequate. To address this need, our team proposes to develop, and pilot test the Sense2Quit App, a multi-component smartphone app which provides just-in-time feedback; specifically addresses challenges to tobacco cessation for PLWH: slips, relapses, and difficulties associated with neurocognitive deficits; supports both self-efficacy and decisional balance; and provides quit plan reminders. The artificial intelligence algorithm (validated by our study team) interprets data from a smartwatch to detect smoking hand motions – a technology with more than 98% accuracy in differentiating “lighting up” from other similar motions. The Sense2Quit App leverages smartwatch data and detects when and where smoking activity occurs so that a message can be sent in real time to the participant to help them manage the slip (a puff or two) from becoming a relapse. This just-in-time feedback is critical especially in the first few weeks of a quit attempt. Additionally, Global Positioning System data can help participants avoid triggers (coffee shops, smoking relatives, or friends' homes, etc.). Finally, the Sense2Quit App provides information on how well smokers are progressing through their quit plan, support tips, and motivational tools (i.e., badges related to saving money from not purchasing cigarettes). The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Explore and identify, using qualitative methods, acceptable and appropriate app content and features of the Sense2Quit App to support smoking cessation and relapse prevention in PLWH who smoke; 2) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the Sense2Quit App in a sample of 60 PLWH who smoke; and 3) Employ the RE-AIM framework to assess the potential scale-up of the Sense2Quit App. As part of the pilot trial, we will randomize 60 HIV-positive smokers to the Sense2Quit App, standard smoking cessation counseling, and nicotine replacement therapy (active condition) versus standard smoking cessation counseling plus nicotine replacement therapy (control) and examine group differences in rate of quit attempts, 7-day point prevalence abstinence, and sustained abstinence. We will calculate an effect size estimate of the Sense2Quit App to guide, in part, the sample size needed for a larger scale clinical trial. The knowledge gained from the proposed research will enable the scientific community and patients to improve tobacco cessation in those persons who are in most need in the U.S. Given our team's unique and complementary expertise in each of the areas necessary to develop an innovative smoking cessation intervention to improve outcomes among PLWH, we are confident that the findings from this study will be easily scaled-up for further testing to ensure improvement in health outcomes for PLWH. PROJECT NARRATIVE The prevalence of smoking in the general United States population has gradually declined to the lowest rate ever recorded; however, this has not been true for persons living with HIV (PLWH). Therefore, our study team seeks to develop and pilot test Sense2Quit, a tobacco cessation intervention for PLWH. The knowledge gained from this research will enable the scientific community, clinicians, and community stakeholders to improve tobacco cessation outcomes for PLWH.",Development and Pilot Testing of a Just in Time Mobile Smoking Cessation Intervention for Persons living with HIV,10335352,R21CA265961,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior assessment', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coffee', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'Gestures', 'Global Positioning System', 'HIV', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'High Prevalence', 'Home', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Software Engineering', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco use', 'Tobacco-Related Carcinoma', 'United States', 'Viral Load result', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'craving', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'former smoker', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'multi-component intervention', 'nicotine replacement', 'pilot trial', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduce tobacco use', 'response', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking prevalence', 'smoking relapse', 'smoking-related disease', 'success', 'tobacco cessation intervention', 'tool', 'usability', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,215044
"SBIR TOPIC 425 PHASE I:  POSTURE ANALYSIS THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING (PATHML) Advances in wearable technology and the availability of low-cost video have tremendous potential to provide new insight into how physical behavior is associated with health, define clinical trial outcomes and assess functional status and activities of daily living patients within their home or a rehabilitation setting. (1-4) Cameras and/or videos can record continuously in a passive and unobtrusive manner, enabling participants to provide a detailed record of daily activity that has applications in health research, memory retention and ethnography. (5-11) However, in health research the use of image processing remains burdensome and cost prohibitive, often requiring manual annotations by trained staff. To automate annotation of images and video in recent years scientists have been using emerging machine learning technology applied to computer vision. With the help of multi-layered special purpose neural networks (Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks) researchers have been able to accurately classify still images and video frames based on what is depicted in them, recognize the position of objects of interest in an image, recognize humans in an image, and track objects (vehicles, humans) across multiple consecutive frames of a video. (12-18) To date, this technology has been applied to commercial products and sport performance, but not to quantify levels of physical activity, performance or behavior for health research. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software program that can accurately classify physical activities (e.g. ’walking’, ‘sitting’ or ‘standing up”), information about behavior (e.g., location and purpose of the activity), and performance (e.g., walking speed and sit to stand transition times). n/a",SBIR TOPIC 425 PHASE I:  POSTURE ANALYSIS THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING (PATHML),10498198,5N91021C00040,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Architecture', 'Automated Annotation', 'Behavior', 'Categories', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Ethnography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Home', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'functional status', 'human imaging', 'image processing', 'insight', 'interest', 'memory retention', 'neural network', 'open source', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'walking speed', 'wearable device']",NCI,"SENTIMETRIX, INC.",N43,2021,399907
