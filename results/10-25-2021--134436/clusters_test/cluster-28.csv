"A proprietary single-cell analytics platform for accelerating biologics manufacturing Project Summary:  OneCyte Biotechnologies, Inc. is a spin-out from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) advancing next-generation single-cell technologies to impact drug development and bio-manufacturing. OneCyte is a pioneer of single-cell proteomics and is developing a platform technology that cuts many months off biologic (e.g. therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) or vaccines) drug development. A key challenge in biopharma are slow bio-manufacturing timelines. The world is currently experiencing the impact of slow development timelines on human health and the economy in the extreme example of the COVID-19 pandemic and its burden of rapidly developing and manufacturing billions of doses of novel vaccines and MAbs. This is highlighting the need for accelerated drug development and manufacturing.  OneCyte’s single-cell platform technology provides insight into cell biology at an unprecedented scale; potentially enabling new classes of therapeutics, and enhancing basic scientific understandings. The impact of this technology will be reducing time and cost of pharmaceutical development, as well as improving efficacy and safety. This can enable developing new drugs for currently untreatable and rare diseases, which are presently not feasible to develop or manufacture. Beyond this initial application, OneCyte’s technology could become a readily implemented research tool, enhancing the basic understanding of biology, or facilitating engineering of cell function for cell therapy applications.  OneCyte is seeking funding to expand the innovative single-cell analytical capabilities and screen for additional critical product quality attributes (PQAs) important for drug safety and efficacy, as well as transition the single-cell technology platform to a commercial process by the end of SBIR Phase II.  In Aim 1. OneCyte will develop and implement innovative single-cell assays for additional PQAs, focusing on screening for undesired deviations in drug manufacturability, which lead to reduced drug circulating half-life and reduced production yield.  In Aim 2. OneCyte will automate and scale-up single-cell data analytics towards improved predictivity for drug manufacturability, as well as automate the pipeline for commercial data analytics with the necessary minimum user input.  In Aim 3. OneCyte will develop a manufacturing ready thermoplastic microfluidic chip, replacing an elastomeric material. Validation of the new plastic chips for use in the single-cell process will be performed by testing cell performance compared to elastomeric chips. Project Narrative: The cell line development process is a critical bottleneck in biologics manufacturing as it is time consuming and labor intensive. OneCyte’s goal is to translate its proprietary high throughput single-cell proteomics platform to revolutionize cell line development by significantly reducing the time and effort for cell line selection. Accelerating biologics manufacturing will have direct impact on patient access to novel therapeutics.",A proprietary single-cell analytics platform for accelerating biologics manufacturing,10324104,R44TR003747,"['Address', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Biomanufacturing', 'Bioreactors', 'Biotechnology', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell secretion', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dyes', 'Elastomers', 'Engineering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Half-Life', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Lectin', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nanoarray Analytical Device', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Sterility', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Translating', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cloud platform', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data infrastructure', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'elastomeric', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'glycosylation', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'manufacturability', 'medication safety', 'nanolitre', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'novel vaccines', 'operation', 'phase 1 study', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'scale up', 'screening', 'single cell technology', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'vaccine-induced antibodies']",NCATS,"ONECYTE BIOTECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2021,855264
"Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 presents a public health emergency: There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non- invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan The plan will be developed under the direction of Sr/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell & Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate. PROJECT NARRATIVE This program addresses the critical unmet need of an effective means to screen for COVID-19 infection, and potentially other novel virus infections, in a community setting based upon the body odor signature of the disease. The program will result in a validated prototype system, with a test time of minutes, a test cost of approximately $0.50, on a path to rapid FDA approval.","Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array",10266403,U18TR003775,"['Address', 'Age', 'Astronomy', 'Benchmarking', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 screening', 'COVID-19 testing', 'Carbon Nanotubes', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Housekeeping', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Sciences', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Lawyers', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Occupations', 'Odors', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Production', 'RADx', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Workplace', 'animal care', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'community setting', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high standard', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'nano', 'nanosensors', 'next generation', 'novel virus', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health emergency', 'racial diversity', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sensor', 'sex', 'software development', 'software systems', 'vapor', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U18,2021,999830
"Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensing device that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automated data processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use with the aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOC biomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally. Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaled breath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC- MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPI Dr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven track record to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysis device using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-based gas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperatures and pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip- based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and will compare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip from Deviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, and under direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of research engineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guide development of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands of clinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device and return to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS data generated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towards the end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scale production and deployment of the device for clinical approval. These efforts are supported by collaborator Dr. Nam Tran, Director of Clinical Pathology & Clinical Chemistry at the UC Davis Medical Center. Project Narrative: In the United States and worldwide, public health experts agree that nations must increase their capacity to test for COVID-19, yet global supplies for testing materials remain scarce. This project would lead to the development of an entirely new type of COVID-19 test, one that could diagnose infections with only a breath sample. Through this proposal, our team would develop a portable device that could identify people with COVID-19 infections by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in exhaled breath.",Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics,10266337,U18TR003795,"['2019-nCoV', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 test', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhalation', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Flushing', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heating', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Materials Testing', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Observational Study', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Spectrometry', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Respiratory Infections', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'clinical care', 'detector', 'deviant', 'differential expression', 'disease transmission', 'graphical user interface', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'ion mobility', 'large scale production', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pandemic disease', 'portability', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U18,2021,975463
"COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device Recent studies, including ours, have suggested that breath may allow us to diagnose COVID-19 infection and even monitor its progress. As compared to immunological and genetic based methods using sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the proposed SCENT project are: (1) to refine automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analysis on up to 760 patients, and identify and validate the COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), we will complete the following specific aims. (1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. We will construct 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that require only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices will be upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, we will optimize and automate our existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device can automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c). (2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and negative patients. We will recruit a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine – Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital – Detroit). We will conduct breath analysis using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status. (3) Validate the COVID-19 biomarkers using our refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, we will recruit a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2.  We will leverage existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit our milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, we will have a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that can detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings. Narrative  Our team of engineers, clinicians, and data scientists has developed a portable, high performance breath analyzer that can be used to detect certain diseases. In this project, we will adapt and refine our existing device and algorithms so they can be used for rapid, safe, and non- invasive COVID-19 detection. People will simply breath into the device and it will quickly provide results, meaning that it can be used in a variety of everyday settings to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device,10266206,U18TR003812,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 detection', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 monitoring', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 prognosis', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Process', 'Production', 'RADx Radical', 'Research', 'Resources', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'acute hypoxemic respiratory failure', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'fight against', 'fighting', 'global health', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'nasopharyngeal swab', 'pandemic disease', 'point of care', 'portability', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'screening', 'severe COVID-19', 'two-dimensional']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U18,2021,999775
"Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs). Project Summary The technological transformation of US health care with the explosion of new devices and iterative changes mandates the acquisition of real-world evidence (RWE) to study devices and technologies pragmatically. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded the RWE framework development in the pursuit of sufficient evidence that is required for regulatory decision-making such as device approvals and surveillance. With regulatory support since the launch of the National Medical Device Registry Task Force in 2015, the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet) created 15 national and international coordinated registry networks (CRNs), which develop or link well-curated national RWE sources such as registries, administrative, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. The MDEpiNet is a key partner of the National Evaluation System of Technologies (NEST) coordinating center and is an international public-private partnership focusing on building global infrastructure and methodologies to advance the use of RWE for medical device evaluation. CRNs not only focus on prevention of harms but also the promotion of safer device innovation through the development of study designs that expedites patient recruitment at lower costs than traditional clinical research. MDEpiNet developed a maturity model for CRNs with various levels of achievements in seven key domains: 1) device identification, 2) quality improvement, 3) total product life-cycle, 4) data quality, 5) efficiency, 6) governance and sustainability, 7) patient engagement. This proposal focuses on the creation of innovative tools and methods necessary to achieve maturation of the networks through efficient curation of robust RWE. We will capitalize on established partnerships with registries, professional societies, integrated health systems, and many academic institutions to advance this critical national infrastructure as a foundational component of NEST. We will facilitate advancements of RWE through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and continued innovative methods development to link registries with Medicare, commercial, statewide, and EHR data to enable better research and surveillance for devices. Our specific aims facilitate stakeholder engagement for device-specific core minimum data development in women's health, prostate cancer, orthopedics, vascular disease, robot-assisted surgery, and temporomandibular joints. We will also advance and enrich linked data capacities in vascular disease, hernia repair, breast implant, prostate cancer, Women's Health, and gastrointestinal cancer CRNs. Finally, we conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities in device outcomes and use machine learning and active surveillance methods in hernia repair, orthopedics, stroke treatment, vascular disease, and Women's health CRNs. The CRN community of practice will enable centralized knowledge sharing to support cross-specialty and technology learning and applications. Through this, we advance the CRNs using innovative, scalable, and dynamic approaches and help them become foundational components of NEST. Narrative Medical Device Epidemiology Network will advance the research and surveillance capabilities of coordinated registry networks through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and linkages of real-world data sources. We will also conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities, use machine learning for risk predictions, and implement active surveillance for devices and technologies.",Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs).,10209943,U01FD006936,[' '],FDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,U01,2021,230000
"Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award. Narrative We will refine the operations of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford in coordination with other Phase II sites of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network to diagnose the undiagnosed and facilitate a transition to sustainability. Our Center will bring Stanford’s long history in technology development, genomic data analysis, stem cell biology, and translational science to the team-based diagnosis and care of patients with undiagnosed disease. We will refine existing procedures to further optimize the diagnostic process and integrate care of the undiagnosed into clinical practice while preserving the scientific mission of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network.",Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford,10210276,U01HG010218,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Award', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Child Health', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Education', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Silencing', 'Generations', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Organoids', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policy Maker', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high-throughput drug screening', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'operation', 'outreach', 'patient outreach', 'phenotypic data', 'preservation', 'programs', 'reference genome', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'socioeconomics', 'stem cell biology', 'success', 'support network', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'variant detection', 'virtual screening']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,1100000
"Portable Hearing Laboratory  - CRP In the parent Phase II project (R44DC016247; PI: C. Pavlovic) we successfully developed a portable platform for developing and testing new hearing aid technology. This Portable Hearing Laboratory, or PHL, has now been acquired and is being used by a number of leading university laboratories and other research centers and their feedback has been extremely positive. The device features a central unit (BatAndCat Box) which provides an appropriate and complete hearing aid ambient for developing new algorithms. A number of realistic interfaces has also been provided. This includes an extremely high quality BTE system we designed; an ITE system adapted by us, as well as an appropriate interface circuitry for typical wearables (e.g; headsets via the line input). Finally, a smart phone app features interfaces both for the researcher and the subject. The system runs the Master Hearing aid sweet developed concurrently in R01DC015429 (PIs Hohmann and Pavlovic). In this CRP renewal we will achieve the following goals: 1. Implement various Design for Excellence Measures (DFX) and super modern manufacturing  technology to obtain the highest product quality at the lowest product cost. This would make  the product affordable for large clinical studies and, potentially, for some consumer sales. 2. In response to the recent availability of, and the recent research demand for, a far greater  processing power to enable the development of algorithms which rely on machine learning,  we plan to increase the processing power of the device by at least 10 times, and likely 20  times, by changing the processor core to a multicore system. 3. Introduce modern low-latency BLE technology to enable efﬁcient noise reduction by utilizing  remote microphones and machine learning. 4. The other complementary requirement to extract speech from noise is being able to inform  the system whom the listener is actually listening to. This will be achieved by providing on  the PHL the interface means for external multi-sensor arrays such as EEG, OEG, etc. 5. Execute electrical and mechanical design changes dramatically reducing the size and  weight of the device. This would not only be a much more acceptable device for long clinical  trials, but would also open up a direct-to-consumer, secondary market for the device. 6. It is our strong determination to provide continuous support to the Beta sites for extensive  further testing of the device in a variety of settings. We consider this the best means to  reach the perfection. Portable Hearing Laboratory (PHL), developed in R44DC016247 has been deployed successfully at various research centers and it features a central unit connected to a number of realistic interfaces such as BTEs, ITEs, or typical wearables. In this CRP renewal we upgrade the technology to support demanding machine learning algorithms interfaced almost inconspicuously to a number of EEG and EOG electrodes to extract perfectly speech from noise.

Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,10075985,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2021,100000
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world’s population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning (ML) and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of the parent project is to improve human health and positively impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this supplement project is to extend the design of our ‘clinician-in-the-loop’ smart home to include computational methods for recognizing and reporting on bias in ML algorithms. Bias in ML algorithms is a public health hazard. A secondary objective is to add to the scarce body of knowledge regarding ML techniques for assessing and quantifying algorithm bias. In this supplement study, we will demonstrate how to operationalize bioethics principles such as autonomy (the right to make informed decisions about care and right to be informed about any associated risks) into actionable design requirements to close the gap between principles and practice. We will then share these with the ML healthcare application (ML- HCA) research community by creating a new open source online course containing 3 modules. This supplement proposal builds upon our extensive experience in the CASAS lab at Washington State University and prior collaboration on the development of smart home design, activity recognition, and the use of these technologies for functional health monitoring, assessment, and intervention. This supplement effort will allow us to expand our sample size and enhance the robustness of pervasive-computing-based behavior monitoring and machine learning to further advance the quality of health monitoring, including bias recognition. We will offer new advances in computational methods for anti-bias algorithm development using data from smart homes and smart watches that are monitoring the daily activities of underrepresented persons. Our course modules will support knowledge development regarding how to operationalize bioethics principles for practice at each stage of ML-HCA design. In the online course we will also address the importance and impact of multidisciplinary teams in designing for transparency, fairness, and non-discriminatory ML-HCA applications such as the health smart home. Given that ML models are known to introduce bias and risk to members of minority groups and given our national conversation on equity, fundamental human rights, and the risks associated with living as a minority person, it is critical that health technology-human interface with underrepresented persons is improved. Anti-bias ML training techniques that could be broadly applied in the development of ML-HCAs would be of significant value to minority individuals and families and all of society. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposed supplement builds on the parent “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home study that automatically identifies health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. In this supplement, we will use smart home and wearable data from minority persons for developing clinician-guided novel computational methods to train our ML models to recognize and report on bias of sensitive demographic features (e.g., race, low SES) to mitigate the negative impacts of bias on informed consenting and autonomous decision-making regarding health monitoring that uses an intelligent agent. This research is relevant to public health because technologies that do not perpetuate bias would be of significant value to minority individuals and families and to all of society.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,10367017,R01NR016732,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Bioethics', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Hazards', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Home', 'Human', 'Human Rights', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sample Size', 'Self Determination', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Washington', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain health', 'cognitive change', 'cost', 'course module', 'design', 'experience', 'health assessment', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'intelligent agent', 'intervention effect', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mindfulness', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'online course', 'open source', 'parent project', 'physical conditioning', 'sensor', 'smart home', 'smart watch', 'tool']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,144139
"Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases. PROJECT SUMMARY Care delivery at primary and urgent clinics is critically hindered by doctor shortage, time constraints and the inappropriate use of infrastructures. The rising aging population and unhealthy lifestyle are expected to drive the increase of chronic disease and the national health expenditures associated (20% of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025). Telemedicine has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce the cost of access to care minimizing the dependence of patients on health professionals. However, current solutions that connect patients with doctors don’t allow accurate diagnosis due to the lack or inappropriate use of medical devices. AdviNOW proposes to implement computer vision to offer a clinically reliable approach to perform self- evaluation of vital parameters. AdviNOW is developing the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms to guide any non-trained people to correct usage of Class 2 medical devices at the point of need. The new approach will represent the core component of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) which will be integrated into telemedicine platforms, kiosks or any medical office to automate medical visits, improving the management of chronic diseases. In Phase I, we validated the feasibility of our product by developing a module for heart stethoscope exams. Users were able to autonomously take a phonocardiogram measurement in <8 seconds, while the system verified the correct use of the device. In this Phase II project, the additional modules required for a minimum viable product (MVP) with significant clinical and commercial impact will be developed. This will include modules for Respiratory Auscultation, Otoscopic Ear Examination, Mouth Examination, and temperature control. The developed modules will be then integrated within the current front-end structure. The MVP will be validated in a clinical setting, where its usability, benefits, and clinical effectiveness will be assessed. Additionally, the platform will be integrated with major providers of Electronic Health Records. At the end of this SBIR Phase II project, an MVP ready to enter the market will have been fully developed. Future R&D efforts of AdviNOW Medical will be aimed at the development of Artificial Intelligence based diagnosis of abnormal medical conditions from self-measured biometric parameters. The mission of AdviNOW Medical is to develop a disruptive solution for the delivery of healthcare that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, and available in centralized and decentralized locations. By reducing the time for routine analysis, the actual doctor-patient encounter will be more meaningful, improving the clinical outcome as well as patient satisfaction. This invention promises to disrupt healthcare, as providers will improve cost management and profitability by visiting more patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE New strategies for accurate and efficient delivery of healthcare to chronic disease patients are required. This project will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms which will guide patients to use Class II medical devices for self-assessment of vital parameters to monitor the health status of chronic conditions.

"Improving the accessibility and relevance of Medical Nutritional Therapy among people with Type 2 diabetes in the Latino community through a customizable, AI-powered application. PROJECT SUMMARY Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) is an effective treatment for managing Type 2 diabetes (T2D), but studies have shown that few T2D patients adhere to or access it. This low utilization rate can be attributed to the small number of registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) compared to the number of patients with T2D, limited reimbursement pathways for MNT, and resource constraints in the patient population. These issues are exacerbated in the Latino community due to limited access to care, economic disparities, and few resources tailored to culture identity. Currently, incorporating cultural relevance into an MNT plan must be done manually by an RDN. Existing digital applications focus on meal tracking or discrete biological factors (e.g. gut microbiome), supplementing healthy lifestyles rather than supporting MNT delivery and failing to address personal and cultural factors in meal plan creation and adherence. YumAI is a novel AI-based application that delivers and tracks adherence to MNT-compliant recipes that are customized to factors such as budget, family, location, season, food preferences, and preparation complexity. By automating meal plan adjustment, YumAI brings customized, high-quality MNT directly to patients through an easy-to-use digital application available on desktop computers and personal devices. In this Phase I SBIR project, we will further develop this AI-powered application, incorporating feedback from preliminary testing, ensuring compliance with ADA dietary guidelines and MNT stipulations, and optimizing the software specifically for individuals with T2D of Mexican decent. We will conduct two design thinking workshops to identify product features and discover factors in recipe customization and MNT compliance. Through an iterative design process, we will develop a proof of concept of YumAI and demonstrate algorithmic capabilities that enable basic recipe plan customization. Our two-step approach balances compliance with MNT standards and builds in relevant factors to customize recipe recommendations to user needs. Recognizing the complexity of plan customization and the number of possible dimensions of adherence, the purpose of the research is to demonstrate technical feasibility of a solution that can be enhanced in future development and to identify gaps in data collection. Successful completion of this project will result in a functional prototype of YumAI, the first digital health mechanism for increasing access to MNT for the Mexican population with T2D. This project will provide proof of concept and feasibility for future studies to scale YumAI for a broader population. It will prepare us for a Phase II project that explores in situ interaction with the product and efficacy of the product in solving issues of and patient adherence, cultural awareness, and RDN scalability. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT), a holistic component of a Type 2 diabetes (T2D) management plan provided by a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN), is shown to improve HbA1c, delay complications of T2D, and lead to significant cost savings compared to other T2D WUeaWPeQW PeWhRdV.

"Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring Abstract Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). Both hypotension and hypertension can impair the function of vital organs (e.g. brain, heart and kidneys), and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative mortality, which makes it important to detect BP changes as quickly as possible to prompt timely intervention or therapy. However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, an invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection. In the United States, about 80,000 blood stream infections caused by an arterial catheter are reported annually. Due to the inherent risks associated with a-line, it is used only for clinically indicated high risk surgeries or ICU patients. As a result of the a-line risks and discomforts, even though more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, only a small portion receive continuous BP monitoring. In addition, although vital sign (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP etc) monitoring is routine in surgical rooms and ICUs, currently most monitoring devices are fixed in individual rooms, which result in gaps in patient monitoring, accidents during patient transport process, and extra work to disconnect and reconnect sensors when leaving and entering a new facility. Seamless “continuum of care” monitoring—for instance from surgical room to ICUs, including transport in between and without reconnecting sensors—is on top of the wish list by clinician. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop portable ECG monitors and “mobile ICUs”; however so far, no continuous and seamless BP monitoring has been achieved. This proposal fully leverages the outcomes from the related R21 (EB022271) project. We will develop novel machine learning and deep learning based data fusion algorithms to use existing vital signs for continuous BP monitoring, then integrate them with our unique wearable patient monitoring system to form a novel perioperative patient monitoring system. We will test the system’s performance against gold standard a- line and Finapres BP technologies. to develop a fully functional technology for noninvasive, continuous, and seamless BP monitoring. We will also develop a public database for future BP technology development. The proposed multimodality algorithms, seamless BP monitoring system and PhysioNet database will provide major steps forward to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring. Project Narrative Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, the invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection, and current noninvasive BP technologies have poor stability.

"BGscope: a non-invasive, continuous, and accurate O2 AND CO2 sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Blood gases are the primary indicators of effectiveness of ventilation, circulation and perfusion in neonates. Every year ~ 4 million babies are born in the United States. Of these, 15% (~500,000) suffer from respiratory distress mainly due to prematurity and/or low birth weight. These babies are transferred to the neonatology intensive care unit (NICU) immediately after birth, for whom approximately 10 million blood gas tests are performed annually. The gold standard of measuring blood gases are invasive procedures where blood is drawn through arterial lines connected to the umbilical cord, through needle pokes of the heel (known as heel stick) for capillary blood or through a venous line. While arterial sampling provides the highest accuracy, it is not easy to perform and poses a high risk of infection; capillary sampling is the most frequently performed procedure, with the consequences of being painful and a high chance of sample clotting; venous sampling is very easy to perform with the least accuracy among all the previous methods. Therefore, non-invasive, continuous monitoring devices are essential to avoid the adverse effects of the blood gas test. Oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), are the most important respiratory gases, and their partial pressures (PO2 and PCO2) and oxygen saturation (SO2) collectively reflect the overall adequacy of respiratory function. Conventional O2 sensors (popularly known as pulse oximeters) are based on optical spectrophotometry technology and are relatively large to be placed on the limb of the premature/ preterm neonate and consequently lose signal integrity. CO2 sensors (popularly known as transcutaneous CO2) detect the dissolved CO2 gas in blood through skin by depositing heat onto a localized capillary bed. In both cases, the blood gas measurement is at the capillary level and is unable to provide the accuracy of the gold standard. In addition, these sensors are capable of only measuring one of two blood gases. Moreover, continuous operation of these sensors generates heat and may damage the sensitive skin of neonates. Therefore, frequent repositioning of the sensor is required, and further blood draws are necessary for the sensor recalibration. Our product non-invasively measures arterial blood gas; partial pressures of O2 and CO2 (PO2 and PCO2) and SO2. It is a simple wristband that can be used at the wrist or ankle. It does not generate heat or damage sensitive tissue. It continuously measures arterial blood gases (O2 and CO2) with high accuracy. Our proposed device will help reducing the blood draws from NICU babies by ~75%. We have named it BGScope for Blood Gas Scope. BGScope works based on the principles of multispectral photoacoustic imaging. Our short-term goals are: (i) to develop the BGScope device and a computational kernel to non-invasively measure arterial blood gases including, partial pressures of O2 and CO2 and oxygen saturation (SO2); and (ii) to conduct a pilot study to evaluate the BGScope on rabbits.

"Supplemental transmission aided attenuation correction for high performance quantitative PET imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative tracer images from combined PET-CT and PET-MR are increasingly being utilized for radiological decision-making and clinical trials. CT and MR based data corrections for PET photon attenuation, typically the largest impact on tracer quantification, can lead to increased radiation dose to the subject or require lengthy additional dedicated MR scans, respectively. Artificial intelligence algorithms that use the PET signal originating from the subject alone to estimate attenuation have shown promising early results, but, can have reduced performance when applied to exams different from the training data. Reconstruction methods that jointly estimate both the measured attenuation and tracer contrast from the subject PET signal represent a viable alternative, but, to date, have failed to match the quantification of CT approaches. Consequently, no single approach for PET attenuation correction that consistently produces high quantification and does not compromise patient safety or throughput currently exists. This is an important problem, since research and clinical findings must balance these practical issues with data quality. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and characterize a high performance attenuation correction scheme that utilizes both the PET signal from the subject and a variable activity external source. The central hypothesis is that the proposed reconstruction method will have significantly improved performance over reconstruction algorithms using PET signal originating from the subject alone, independent of the imaging study. The two specific aims include: 1) developing and validating a supplemental transmission-based algorithm for correcting PET images for photon attenuation during commercial PET imaging and 2) prototyping and characterizing a device capable of dynamically varying external source activity. The result of Aim 1 will be a reconstruction algorithm that is optimized to produce quantitative PET data for some of the most common clinical PET studies. Under Aim 2, a prototype device that can repeatability vary the external source activity in order to maximize tracer quantification while minimizing the unavoidable degradation to patient tracer image noise, caused by the introduction of any external source, will be produced. The innovation is an attenuation correction strategy that greatly mitigates the limitations of previous joint reconstruction methods to deliver quantitative PET diagnostics that are expected to match those of silver standard CT approaches. This is significant because the number of patients receiving brain and cardiac PET-CT scans, exams the proposed method is expected to benefit, is steadily increasing. For PET-MR, the method may improve tracer quantification where MR has limited performance and increase patient throughput by eliminating the need for non-diagnostic attenuation-only MR acquisitions. Thus, the proposed strategy has great potential to significantly improve radiological decision- making and clinical trial findings that rely on quantitative PET uptake measurements. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to the public health because the development of a PET radiotracer attenuation correction strategy that is independent of the exam type, has the potential to improve the strength of research and clinical findings based on quantitative PET measurements. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIBIB's mission that pertains to enhancing existing imaging and bioengineering modalities.",Supplemental transmission aided attenuation correction for high performance quantitative PET imaging,10222671,R03EB028946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Noise', 'Oncology', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Scattering', 'Radioactive', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Source', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Tube', 'attenuation', 'base', 'data quality', 'experimental study', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'patient safety', 'pediatric patients', 'prototype', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'transmission process', 'uptake']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2021,86474
"Towards a Convenient, Point-of-Care Device for Screening and Surveillance of Aortic Aneurysms PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT An aortic aneurysm carries increasing risk of rupture with growing aneurysm diameter. This condition is typically asymptomatic, so screening and surveillance are essential. Ultrasound and other imaging methods are employed for such monitoring at high accuracy. However, these methods require an expert-operator and are expensive, and aortic aneurysms are considerably underdetected at present and may become even more underdetected in the future as the disease prevalence increases with societal aging. The broad goal is to establish a point-of-care device that is convenient in use and cost (e.g., in a smartphone form factor) for aortic aneurysm screening and surveillance. The underlying hypothesis is that arterial waveforms, which can be obtained with such a device, constitute a non- imaging solution for indicating aneurysm size. This new hypothesis will be efficiently and effectively tested by leveraging a wealth of existing patient data. These data include high-fidelity, non-invasive waveforms from four arterial sites and reference imaging measurements of aneurysm size from at least 217 patients and 217 matchable controls. The specific aims are to develop and validate (1) physics-based methods and (2) machine learning methods for predicting aneurysm size from arterial waveforms. The physics-based methods will fit tube-load models of arterial wave transmission and reflection to the waveforms to estimate parameters indicative of aneurysm size. The machine learning methods will employ linear regression or a neural network and take inputs comprising waveform features such as pulse wave velocity, which decreases with increasing aneurysm diameter as predicted by the well-known Moens-Korteweg equation, and number of local waveform maxima, which may increase with enhanced negative wave reflection induced by aneurysm growth, as well as confounding factors such as blood pressure and age, which also alter pulse wave velocity, to predict aneurysm diameter. These methods will be optimized using a portion of the patient data for application to various combinations of the arterial waveforms (e.g., proximal and distal waveforms or single waveforms). The developed methods will then be tested using the remaining data, while blinded to the reference aneurysm measurements, in terms of their ability to track aneurysm diameter and classify patients versus controls and patients before versus after endovascular repair. The final method will be chosen as the one that best balances accuracy of aneurysm monitoring with convenience of arterial waveform measurements. Successful completion of this project will guide the design and justify the development of a point-of-care device that may ultimately help mitigate aortic aneurysm mortality. PROJECT NARRATIVE An aortic aneurysm – a balloon-like bulge in the body’s main blood vessel – is at risk for rupture, which often leads to death. However, taking a picture of inside the body to make a diagnosis requires an expert-operator and is expensive, and the condition is often left undetected. Research will be performed towards technology that is convenient in use and cost for monitoring aortic aneurysms.","Towards a Convenient, Point-of-Care Device for Screening and Surveillance of Aortic Aneurysms",10125246,R21EB029376,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Aneurysm', 'Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ballistocardiography', 'Blinded', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Elderly man', 'Equation', 'Equilibrium', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Image', 'Left', 'Length', 'Linear Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Palpation', 'Patients', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Screening procedure', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Societies', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'Ultrasonography', 'Veterans', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'prospective test', 'repaired', 'screening', 'skills', 'transmission process', 'tv watching']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,410344
"Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and will affect >110 million people by 2040. Early detection and treatment are critical, as symptoms typically do not present until the disease is advanced. A data-driven precision medicine approach is needed to better identify individuals who are at greatest risk of developing the disease and who are at greatest risk of progressing quickly to vision loss. While there has been considerable progress in eye imaging and testing to improve glaucoma monitoring, precision management of glaucoma is incomplete without accounting for patients' co-existing systemic conditions, concurrent systemic medications and treatments, and adherence with prescribed glaucoma treatment. Understanding how systemic conditions, and specifically vascular conditions such as hypertension, impact glaucoma presents growing public health importance given the increasing co-morbidities facing aging populations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the predictive value of systemic data, even without ophthalmic endpoints. Similarly, measuring medication adherence is important for guiding patient counseling and engagement and avoiding downstream interventions such as surgeries, which carry high cost and morbidity. These factors are important for providing a more comprehensive perspective of glaucoma management and for improving patient outcomes, yet they are relatively understudied. I propose applying multi-modal advancements in health information technology (IT) to address these gaps and achieve the following specific aims: (1) Develop machine learning-based predictive models classifying patients at risk for glaucoma progression using systemic electronic health record (EHR) data from a diverse nationwide patient cohort; (2) evaluate how integrating blood pressure (BP) data from novel smartwatch-based home BP monitors enhance predictive models for risk stratification in glaucoma, and (3) measure glaucoma medication adherence using innovative flexible electronic sensors to validate their use for future interventions aimed at improving adherence and clinical outcomes in glaucoma. These studies would leverage state- of-the-art methods in big-data predictive modeling as well as cutting-edge advancements in sensor technologies. This multi-faceted approach will build a foundation for a health IT framework geared toward improving risk stratification and generating novel therapeutic targets for glaucoma patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE A precision medicine approach is critical for early detection and treatment of glaucoma, an insidious chronic eye disease that can lead to blindness and severely decreased quality of life. The relationship between systemic conditions and treatments with glaucoma progression, as well as methods for monitoring and promoting glaucoma medication adherence, represent areas of glaucoma management that are not well-understood and are thus critical opportunities for technology-driven interventions. This study proposes the development and application of multi- modal health information technology innovations – such as machine learning-based predictive modeling, massive electronic datasets, wearable devices, and flexible sensor electronics – to enhance understanding of glaucoma pathophysiology and identify new potential therapeutic strategies.",Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma,10260459,DP5OD029610,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Blindness', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyedrops', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Home', 'Home Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Human Resources', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Track and Field', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'circadian regulation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data integration', 'early onset', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'faculty community', 'flexibility', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient engagement', 'personalized management', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'racial minority', 'risk stratification', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smart watch', 'treatment adherence', 'wearable device']",OD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP5,2021,394999
"Novel methods and devices to deliver substitution therapy in addiction PROJECT SUMMARY Current treatment options for addiction do not sufficiently address the clinical needs of patients. Due to low efficacy, misaligned treatment objectives, or lack of accessibility, patients are not able to durably abstain from substances or reduce their use to safer levels. Substitution therapy (ST) is a proven treatment approach and has resulted in massive global public health benefits for tobacco use disorder and opioid use disorder; however, the potential impact of ST is limited by concerns for causing more widespread harms. Thus substitution therapy is either underutilized or underexplored in other addictions due to risks of abuse, misuse, and diversion. Through implementing safe prescribing systems, health systems have solved for the provision of existing ST like methadone and buprenorphine. Nevertheless, there remains significant potential for broader access to current and novel ST treatments by utilizing advancement in software and hardware technology. Atman Therapeutics is an early-stage company seeking to develop novel therapeutics in addictive disorders. We are developing a platform to enable increased access to as well as novel development of ST. To achieve this objective, our platform uses cutting-edge machine learning methods, patient-centered research, and sophisticated hardware technology. Our technology will also enable the concurrent delivery of contingency management services, thus creating safe, engaging, and durably effective treatments for these complex neurobehavioral disorders. This Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) project aims to establish the feasibility of machine learning and integrated sensor technologies to confirm medication adherence in a diverse sample of patients. We will develop a deep-learning algorithm utilizing a feed-forward convolutional neural network (CNN), such as ResNet- 50, U-NET, PCU-Net, to enact classification of medication ingestion events. We will also demonstrate the feasibility of integrating a hardware microcontroller unit with multi-dimensional MEMS sensors into a device that can classify ingestion events in a highly sensitive and specific manner. These efforts will demonstrate the early feasibility of the Atman platform and form the basis for regulated development efforts of ST-enabling products and services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposal aims to develop automated methods to confirm ingestion of medication, as this is a critical step to ensure medication compliance. In this proof-of-concept study, we will demonstrate the feasibility of automated ingestion confirmation and integrate hardware components capable of accurately confirming ingestion to enable a novel form of treatment for alcohol use disorder.",Novel methods and devices to deliver substitution therapy in addiction,10325846,R43AA029964,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Austria', 'Buprenorphine', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Benefit', 'Health system', 'Heroin', 'Home', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Ingestion', 'Intake', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Naltrexone', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sales', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social support', 'Sodium Oxybate', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Support Groups', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tobacco Use Disorder', 'Training', 'Unemployment', 'United States', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol use disorder', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'contingency management', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'craving', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'drug of abuse', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'medication compliance', 'meter', 'methadone treatment', 'microphone', 'mobile application', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient oriented', 'portability', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'prevent', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'social engagement', 'socioeconomics', 'standard of care', 'treatment adherence']",NIAAA,ATMAN THERAPEUTICS CO.,R43,2021,253882
"A two-dimensional antiscatter grid for dental cone beam computed tomography Project summary Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a commonly used 3D x-ray imaging modality in dental and craniofacial imaging. While CBCT is primarily employed in evaluating bony anatomy in 3D, soft tissues are often poorly visualized in dental CBCT images. Moreover, tissue densities cannot be extracted accurately from CBCT images. The main culprit behind this problem is scattered radiation. Scattered x-rays emanating from the patient are registered by the x-ray sensor, severely degrading the fidelity of image signals. Thus, in this project, we propose a novel two-dimensional antiscatter grid (2D grid) to substantially improve the dental CBCT image quality. Our proposed 2D grid will attenuate scattered x-rays effectively, while transmitting primary, or useful, x-rays to the image sensor. Once successfully implemented, our 2D grid will provide significantly improved soft tissue visualization, accurate bone density measurement, and will reduce image artifacts. Alternatively, our 2D grid can reduce imaging radiation dose while providing comparable contrast-to- noise ratio with respect to current dental CBCT images. To implement our proposed 2D grid technology, (1) we will investigate the optimal physical characteristics of 2D grids to achieve effective scatter suppression and high primary transmission. (2) We will evaluate the improvement in CBCT image quality provided by 2D grid in phantom imaging experiments. Project narrative While cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is the most commonly used 3D imaging modality in dentistry, its utilization is hampered by its poor image quality. The main culprit behind this problem is the high intensity of scattered radiation inherent to CBCT systems. In this project, we propose a novel device and associated data correction methods to suppress scattered radiation, and improve image quality in dental CBCT.",A two-dimensional antiscatter grid for dental cone beam computed tomography,10258749,R41DE030039,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Attenuated', 'Bone Density', 'Characteristics', 'Cone', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Technology', 'Dentistry', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dose', 'Geometry', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Implant', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Scattering', 'Radiation therapy', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'absorption', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost', 'craniofacial', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'experimental study', 'imager', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient variability', 'physical property', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'soft tissue', 'transmission process', 'two-dimensional']",NIDCR,M2 TECHNOLOGIES LLC,R41,2021,196573
"An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to combine expertise and approaches from biomedical engineering and critical care medicine to design a universal system to acquire, record and transmit physiological signals from bedside monitored patients. Patient monitors generate over a million datapoints of information per hour, however, only a tiny fraction of those data are transmitted or recorded. In order to improve data exchange in healthcare, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was published in 2014. However, it has yet to make a significant impact on Medical Device Integration (MDI), which is the process of automating the flow of clinical data from bedside medical devices, such as patient monitors, to external systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Also, MDI is a complex task because data from these devices are high-frequency and high- volume and because most devices use proprietary protocols and outdated interfaces such as serial cables. Hospitals and researchers have therefore been left with few options except to use expensive and vendor-specific MDI solutions to access these data or to use manual data entry into the patient EMR, which leads to data entry errors, late entry of data, and lost time for clinical care. Manual data entry only captures a tiny fraction of the available data, and with increased research interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, there is a growing need for a standardized way to access the vast amounts of data from bedside devices. This project will develop a vendor-neutral software-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) that acquires and records data from bedside devices across a hospital network and makes live data available to 3rd party systems using a FHIR application programming interface (API). The proposed proof-of-concept will consist of three elements: [i] a transmitter which encrypts and transmits patient signals across the network, [ii] an aggregator which receives, translates and records the signals to a central location, and [iii] a FHIR Server with API for allowing external systems to access live data as FHIR resources. This proposal seeks to create a novel design that will overcome a critical barrier in healthcare, medicine and research. The proposed MDDS will be valuable to hospitals, clinicians, researchers and app developers because it makes data accessible which were previously only available to clinicians at the bedside in real-time. Narrative MediCollector’s proposed vendor-neutral medical device data system (MDDS) will be a valuable research tool to access, acquire and record high-frequency bedside patient monitor data for facilitating clinical research in hospitals. In addition, it will make live patient monitor data accessible to external systems through an HL7 FHIR application programming interface (API), thereby improving interoperability in hospitals and opening the doors to the integration of live data into external systems, such as smartphone apps and artificial intelligence algorithms, which can improve clinical workflow and healthcare in general.",An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment,10353084,R43EB030890,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Equipment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Information Systems', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vendor', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical care', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'design', 'encryption', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'point of care', 'smartphone Application', 'tool']",NIBIB,"MEDICOLLECTOR, LLC",R43,2021,40963
"Periodontal Ultrasound/Photoacoustic Imaging (PUPI) PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of this proposal is to design and validate a Periodontal Ultrasound/Photoacoustic Imaging (PUPI) device which can non-invasively measure periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment loss based on cementoenamel junction (CEJ) location, gingival biotype and inflammation. Current periodontal evaluation methods are inaccurate because they are based on visual inspection and periodontal probing. While radiography offers detailed information about hard tissues such as bone and teeth, more detailed information about soft tissue is usually missed in radiography. Ultrasound/photoacoustic approach has been used in soft tissue imaging but rarely in dentistry because they have a large size transducer which limits the entire oral cavity scan. This is a fundamental limitation of existing technology. To solve this problem, StyloSonic LLC will construct and validate a miniaturized handpiece with a compact laser diode for ultrasound/photoacoustic imaging to provide key periodontal metrics. PUPI offers real-time, accurate, and repeatable measurements with utility in diagnosis and therapy monitoring. That is the value of this proposal. The workflow will include two parts: Aim 1 will design and fabricate the PUPI prototype and Aim 2 will evaluate the fundamental functionality of the device and confirm the validation in a pilot clinical study in collaboration with Dr. Casey Chen at University of Southern California. 100 teeth (5-10 patients) with moderate periodontitis (pocket depth: 4-6 mm) will be evaluated with PUPI and manual probing method before and 4-week after the nonsurgical treatment (i.e., scaling and root planning). That will give us 80% statistical power assuming an alpha of 0.05 based on our preliminary data. Our goal is to build a handpiece that can easily scan the entire oral cavity. We will test the designed miniaturized handpiece using an oral care manikin. We hypothesize that the correlation coefficient between probing and PUPI is R2 > 0.8. We also hypothesize that the PUPI will show a significant difference in pocket depth, clinical attachment loss, gingival biotype and inflammation before and four weeks after treatment (p <0.05). This approach is innovative because for the first time, the miniaturized handpiece of PUPI will provide anatomical and functional information of the entire gingiva architecture. In addition, PUPI will enable accurate diagnostics and therapy monitoring which add enormous value for recommended treatment and ensure best outcomes. The clinical impact is the proposed device will assist dentists and periodontists to accurately diagnose gingivitis in the early stage and reduce the rate of advanced periodontitis. This work will introduce a non-invasive and non- ionizing dual modality imaging technique which has significant impacts on oral health care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Dental health is critical to quality of life, but the tools that dentists use for periodontal exams are largely anatomical and inspect the gingiva by eye or periodontal charting. This work will develop and validate a non- invasive Periodontal Ultrasound/Photoacoustic Imaging (PUPI) with a miniaturized handpiece.

"An Integrated Software Platform for Accelerating Image-Driven Ophthalmic Research and Driving New Insights and Endpoints to the Clinic ABSTRACT More than 20 million patients suffer from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma. These degenerative eye diseases develop over decades, and their prevalence is increasing. Retinal imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography and adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy are essential tools in the investigation and management of eye disease. New quantitative biomarkers derived from these and other imaging modalities are critical to the clinical translation of emerging ophthalmic innovations. However, biomarker development in the era of artificial intelligence requires large volumes of annotated images and transparent, reproducible processes, which places new demands on the management of living subjects research, data sharing, and algorithm development. Unfortunately, current software platforms are not effective in integrating these data in a manner that meets specific requirements in ophthalmology, Our goal in this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR, consistent with objectives of the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science, is to create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, analysis, and sharing of ocular images and data. We will extend the capabilities of systems developed by the Advanced Ocular Imaging Program (AOIP), Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), which include: (a) LATTICE - a software solution that reduces costs, reduces errors, and improves communications in the management of living-subjects research; (b) MOSAIC - an image processing platform and algorithm library with traditional and AI-trained algorithms; and (c) The AOIP Image Bank - a Repository that houses images and data on 1578 fully-consent human research subjects. To create the integrative platform, we will address four aims: (a) Extend LATTICE to meet the workflow requirements of academic and sponsored research in local and multisite environments, including the extensible direct integration of data relevant to ocular studies; (b) Design and implement a hybrid (local + cloud) REPOSITORY architecture, data schema, knowledge ontology, and query architecture for Owners and Readers of data.; (c) Integrate and demonstrate LATTICE, REPOSITORY and MOSAIC into a continuous ocular science workflow and (d) integrate and demonstrate Lattice, Repository and Mosaic into a continuous ocular science workflow. Our Integrated Translational Imaging platform will enable ophthalmic innovators to translate sight-saving insights and interventions to the clinic faster, with less frustration, and greater confidence. Our proposal fills an important technology gap in the field of ophthalmic data science and biomarker development. While the number and type of imaging devices continues to grow, the tools to develop and deploy new biomarkers and clinical endpoints using these exquisite imaging devices has not kept pace. With this program we will enable a new generation of image-driven innovation to find its way to the clinic. Project Narrative With more than 20 million patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma, it is crucial to develop non-invasive biomarkers as early predictors of eye disease and reliable tests of the safety and efficacy of new preventative and restorative therapies.

"Flexible Piezoelectric Array for Cardiovascular MonitoringDuring Cardiac Arrest Project Summary In situations of out of hospital cardiac arrest, it is critical to quickly detect the performance of adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) through clinically acceptable pulse rate and blood pressure (BP). However, the detection of adequate CPR can be difficult for someone not trained in first aid. Currently the standard for measuring BP noninvasively is using cuff-based oscillometeric approaches. Attempts at developing these into wearable devices for automated and continuous measurements have proven difficult and so researchers have looked at other methods. However, these methods have not met the criteria for flexibility, accuracy, and low power consumption. This project aims to develop a flexible patch for accurate detection of pulse rate and blood pressure superficially through the radial, brachial, carotid, and/or femoral arteries. Piezoelectric polymers, are inherently flexible and have been used in many applications for pressure sensing, offering great potential for use as a patch-like sensor for monitoring of cardiovascular function. However, in the standard form, the material is not sensitive enough to accurately detect blood pressure. In our lab we have developed a core-shell nanofiber structure of conductive and piezoelectric nanofibers, respectively. The core-shell nanostructure shows a 4.5 times improvement in pressure sensitivity when compared to standard piezoelectric nanofibers and a nearly 40 times improvement when compared to piezoelectric polymer thin films. This improvement in pressure sensitivity should allow for a wearable device composed of these materials to exceed the necessary 35 dB signal to noise ratio required for the accurate detection of pulse wave velocity, a cardiovascular parameter used to determine blood pressure. Coupled with inkjet printing patterning techniques of conductive polymers developed in our lab, we propose to fabricate a novel core-shell nanofiber piezoelectric array in a wearable patch form for cardiovascular monitoring. In order to test this piezoelectric array and develop data-driven algorithms for the detection of blood pressure, testing will occur on a controllable simulated cardiovascular system capable of replicating a human’s diastolic and systolic blood pressures, pulse rates, and arterial mechanical properties. The blood pressure attainable by the simulated system falls within the AAMI standard benchmark for accuracy and precision for noninvasive blood pressure monitoring of 5 ± 8 mmHg. We will train various regression models using the data generated from this system to relate the detected pulse wave velocities to blood pressure and we will compare the outcomes to commonly used correlation equations. We propose that the fabrication methods we will develop, when coupled together with data-driven algorithms, will allow for the development of a low- power, flexible patch, capable of detecting pulse rate and blood pressure, giving feedback on the adequacy of CPR. Project Narrative This project plans to develop a patch-like sensor for detecting cardiovascular signals including pulse rate and blood pressure for situations of out of hospital cardiac arrest. The proposed research couples a novel core-shell piezoelectric nanostructure with an inkjet printing method for fabricating flexible arrays, to create a new class of wearable patch-like sensors for cardiovascular monitoring. Testing these sensors on a controllable simulated cardiovascular system, will allow for the development of data-driven algorithms to improve the accuracy of these devices, leading to highly accurate, patch-like cardiovascular sensing.",Flexible Piezoelectric Array for Cardiovascular MonitoringDuring Cardiac Arrest,10288237,R21EB032056,"['Algorithms', 'Arteries', 'Benchmarking', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'First Aid', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Heart Arrest', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ink', 'Liquid substance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Polymers', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Pulse Rates', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structure', 'Sulfur', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'detection method', 'falls', 'femoral artery', 'first responder', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mechanical properties', 'nanofiber', 'novel', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'polyvinylidene fluoride', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'pulse pressure wave', 'radial artery', 'random forest', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R21,2021,232061
"A simulation-based technology for stochastic modeling, sensitivity analysis and design optimization, aimed at development of next-generation micro-fluidic devices for biomedical applications. During an epidemic, testing numerous patients puts a heavy burden on the healthcare sector, while infections continue to rise in the absence of a treatment. In such a scenario, micro-fluidics technology can be used to develop affordable point-of-care diagnostic tools for detecting infected patients early, and effective drug discovery platforms for synthesizing therapeutic drugs. The development of such devices is extremely challenging, needing expertise in multiple disciplines (e.g. physics, chemistry, biology), and understanding the interplay between variables that influence operating performance requires computational assistance. While advanced design software may be adopted to simulate the performance of such devices, precise knowledge of prediction reliability is of paramount importance to ensure their suitability for clinical decision-making. Therefore, the long term objectives of this project are to commercially introduce a new paradigm of digital engineering design that focuses on evaluating the fluctuations in performance outputs due to variability in input parameters and to demonstrate the relevance of such a simulation-based technology through specific application to development of micro-fluidic biomedical devices. The envisioned proof-of-concept is a modular computational system with practical commercial applications in the healthcare sector that demonstrates how scientific computing, numerical simulation & artificial intelligence modeling approaches can lead to an increased understanding of the performance of a micro-fluidic system subject to operating uncertainty, and enable robust design optimization. The proposed approach is to employ innovative stochastic spectral methods & advanced numerical schemes to conduct computationally efficient, high fidelity simulations involving uncertainty quantification & propagation, model sensitivity analysis, and finite element analysis for the engineering evaluation of progressively complex micro-fluidic device designs, and to incorporate artificial intelligence based meta-modeling techniques to perform design space exploration for performance improvement of such devices. The R&D efforts would establish the technical merits & feasibility of a simulation- based technology for predictive stochastic analysis & multi-disciplinary engineering evaluation of novel micro- fluidic devices that addresses the need for efficient & accurate performance assessment of such devices in practical (often uncertain/variable) operating scenarios. It could subsequently be utilized by biomedical engineers to foster the rapid development of robust next-generation devices that operate reliably within desired operating performance specifications, such as diagnostic tools with improved detection sensitivity & specificity, and drug discovery platforms with enhanced reconstitution of complex cellular interactions. These can play a crucial role in rapid short-term response to control the spread of infections & to mitigate disease outbreaks, while also offering improved solutions for enhancing long-term access to primary healthcare & comprehensive disease treatment, thereby significantly improving public health, particularly in resource constrained settings. Infectious ailments affect more than 400M people worldwide annually, accounting for almost 30% of disability- adjusted-life-years (DALYs, i.e. number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death), and for many of these conditions, bringing affordable diagnosis & effective therapeutic drugs to the point-of-need is key to reducing morbidity and mortality. In this regard, micro-fluidics technology can be used to develop diagnostic tools for pathogen detection that offer quick turnaround, clinically relevant detection limit, & portability, and drug discovery platforms for therapeutic drug synthesis that offer rapid screening, high throughput, & reduced cost. The rising popularity of such technology and its growing demand is driving innovation toward devices that need to exhibit precision, durability, repeatability & reliability, and the proposed stochastic simulation-based technology would support the development of such robust solutions, resulting in safer, more effective biomedical devices that improve public health globally.","A simulation-based technology for stochastic modeling, sensitivity analysis and design optimization, aimed at development of next-generation micro-fluidic devices for biomedical applications.",10323474,R43EB032276,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Computer software', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment Malfunction', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Food Safety', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Genes', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Sector', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Polynomial Models', 'Primary Health Care', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Rapid screening', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Design', 'Space Explorations', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thermal Conductivity', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'design', 'detection limit', 'detection sensitivity', 'digital', 'disability', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'drug discovery', 'drug synthesis', 'effective therapy', 'engineering design', 'global health', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'microfluidic technology', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'novel', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'portability', 'practical application', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'rapid detection', 'reconstitution', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'response', 'scientific computing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool']",NIBIB,SOFTWORTHY LLC,R43,2021,232115

"Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment. PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid overdose rates have risen six-fold since the late 1990s and presently claim the lives of over 130 Americans each day. Amongst treatment options for opioid dependence, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with opioid substitutes, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, are the only treatments for which effectiveness has been confirmed by empirical study. While methadone maintenance is effective for reducing mortality over the course of treatment, individuals remain at significant risk of overdose death during the initial phase of treatment (methadone induction). On the other hand, although buprenorphine has lower risk of mortality, it is associated with greater risk of withdrawal and relapse. Therefore, patient monitoring is critical for effective MAT, improved treatment retention and reduced likelihood of overdose death. Yet, MAT is most commonly administered on an outpatient basis, limiting the time periods during which the patient can be actively assessed. OpiAID is developing the Strength Band Platform, a wearable device featuring a multi-sensor array and artificial intelligence to facilitate patient monitoring during MAT for opioid use disorder. This device will provide an expanded range of biometric variables enabling prediction of opioid use and withdrawal in real world settings. Real-time monitoring of patients will allow appropriate and timely interventions, directly improving the outcomes for the patients undergoing the treatment. There are currently no FDA approved, commercially available, wearable products for monitoring opioid use in real world settings. This Phase I SBIR program consists of two Specific Aims designed to develop the Strength Band Platform using a commercially available clinically validated armband. The first Specific Aim is to collect biometric variables from patients and develop prediction algorithms through supervised learning. In the second Specific Aim, barriers to end-user adoption, compliance and social stigma will be identified through focus groups and solutions based on the feedback will be incorporated into development frameworks. Completion of this Phase I project will produce a proof-of-concept platform which will undergo further development and evaluation for commercialization. Phase II research will focus on developing fully functional user and practitioner interfaces and completing multi-region clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness of the platform for improving patient outcomes. OpiAID will leverage extensive partnerships in the opioid dependence treatment community in Wilmington, NC to evaluate performance of the device and complete the clinical trials. Ultimately, identifying periods of increased risk of relapse will allow provision of just-in-time interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE To address the opioid crisis, OpiAID is developing a wearable biometric device platform that will predict use and withdrawal in patients undergoing medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder. Using a wearable device for real-time monitoring with predictive capability will allow timely interventions resulting in fewer deaths and relapses.","Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment.",10339121,R43DA050399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Maintenance', 'Methadone', 'Monitor', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid Rotation', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'methadone treatment', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'overdose death', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'relapse risk', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'supervised learning', 'wearable device']",NIDA,"OPIAID, LLC",R43,2021,55000
"Digital Therapeutic Development of Virtual Cognitive-Affective Training for Opioid Use Disorder Project Summary: The US is experiencing an opioid crisis, with an estimated 2.5 million Americans meeting full criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most effective form of intervention for OUD. In spite of the proven efficacy of MOUD, nearly half of people who begin a MOUD relapse within six months. As such, novel and efficacious behavioral adjuncts to MOUD are needed to improve treatment outcomes. Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a cognitive-affective training intervention generated through a NIDA-funded treatment development process has shown significant promise, demonstrating therapeutic effects in four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by reducing opioid use and misuse and modulating neurophysiological responses during drug cue-reactivity and natural reward processing. However, the MORE intervention requires significant human interaction and is therefore resource intensive. Further, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, people with OUD may be reticent to engage in face-to-face interventions due to the risk of viral spread. To overcome these implementation barriers and increase access to treatment, the proposed project will develop and test a virtual reality version of the MORE intervention (MORE-VR) built on BehaVR LLC's VR existing, commercially available platform, the Dynamic eXperience Engine (DXE). The DXE uses machine learning to integrate biometrics into the VR experience to personalize addictions treatment, boosting patient engagement and optimizing the efficacy of clinical intervention. In Phase I, we will develop and test the MORE-VR prototype in a single arm clinical study of OUD patients receiving buprenorphine in an opioid treatment program (OTP), focusing on patient safety and engagement. If the prototype is perceived to have adequate usability and Net Promoter Scores, as well as to produce improvements in proximal measures of craving and affective state, the project will progress to Phase II. In Phase II, we will first develop the MORE-VR Minimal Viable Program using feedback from our Phase I study to optimize the intervention, and then conduct a RCT of MORE-VR vs. MOUD treatment as usual. Our robust and unbiased research design will triangulate clinical outcome measurement with biochemical verification of abstinence, ecological momentary assessments (EMA), and neurophysiological assessment of cue-reactivity. Further, we will integrate the MORE-VR Program into the OTP operational environment, building Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources interfaces to ingest patient data from electronic medical records (EMRs) and to export patient utilization, assessment, and biometric data back to EMRs to create patient records and inform clinicians of patient progress. Activities in Phase I and Phase II will help define the regulatory pathway and establish regulatory feasibility to precede Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the MORE-VR system as a Class II medical device. In sum, this project will translate an evidence- based biobehavioral treatment approach into an innovative digital therapeutic for OUD. Project Narrative Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most effective form of intervention for opioid use disorder (OUD); however, novel behavioral adjuncts are needed to remediate dysregulation in brain reward systems, enhance MOUD adherence, and prevent relapse. BehaVR, LLC will meet this need by translating an evidence-based biobehavioral treatment approach into an innovative digital therapeutic for OUD that will increase accessibility to services to improve the patient's chances of long-term treatment success.",Digital Therapeutic Development of Virtual Cognitive-Affective Training for Opioid Use Disorder,10255561,R44DA053848,"['Abstinence', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'American', 'Area Under Curve', 'Back', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teleconferences', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Viral', 'addiction', 'affective neuroscience', 'arm', 'barrier to care', 'biobehavior', 'chronic pain', 'clinical efficacy', 'commercialization', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'design', 'digital treatment', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation barriers', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mindfulness', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid treatment program', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'patient safety', 'phase 1 study', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'response', 'reward processing', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment program', 'treatment risk', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'virtual', 'virtual machine', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality system']",NIDA,"BEHAVR, LLC",R44,2021,319021
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome.

"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,10144919,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'detection platform', 'experience', 'home test', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2021,1807912
"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",10188391,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2021,289385
"BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline ABSTRACT Clinical Need: As the US population ages, managing pathologies that largely affect older adults, including sarcopenia (e.g., loss of muscle mass and strength), represents a significant and growing clinical challenge. In addition to increased rates of sarcopenia with age, it is well-accepted that its incidence and impact increases after acute illness, placing persons at additional risk for functional decline, institutionalization, or death. Resistance-based exercises promote muscle regeneration and strength, and are an advised therapy for such patients. Yet, exercises are normally conducted either under direct clinical oversight, or unsupervised by patients at home, where compliance rates are low. Limitations: Current regimens rely on self-report diaries or verbal reports that may be inaccurate and subject to recall bias. Remote monitoring systems that measure, track, analyze, and provide patient-oriented feedback may overcome these limitations and enhance exercise regimen engagement. An at-home device that monitors and transmits exercise data to the user and clinician represents a potential solution to this clinical challenge. Our Product – BandPass is a remote-sensing, bluetooth-enabled resistance exercise band that will accurately gauge force through a potentiometric sensor rigidly fixed to elastic-tubing purposely designed for resistance training. The device is similar to currently available exercise bands familiar to clinicians and patients, with the significant novel addition of integrated force monitoring and internet-connectivity. A mobile app and cloud-based platform will provide computational resources for data visualization, storage and analysis, which will enable direct patient feedback, clinical monitoring of patient compliance and progress, and serve as a platform for more advanced operations such as automatic exercise-type classification to ease user burden (e.g., minimizing required interactions between the user and mobile device). We hypothesize that BandPass will provide clinically relevant data on compliance and use of exercise training with feedback that will be personalized. Specific Objectives: We specifically propose to design custom electronics and housing for BandPass and to perform in-lab validation studies of device accuracy, precision, and long-term stability. BandPass will be interfaced to a mobile app and cloud-based platform we will implement for data transmission, storage, and analysis. Finally, we will deploy BandPass in a human subjects pilot study to demonstrate usability and system stability in an at-home setting. Future Directions: SynchroHealth is a small company developing an mHealth platform that uses internet-connected devices to help improve quality of life in older adults. This device will complement our existing efforts. By the end of this Phase 1 effort, we will have demonstrated that BandPass is functional in a human population and we will have provided evidence that this approach can be deployed effectively in an at-home setting. This will position us for Phase 2 funding focused on optimizing our device for manufacturing, developing and optimizing a full suite of cloud-based analysis tools and mobile applications, conducting clinical trials aimed at demonstrating efficacy, and preparing to register this as a 510(k)-exempt device for marketing purposes and establishing Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP). PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical care for older adults that suffer from sarcopenia (e.g. loss of muscle mass and strength) typically involves the use of physical therapy regimens that rely on patients performing a series of at-home resistance-based exercises in order to retain or build muscle strength and prevent further atrophy. Resistance exercises using elastic bands has been a primary tool for clinicians, however remotely monitoring a patient’s compliance, confirming the quality of exercises performed, and tracking performance has been a significant challenge, with no tools currently available to provide this level of insight. Here, we propose to develop BandPass, an internet-enable resistance exercise band instrumented to automatically sense forces generated during exercise which will enable remote monitoring, compliance checking, and exercise classification and help to overcome the current shortcomings in clinical management of these patients.",BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline,10152884,R41AG071290,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Atrophic', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Equipment', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health', 'Home', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institutionalization', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Orthopedics', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'age-related muscle loss', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'compliance behavior', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data visualization', 'design', 'diaries', 'exercise regimen', 'exercise training', 'functional decline', 'handheld mobile device', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'monitoring device', 'muscle form', 'muscle regeneration', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'operation', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'remote monitoring', 'remote sensing', 'resistance exercise', 'sarcopenia', 'sensor', 'strength training', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NIA,SYNCHROHEALTH LLC,R41,2021,224700
"Predicting Short- and Long-term Future Occurrence of Atrial Fibrillation from Single-Lead ECG in Normal Sinus Rhythm with an Explainable Deep Learning Model. Project Summary/Abstract More than 30 million individuals worldwide are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF), however, another 13% of individuals with AF are left undiagnosed. People with AF have a five-fold increased risk of stroke with up to one-third of all strokes shown to be related to AF. Timely administration of appropriate preventative therapies, especially anticoagulants, can significantly decrease the complications of AF, including strokes, by 65% and mortality by 30%. Digital health technologies offer new approaches to identify individuals with undiagnosed AF, in particular paroxysmal AF (PAF), characterized by occasional episodes of limited duration, for whom a 10-second 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) performed in the clinical setting is unlikely to overlap with an AF event. Continuous monitoring is promising, but still costly and burdensome for elderly individuals, who are at higher risk. To maximize the diagnostic yield of these technologies, we propose novel methods to predict the future occurrence of AF from a single-lead ECG during normal sinus rhythm. Only recently it was shown that it is possible to predict the future occurrence of AF from 12-lead ECGs in normal sinus rhythm collected in a clinical setting. Here, we propose to predict the occurrence of AF with commercially available single- lead ECG devices, which will enable a scalable alternative for early detection in a non-clinical setting. To achieve this goal, we will analyze retrospectively the raw single-lead ECG data of 10,000+ individuals with PAF over 14 days of monitoring. Validation work will then be carried out in a unique set of 1,718 asymptomatic individuals who participated in the prospective mSToPS clinical trial of AF screening (mean age 73), with full clinical information and co-morbidities. The three aims of this project are:  1. Compute the probability of a future AF event in the short-term for an individual in normal sinus rhythm using classic single-lead ECG features and representation learning based features.  2. Develop a method for long-term prediction of AF onset by evaluating individuals with AF detected in 1, 3, 6 and 12 months from the initial monitored period of normal sinus rhythm and by validating the algorithms using the mSToPS dataset with 3 years of clinical follow-up and annotated co-morbidities.  3. Develop a technique to provide a preliminary interpretation of representation learning features for time-series data applied to the short- and long-term prediction. This retrospective study will develop and optimize new predictive techniques from single-lead ECGs, available through consumer devices, with the goal of identifying individuals at high risk of developing AF. A future direction to build on from this study's results would include a prospective study of AF prediction using consumer single-lead ECG to improve clinical outcomes. Project Narrative In this project we propose novel methods to predict the future occurrence of AF from single-lead ECGs during normal sinus rhythm, collected from commercially available single-lead ECG devices, which will enable a scalable alternative for early detection in a non-clinical setting.

"A MULTIFACETED DIGITAL HEALTH PLATFORM TO ADVANCE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATIENT MONITORING, SAFETY, CARE, AND RESEARCH. Project Summary Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias (ADRD) are projected to affect 50 million Americans by 2050. In 2019, more than 16 million Americans struggled while providing unpaid care for people with AD/ADRD and they need stigma-free solutions to help remotely monitor challenging AD/ADRD behaviors like falling and wandering. Separate but related, many AD/ADRD clinical trials are siloed and require patient volunteers and their caregivers to travel to in-person appointments. This is burdensome for families, increases the cost to conduct studies, and data collected is often non-representative of daily life. Amissa Inc. has developed a stigma- free, prototype solution to significantly advance AD/ADRD patient monitoring, safety, and caregiving while simultaneously aggregating high-frequency digital biomarkers to advance medical research. Several competitors have developed hardware devices for tracking elderly individuals who wander and/or fall however, AD/ADRD patients express feelings of stress, anxiety, humiliation, burden, and stigma associated with dementia when wearing these “special” devices. AD/ADRD caregivers seek “socially-acceptable” devices that improve health and location monitoring, provide peace of mind, reduce worry, improve patient safety and quality of life without loved ones feeling shame or embarrassment. Amissa’s prototype software application, created for widely available, consumer-grade smartwatches, enables families to remotely monitor when loved ones fall inside or outside the home and help prevent dangerous wandering episodes. Our initial software application also sends emergency push notifications to key stakeholders when loved ones exhibit uncommon behaviors (e.g. sudden change in variable heart rate). This Phase I SBIR proposal is designed to develop a platform which passively and unobtrusively collects time-based behavioral and biometric data from AD/ADRD patient smartwatches in real-life settings to improve caregiving while also establishing a high-frequency cloud database where one does not currently exist for AD/ADRD research. Aim 1 will develop a caregiver-designed AD/ADRD patient monitoring application for off-the-shelf consumer smartwatches and conduct user-experience and user-interface testing to facilitate feedback for iterative product design improvement. Utilizing opt-in user data from Amissa’s caregiver monitoring application, Aim 2 will establish a novel high-frequency behavioral and biometric cloud database to advance AD/ADRD digital biomarker research capabilities to predict patient falls an wandering. Amissa’s project intends to enable faster collection of multimodal data via broader demographic populations to advance AD/ADRD medical research. This Phase I SBIR has the potential for high impact by providing a single, low-cost, digital technology solution to improve AD/ADRD patient care and safety while reducing stress for caregivers and families. Furthermore, this research will improve capabilities and reduce costs of conducting decentralized clinical trials in real-life environments. At scale, our goal is to advance the forecasting of symptom trajectories and enable physicians to suggest personalized preventative treatments to delay onset or prevent AD/ADRD. Project Narrative Utilizing consumer-grade smartwatches and a cloud-based analytics platform to support real-time, real- world, passive and unobtrusive collection of biometric and behavioral data, this project aims to develop and test a free downloadable mobile application to significantly improve remote patient monitoring of people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias (ADRD). This Phase I SBIR aims to reduce caregiver/partner stress and worry by providing a low-cost resource to monitor loved ones with challenging behaviors and, as an easily downloaded mobile application, this project aims to broadly expand capabilities to conduct remote/decentralized clinical trials and support the evaluation of community-based objective outcomes. The proposed research is clinically relevant as it could deliver large sets of high-frequency data to identify and validate digital biomarkers and improve knowledge about the behaviors of people with AD/ADRD in free-living environments.","A MULTIFACETED DIGITAL HEALTH PLATFORM TO ADVANCE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATIENT MONITORING, SAFETY, CARE, AND RESEARCH.",10325493,R43AG072981,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Americas', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Fees', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Home', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal trends', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Mind', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Notification', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Exercise', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Rural Population', 'S Phase', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Shame', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stigmatization', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'community based evaluation', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'data exchange', 'design', 'digital', 'digital health', 'experience', 'falls', 'handheld mobile device', 'humiliation', 'improved', 'insight', 'lifestyle intervention', 'loved ones', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'modifiable behavior', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'peace', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'remote monitoring', 'remote patient monitoring', 'rural underserved', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'sleep behavior', 'smart watch', 'social', 'social stigma', 'socialization behavior', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIA,"AMISSA, INC.",R43,2021,495787
"Low cost, automated smartphone based assay for semen analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Consumers are increasingly interested in knowing more about their own health. One of the most familiar direct to-consumer diagnostic tests has been the home pregnancy test. We report a practical approach towards developing a new point-of-care diagnostic test for another reproductive health need—the assessment of male fertility. Traditionally, men are less likely to seek medical attention for fertility concerns than their female partners (although millennial males are more interested in fertility testing). A delay in diagnosis of male factor infertility may prolong the infertility treatment process for the couple and result in unnecessary interventions for the female partner. Manual microscopic testing and computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) technology are expensive and require significant technical skill to use. The idea of an at-home, affordable testing platform to screen for an abnormal semen analysis would obviate the need for a clinic visit and provide preliminary data to guide referrals. Our prototype device has been extensively tested with clinical semen samples. The preliminary results presented are robust and unbiased and patient results are based on blind evaluation of the technology by comparing our microchip results with standard methods. In this Fast Track SBIR project we will further optimize the design parameters and develop a best in class, cellphone-based semen analysis device that could be marketed to a) for home based testing and b) as an inexpensive alternative to CASA in IVF clinics.

"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Clinical Evaluation of Burns using Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Durkin, Anthony J. Abstract The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and apply a new, compact, clinic- friendly Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) device to objectively and non-invasively classify burn severity (burn grade) over a large areas of skin. Delays in determining burn severity directly impacts patient treatment plans (including decisions whether to graft), rates of infection and scarring, duration of hospitalization and ultimately cost of care. Currently, the primary method of determining burn severity continues to be clinical assessment, which is highly subjective. While both superficial thickness and full-thickness burns are typically readily diagnosed based on visual clinical impression, partial thickness burns are difficult to classify and carry with them considerable potential for complications. Burn severity classification accuracy, even by experts, is only 60–80%. Our research in animal models demonstrates that SFDI data can successfully be used to classify different regions of burn severities. Typically, these differences are not apparent to the unaided eye and a great deal of training and experience is required in order for clinicians to accurately differentiate them Our work using a research grade, hybrid-SFDI device suggests that objective parameters provided by SFDI can be used within 24 hours after injury, to accurately classify burn severity. Specifically, we have demonstrated in a porcine burn model that the research grade SFDI outperforms laser speckle imaging and thermal imaging at 24 hours post-burn, in terms of predicting whether a burn will require a graft or not. However, translating these results to the clinic has been difficult due to several device limitations. The research grade SFDI device has slow acquisition times that can result in motion artifacts. It is also sensitive to ambient light which is often an issue in a clinical setting. Additionally, the SFDI device generates so much diverse data (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, water fraction, reduced scattering coefficients at multiple wavelengths), there is no obvious way to present it to a clinical user to make a quick decision. To this end, we propose to methodically investigate an improved next generation SFDI device that addresses these issues by using brighter LEDs and fewer wavelengths to rapidly collect data in a way that reduces motion artifacts and is independent of clinical lighting conditions. In addition, we will develop a machine learning based classification framework that will provide the clinical with actionalble diagnostic information. The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and then modify a new clinic-friendly SFDI device (Clarifi) to objectively classify in- vivo regions of different burn severity over large areas. The proposed research seeks to investigate this via the following Specific Aims: 1) Test & Validate Clinical SFDI Instrument, 2) Compare Clinical SFDI Instrument to other Modalities on a Long Term Swine Model of Graded Burns, 3) Develop Spatially Resolved Classification Maps of Burn Severity based on SFDI Data, 4) Conduct Clinical Measurements of Burn Severity using the new SFDI device and Spatially Resolved Burn Severity Classification Maps based on SFDI data. Program Director (Last, first, middle): Durkin, Anthony J. PROJECT NARRATIVE Burn injuries rank in the top 15 causes of global burden of disease. Burn severity assessment, which is a critical step in treatment planning, is subjective, depending on the experience of the treating physician. This leads to misdiagnosis and increased days of hospitalization and cost. In order to address this, we propose to test, validate and apply a novel optical imaging device in order to provide noninvasive objective assessment of burn wound severity. This has the potential to improve management of burn patients and reduce rates of complications.",Clinical Evaluation of Burns using Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging,10224221,R01GM108634,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Burn Centers', 'Burn injury', 'Cicatrix', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enrollment', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Female', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Injury', 'Laser Speckle Imaging', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ulcer', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'burn model', 'burn wound', 'care costs', 'clinical imaging', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data integrity', 'data modeling', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'healing', 'human data', 'imaging system', 'impression', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'male', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'porcine model', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'second degree burn', 'stability testing', 'third degree burn', 'treatment planning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2021,441099
"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children.

"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,10131881,R01NS112497,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neocortex', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'computational intelligence', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2021,459231
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co- occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self- regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than 33% of American adults while weight loss regimens rely on self- monitoring that many people struggle with. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily.

"Automating and Obtaining FDA Approval for a Digital Intervention for Depression Phase IIB Abstract -FINAL A large body of evidence supports the idea that disruptions in the regularity of behavioral routines (or ‘social rhythms’) can lead to the onset of mood symptoms and full-blown episodes via their impact on endogenous circadian rhythms and, conversely, that stable social routines protect against new mood episodes. Based on our conviction that monitoring, evaluating, and increasing the regularity of behavioral rhythms has broad applicability for improving mental health, we established HealthRhythms, Inc. (www.healthrhythms.com) with the goal of using mobile technology to enhance our capacity to monitor and treat such conditions, with a particular emphasis on mood disorders. Our product vision capitalizes on the ubiquity and intimacy of smartphones and their capacity to automatically and continuously sense parameters of behavior that represent key indicators of depressive symptomatology captured on a 24/7 basis in the user’s natural environment. It also capitalizes on the capacity of smartphones to deliver interventions that are easily accessible, can be delivered with optimal timing and, perhaps most important, are enormously scalable. Finally, smartphone technology gives us the capacity to bring empirically validated psychosocial interventions to the hundreds of thousands of depressed patients who otherwise would not be able to access such interventions and, thus, speed their recovery and prevent relapse. Under the auspices of our Phase II SBIR funding (R44MH113520-01-02), we have developed both such a monitoring product (Measure) and have developed and tested such a digital intervention platform (Cue). Analyses conducted to date indicate that Cue leads to significantly greater decreases in depressive symptomatology than monitoring alone via Measure. We now propose to: 1) upgrade to Cue and its accompanying clinician dashboard to be commercially marketable and 2) carry out the clinical trial necessary for FDA licensing of Cue 2.0 as a mobile device. Cue 2.0 will include enhanced designs, more in-depth psychoeducational material, and a fully automated engine for delivering behavior change suggestions to improve the regularity of users’ social and behavioral routines. Building on the accomplishments of our Phase II funding, this SBIR Phase IIB proposal is focused on bringing Cue to market as a scientifically validated and profitable digital intervention for individuals with depression with or without co-occurring anxiety disorder. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Develop and validate Cue 2.0 a fully automated digital intervention platform. Aim 2: Carry out all necessary steps to apply for FDA licensing of Cue 2.0. PROJECT NARRATIVE HealthRhythms, Inc. is on a mission to become the world leader in tracking clinically meaningful behavioral rhythms in order to provide automated behavior change suggestions to patients around the globe. The work we propose in this SBIR Phase IIB application will enable HealthRhythms to further develop Cue, our smartphone-based intervention platform for depression, and carry out the work necessary to obtain FDA clearance for Cue as a medical device. This will enable us to bring a tested psychosocial treatment to the hundreds of thousands of depressed patients who otherwise would not be able to access such treatment and, thus, speed their recovery and prevent relapse.",Automating and Obtaining FDA Approval for a Digital Intervention for Depression,10232417,R44MH113520,"['Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consultations', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'convict', 'dashboard', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital intervention', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'intimate behavior', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'mood symptom', 'prevent', 'psychoeducational', 'psychosocial', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'usability']",NIMH,"HEALTH RHYTHMS, INC.",R44,2021,975523
"Web-based Automated Imaging Differentiation of Parkinsonism SUMMARY Across the globe, there has been a considerable growth in the number of people diagnosed with Parkinsonism. Estimates indicate that from 1990 to 2015 the number of Parkinsonism diagnoses doubled, with more than 6 million people currently carrying the diagnosis, and by year 2040, 12 and 14.2 million people will be diagnosed with Parkinsonism. Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy Parkinsonian variant (MSAp), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are neurodegenerative forms of Parkinsonism, which can be difficult to diagnose as they share similar motor and non-motor features, and they each have an increased chance of developing dementia. In the first five years of a PD diagnosis, about 58% of PD are misdiagnosed, and of these misdiagnoses about half have either MSA or PSP. Since PD, MSAp, and PSP require unique treatment plans and different medications, and clinical trials testing new medications require the correct diagnosis, there is an urgent need for both clinic ready and clinical-trial ready markers for differential diagnosis of PD, MSAp, and PSP. Over the past decade, we have developed diffusion imaging as an innovative biomarker for differentiating PD, MSAp, and PSP. In this proposal, we will leverage our extensive experience to create a web-based software tool that can process diffusion imaging data from anywhere in the world. We will disseminate and test the tool in the largest prospective cohort of participants with Parkinsonism (PD, MSAp, PSP), working closely with the Parkinson Study Group. The reason to test this in the Parkinson Study Group network, is because they are the community that evaluates Phase II and Phase III clinical trials in Parkinsonism. This web-based software tool will be capable of reading raw diffusion imaging data, performing quality assurance procedures, analyzing the data using a validated pipeline, and providing imaging metrics and diagnostic probability. We will test the performance of the wAID-P by enrolling 315 total subjects (105 PD, 105 MSAp, 105 PSP) across 21 sites in the Parkinson Study Group. Each site will perform imaging, clinical scales, diagnosis, and will upload the data to the web-based software tool. The clinical diagnosis will be blinded to the diagnostic algorithm and the imaging diagnosis will be compared to the movement disorders trained neurologist diagnosis. We will also enroll a portion of the cohort into a brain bank to ascertain pathological confirmation and to test the algorithm against cases with post-mortem diagnoses. The final outcome will be to disseminate a validated diagnostic algorithm to the Parkinson neurological and radiological community and to make it available to all on a website. NARRATIVE In this proposal, we will be developing, disseminating, and evaluating a web-based software tool that can perform MRI analyses for the diagnostic accuracy of Parkinsonism. Our goal is to leverage our years of experience and algorithm development, to test a prospective cohort of Parkinson’s disease, Multiple System Atrophy, and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. We expect that at the end of the project, we will have validated a web-based software tool that can use MRIs from different vendors to read, analyze, and predict the diagnosis of different forms of Parkinsonism.",Web-based Automated Imaging Differentiation of Parkinsonism,10106864,U01NS119562,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Area Under Curve', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Water', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm development', 'atypical parkinsonism', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'data exchange', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease diagnosis', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'web site']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,U01,2021,1553260
"A device to prevent Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) Project Summary/Abstract Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in epilepsy children and otherwise healthy adult epilepsy patients, with a cumulative lifetime risk of ~8%. About 70% of SUDEP occurs during sleep, and nearly 90% are found in the prone (face-down) position. SUDEP can likely be prevented by the simple intervention of repositioning and stimulating the patient after a convulsive seizure. Such intervention must be performed quickly and autonomously within a critical 3-minute window after a convulsion. Soterya, Inc., founded with the mission to develop technologies to decrease the risk of SUDEP, addresses this critical unmet medical need with an innovative smart mattress, the KORUS. Soterya has demonstrated feasibility by developing a functional alpha prototype consisting of an array of expandable cells and a shapeable surface that safely and rapidly repositions human subjects. There are currently no products that detects the prone position and physically repositions a patient into a recovery (sideways) position. The goal of this Phase I SBIR is to develop and validate two key technologies required to successfully develop a fully functional autonomous prototype: 1) advanced expandable cell with the size, weight, safety features, and noise management suitable for a human clinical trial, while maintaining our benchmark of generating enough lift at a required velocity with a 1000 lb/cell capacity; 2) embedded sensor system for rapid detection of body position change, and detection of the prone position. Soterya will optimize sensor manufacturing capabilities and software tools for body positioning visualization and data processing, and develop software for integrating these tools into a single sensory network system. Human feasibility testing will be performed through our academic partners at the epilepsy and sleep medicine service of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. A total of 10 normative control subjects will be recruited to test the device efficacy in repositioning, awake testing to assess detection of body position changes, and overnight testing for detecting spontaneous body position changes during sleep. Milestones for this study will be 1) safely repositioning subjects from a prone to a recovery position within 30 seconds; 2) detecting body position changes into a prone position with 95% accuracy. The completion of this project will position Soterya for the development of a fully functional prototype. A subsequent Phase 2 study will pair the KORUS with a commercial seizure detection device for a clinical trial in the hospital epilepsy monitoring unit, with the ultimate goal of developing a fully embedded seizure detection and management system. The development of KORUS as a medical device for the night-time management of convulsive seizures will achieve a 50-75% risk reduction of night-time SUDEP. Project Narrative Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in young patients with epilepsy that typically occurs during sleep and in prone (face-down) position after a convulsion. The goal of this project is to develop the advanced expandable cell and sensor system that are key parts in developing a smart mattress. We expect an autonomous body repositioning smart mattress-KORUS will prevent the prone position after a seizure and significantly decrease the risk of night-time SUDEP by 50-75%.",A device to prevent Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP),10323597,R43NS120394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Aluminum', 'Applications Grants', 'Arousal', 'Asphyxia', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Size', 'Cells', 'Central Sleep Apnea', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Convulsions', 'Custom', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Home', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Lifting', 'Mattresses', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motor Seizures', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Noise', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prone Position', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Rubber', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Shark', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Supervision', 'Supination', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'body position', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'engineering design', 'feasibility testing', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lifetime risk', 'manufacturing process', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'post stroke', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'software development', 'sudden unexpected death in epilepsy', 'support vector machine', 'tool']",NINDS,"SOTERYA, INC.",R43,2021,502561
"Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior Implantable devices are playing a greater role in neurologic care, but their effectiveness is limited, because they are blind to human thoughts, feelings, and behavior – factors that most dramatically affect our health. Coupling peripheral sensors to implants might help, but wouldn’t it be easier if the devices just asked us? Armed with this knowledge, next generation machines will more effectively drive neural activity in the brain to healthy states. They will also quickly learn behaviors that worsen health and guide us to better choices. Though DARPA, the NIH, and Neuralink are spending millions of dollars on new hardware for brain-computer interfaces, none focus on reciprocal, natural communication between host and machine. There is a desperate need for novel, practical methods that enable devices to learn from and guide human behavior.  In this application I propose to develop a new generation of autonomous brain-machine interfaces – devices that can question, record, act - and combine learning algorithms applied to neurosignals with teaching by their human hosts. Life with these implants will entail a subtle human- machine dialogue in which devices and humans teach and learn from each other. Humans will inform intelligent algorithms about what we are doing and feeling, while machines will incorporate this information into therapy and guide us to optimize quality of life in personalized ways. This is a paradigm shift from today’s simple devices, which are programmed by physicians during occasional office visits. I propose to demonstrate this paradigm in a practical, scalable way using current epilepsy implants that is rapidly translatable to many neurological disorders.  To achieve this goal, I will meld several cutting-edge technologies in novel ways, including: (1) State-of-the-art, high bandwidth implantables that sample neural activity, link to vast cloud- based computational power to process it, and intervene to modulate brain, spinal cord or peripheral neural activity. This work utilizes my experience from the past 20 years; (2) I will deploy powerful new computer science tools in novel ways. I will use convolutional neural nets (a.k.a. Deep Learning) to learn patterns from vast streams of continuous high-bandwidth neural data, build a two way human-machine interface using Natural Language Processing (NLP)., and probe networks with changes in human behavior and electrical stimulation and guide interventions toward therapeutic goals using Reinforcement Learning. Combining these computer science, machine learning techniques and measurements of human behavior is a new area of investigation for me that will leverage my unique background in clinical neurology and engineering to build a new class of interactive, human therapeutic devices. The goal of this project is to develop a revolutionary, new generation of implantable neurodevices that will communicate with, learn from, and teach their human hosts to better treat disease. Current implantable devices are blind to human actions, thoughts and behavior, which limits their effectiveness. State of the art computer techniques that can measure behavior and link them to brain activity will empower patients to teach, control and learn from their devices to improve health and quality of life.","Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior",10267167,DP1NS122038,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Feeling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Office Visits', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Work', 'blind', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'cloud based', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learned behavior', 'learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,DP1,2021,1137500
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI.

"WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild Project Summary Behavioral interventions for weight loss include self-monitoring and self-report of diet. However, few people adhere to self-monitoring because they believe it will be a burden. For those who do adhere, biased reporting leads to poor accuracy. Self-report measures have helped us understand contextual factors of problematic eating behaviors, but we cannot validate such relationships to dietary intake and weight because of unreliable reporting. Therefore, we need an objective way to validate self-report measures. Automated self-monitoring, however, can lead to high eating false alarm detection rates (calling something eating when it is not eating). It also requires participants to push buttons during the start and end of a meal. Passive and unobtrusive ways to capture images of food intake would improve accuracy of detection, avoid the need for a person to remember what they ate, and limit bias based on what participants believe to be socially desirable. Such methods could also ease the self-monitoring burden, decrease errors associated with self- report measures, and lay the foundation for understanding when and how problematic eating behaviors occur. Image capture using wearable cameras may help us better understand obesity and its context (that is, the situation in which eating occurs). However, privacy and ethical concerns of bystanders whose images are taken are a significant barrier. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that participants are both willing to wear and that provides meaningful information on food intake and context associated with problematic eating behaviors. Several methods exist, known as obfuscation, that can filter unnecessary information in the scene. However, we do not know which method is most acceptable to a person wearing the device in everyday life that would encourage greatest wear-time. Our project aims to determine which method is best for preserving privacy while providing enough information to understand eating behaviors and their context. To do this, we will observe participants in their everyday life, with special attention to eating behaviors. We will use these new image capture techniques to help understand eating behaviors associated with obesity. First, we will select the best obfuscation method by testing the most well-known obfuscation methods in a cross-over trial to identify which method has the greatest participant acceptability and feasibility (compared with no obfuscation). We will test a novel wearable camera with an infrared sensor (allows us to determine objects that are near vs. far in the camera) with 3 obfuscation methods in real-world settings, including a cartooning gaming–based method. We will then select the obfuscation method that increases wear time and design an eating algorithm around it. Using this algorithm we will assess our ability to capture behaviorally meaningful context from the obfuscated image, such as whether people are eating alone or not, at home, using screen time, and eating prepared or cooked food. This will improve current research practices of evaluating dietary intake and pave the way for personalized interventions in behavioral medicine. Project Narrative Obesity treatment would benefit greatly from an accurate understanding of problematic eating behaviors in real-world settings. Wearable video cameras provide significant utility in understanding eating behaviors, yet pose a major privacy concern in the real-world, significantly impacting longitudinal wear time. We are testing a privacy-conscious wearable device that individuals with obesity will wear and that can accurately detect eating, which will advance our understanding of behavioral phenotypes surrounding obesity, laying the foundation for future interventions to change problematic eating behaviors.",WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild,10109884,R03DK127128,"['Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Cartoons', 'Chest', 'Clinical Research', 'Conscious', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food', 'Food Patterns', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Home', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population Research', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Reading', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Social Desirability', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'adult obesity', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'contextual factors', 'cooking', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'experience', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized intervention', 'preservation', 'privacy preservation', 'sensor', 'tv watching', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'weight loss intervention', 'willingness']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2021,116737
"Next generation axonal quantification and classification using AI Abstract This Lab to Marketplace project describes the development of HyperAxon™, highly innovative software for performing automated segmentation, tracing, reconstruction and quantitative analysis of all axonal fibers visible in three-dimensional (3D) microscopic images of central nervous system (CNS) areas, even those with extremely high axonal fiber density. Accurate and rigorous analysis of all axonal fibers visible in 3D microscopic images of CNS tissue of non-transgenic and transgenic animal models as well as in human post mortem CNS tissue holds the promise of novel insights into physiological neural network connectivity patterns as well as into the neuropathological underpinnings of alterations in connectivity associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. However, this cannot be achieved with contemporary, computer-assisted tracing and reconstruction methods, which currently are the gold standard for investigating axonal fibers, because these methods primarily address tracing and reconstruction of only a limited number of individual axonal fibers. HyperAxon will be based on the highly innovative artificial intelligence technology Learning-based Tracing of Dense Axonal Fibers (LTDAF) that was recently developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL) (Lexington, MA). This project will build upon the original, lab-built LTDAF technology to create commercial software for wide- spread dissemination of this important new technology. Dissemination of this technology via a Lab to Marketplace commercial product is consistent with NIMH goals and will result in the technology having a significant impact on neuroscience research. The game-changing innovation in HyperAxon is the ability to automatically (i) segment, trace and reconstruct all axonal fibers visible in 3D microscopic images of CNS areas with high axonal fiber density, (ii) identify axonal branch points, (iii) resolve axonal fibers of passage from axonal fibers that make presumptive synapses in target regions, (iv) identify axonal fibers showing acute axonal injury and (v) precisely quantify alterations in number and density of axonal fibers in CNS tissue. Based on published pilot work performed at MIT LL, we are convinced that HyperAxon will be impactful in the field of neuroscience research and will enable substantial advancements in research on alterations in CNS circuitry associated with neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. Ultimately, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for a wide spectrum of complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will demonstrate feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software; work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of HyperAxon for commercial release. We will perform extensive feasibility studies, product validation and usability studies of HyperAxon in close collaboration with MIT LL and our academic collaboration partners. A competing technology is not available. Narrative Accurate and rigorous analysis of all visible axonal fibers in 3D microscopic images of central nervous system (CNS) tissue of non-transgenic and transgenic animal models as well as in human postmortem CNS tissue holds the promise of novel insights into physiological neural network connectivity patterns as well as into the neuropathological underpinnings of alterations in connectivity associated with human neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. Our proposed product will be a transformative technology, using a number of technical innovations that, for the first time, will enable researchers to perform such studies automatically and in a comprehensive manner. This system will allow researchers to make new discoveries based on new studies that are currently not feasible, ultimately providing the basis for developing novel treatments to prevent and fight complex brain diseases.",Next generation axonal quantification and classification using AI,10324805,R43MH128076,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain Diseases', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Validation', 'Work', 'automated segmentation', 'axon injury', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'density', 'fighting', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'terabyte', 'treatment strategy', 'usability']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R43,2021,449817
"An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine Project Summary  This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities. To illustrate our technology’s transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is central to the CF treatment.  Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and β- hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride, pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile (which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat readings.  In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to non-invasively track the target nutrients’ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first measure the sweat and blood analytes’ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring capabilities rendered by our solution.  The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine. Project Narrative This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable sweat bioanalytical technology— equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities—that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. By deploying this technology in clinical studies (with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), we will study and establish the correlation of the sweat readings to the circulating analytes and in response to nutritional interventions. This technology will provide a comprehensive and physiologically rich view of the individuals’ well-being/disease and nutritional status, rendering a personalized solution for effective treatment and nutritional support.","An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine",10198604,R21DK128711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Engineering', 'General Population', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Hour', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Inherited', 'Intake', 'Iontophoresis', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Support', 'Nutritional status', 'Periodicity', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reading', 'Sampling', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Study Subject', 'Sweat Glands', 'Sweat test', 'System', 'Technology', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'dietary supplements', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microsensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'precision nutrition', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'remote patient monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,210796

Flares are frequent, occurring in at least 30% of patients per year, and are associated with morbidity and impaired quality of life. Current methods to identify and predict flare are suboptimal and limited. If flares can be identified earlier and predicted strategies for mitigation or prevent could be instituted. Advances in digital and wearable technology allow for collection of continuous, non-invasive physiological parameters potentially linked with disease activity. Therefore, our specific aims are to (1) To determine the association of physiological metrics, including HRV, with symptomatic flare in UC, (2) To assess the predictive ability of physiological metrics, with a focus on HRV, for the development of symptomatic flare in UC, (3) Determine the feasibility, acceptability, and effect size of a HRV biofeedback intervention in subjects with symptomatic UC. To accomplish this we will perform a longitudinal cohort study enrolling 160 subjects with UC in remission and follow them for 12 months or until flare, collecting physiological indices from a wearable device (Apple Watch) and survey metrics from a smart phone application. In addition, we will perform a HRV directed biofeedback intervention in 23 subjects with UC and symptomatic flare. The general approach and skills acquired during this award can be applied to future R01 grants aimed at building upon the findings from this work. There are not effective strategies to identify or predict flares of ulcerative colitis (UC), which are common and result in morbidity. We aim to identify and modify readily obtainable physiological metrics, focusing on autonomic nervous system function, to recognize flares early, predict their development and improve symptomatology. This will improve management of UC, its associated morbidity, and disease outcomes.",Digital Biomarkers of Ulcerative Colitis Flare,10283677,K23DK129835,"['Abdominal Cramps', 'Abdominal Pain', 'Affect', 'American', 'Apple watch', 'Area', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biofeedback', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Colon', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Defecation', 'Development', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feces', 'Flare', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention approach', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Rectum', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'career', 'career development', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'compliance behavior', 'digital', 'digital health', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'mobile application', 'model development', 'news', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'symptomatic improvement', 'symptomatology', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K23,2021,162118
"EAT: A Reliable Eating Assessment Technology for Free-living Individuals. Project Summary/Abstract Overeating and unhealthy eating are often associated with various health risk conditions such as obesity, high blood pressure, and some chronic diseases. To get a better understanding of overeating and unhealthy eating, researchers often rely on self-reports provided by individuals. Suggestions regarding changing lifestyle is often provided based on observations from these self-reports. However, it is well known that self-reports can be erroneous and subject to reporting biases. Thus, an objective way to measure the eating activity and validating self-reports is necessary. Recently, there has been growing interest in moving beyond self-reports and monitoring the eating activity automatically. To monitor automatically, and in real time, researchers have looked at using sensor data from wrist worn devices, neck-worn devices, or ear-worn devices to automatically detect eating. These devices often enable capturing the eating periods. However, these devices seldom capture images, thus limiting the possibility of visually confirming the consumed food and their quantity. With the increasing popularity of wearable cameras, it is gradually becoming possible to capture the eating activities and associated context automatically and without any user intervention. Advances in machine learning enables automatically extracting eating related information from these captured images. However, wearable cameras often capture more information than necessary, like capturing bystanders. This unnecessary information capturing reduces participant's willingness to wearing the camera. Currently, no camera exists that can capture the eating activity and at the same time limit capturing unnecessary information. Obfuscating the unnecessary information might increase participant's willingness to wear the camera. However, it is unclear if and which obfuscation technique will increase participant's willingness to don the wearable camera and at the same time ensure automatic context determination. In this project, we will determine the possibility of using machine learning to detect eating in videos and identify the obfuscation technique that can allow detecting the eating activity without collecting unnecessary information. To this end, first we will develop an activity detection algorithm that will allow detecting the eating activity using data from an IR sensor array and RGB images. Next, we will test various obfuscation methods in a cross-over trial and select the best obfuscation method based on the greatest participant acceptability. We will then deploy the eating detection algorithm with the best obfuscation approach on a novel wearable camera that has an infrared sensor array. We will use this camera to test the possibility of detecting eating in a real-world setting. To validate our algorithm, we will ask people to confirm or refute predicted eating and non-eating moments. We will compare the performance of this algorithm against both real-time user response and 24-hour dietary recall to objectively evaluate the algorithm's performance. Our proposed system will improve current research practices of evaluating dietary intake and pave the way for personalized interventions for behavioral medicine. Project Narrative Monitoring an individual's eating behavior will provide detailed understanding of the causal relationship between the eating activity and conditions such as problematic eating and obesity. Manual self-reports are often erroneous and biased. The availability of wearable video cameras makes it possible to objectively capture the eating activity. However, manually observing video frames to obtain the objective measure of eating is burdensome. Additionally, wearable video cameras pose privacy concerns in real-world settings. To overcome these challenges, we are developing an automated eating detection system to monitor real-time eating behavior via a privacy-conscious wearable device that individuals will wear. We will confirm eating activities in real time. Such automatic and privacy-conscious real-time eating detection will allow us to advance our understanding of the eating activity, laying the foundation for future interventions to change problematic eating behaviors.",EAT: A Reliable Eating Assessment Technology for Free-living Individuals.,10280789,R01DK129843,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Bite', 'Body mass index', 'Calories', 'Cartoons', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Conscious', 'Controlled Environment', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crystalline Lens', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Ear', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Feeling', 'Female', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Surrogate Markers', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'cohort', 'detection platform', 'dietary', 'emotional eating', 'experimental study', 'food consumption', 'hedonic', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'smart watch', 'social', 'tv watching', 'wearable device', 'willingness']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,701652
"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis.

"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes.

"Proteomic Analysis of Blood Plasma using High Throughput Sequencers Abstract  Aptamers made from DNA, RNA and other nucleic acids that have chemical modifications can be engineered to bind tightly to biomolecules like the proteins that circulate in blood.  The primary goal of this project is to develop a kit of aptamer reagents to enable simultaneous measurement of protein abundance profiles, focusing especially on significant differentially abundant proteins in blood. This will aid in cancer diagnostics and in monitoring protein populations over the course of disease and therapeutic intervention. The intended product is an Aptamer Proteomics kit (AP-kit) that can be used by researchers and clinicians to comprehensively profile the differences between healthy individuals and those afflicted with cancer. The kits will be validated in-house and tested with carefully curated samples focused on prostate cancer.  The AP-kits will give cancer scientists new tools that lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of cancer types and to create new and more effective treatments and preventions. Physicians will be enabled to diagnose tumors earlier, reducing the burden of radiation treatments and chemotherapy on cancer patients. AP-assays will aid in monitoring the progress of cancer therapies and allow treatments to be customized for individual patients. These outcomes will increase quality of life and substantially decrease the burden of cancer on society.

"A Hand-held, Portable Robotic Device for Automated Venipuncture. Abstract Venipuncture, the process of obtaining intravenous access for either catheter placements or blood sampling, is one of the most standard clinical procedure performed worldwide. It is also the leading cause of both patient and practitioner injury in healthcare facilities. This is because successfully identifying and cannulating veins relies heavily on clinician expertise and patient physiology, where non-visible, non-palpable, or rolling veins create challenges for clinicians to quickly and safely obtain venous access. My thesis project is involved with the development of an ultrasound image-guided hand-held device for safely and efficiently obtaining venous access in patients. The device works by using ultrasound imaging to identify vessels for cannulation in order to robotically guide an attached needle safely to the vein center, all comprised within a hand-held, easy to use portable device. The proposed research here involves the development of the hand-held device, including 1) development of a puncture prediction software for assuring first-stick accuracy and 2) development of the hand-held robotic device for portable use and performing catheter insertions. The outcome of this work will be the groundwork for a hand- held automated venipuncture device for safe, quick, and simple venous access. Our hypothesis is that a device utilizing ultrasound image guidance and robotic needle placement will increase first-stick accuracy and safety for patients while simplifying the entire venipuncture process and reducing procedure time for clinicians. Project Narrative One of the most common medical practices in healthcare facilities are blood draws and IV catheter insertions. However, failed venipunctures and injuries to patients happen frequently because of how difficult it is for clinicians to find veins and accurately insert the needle. We are developing a hand-held, robotic venipuncture device to assist doctors and clinicians to simply, quickly, and safely obtain venous access in any difficult situations.","A Hand-held, Portable Robotic Device for Automated Venipuncture.",10461711,F31HL149219,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cannulations', 'Catheters', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Needles', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Puncture procedure', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Severities', 'Stream', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Veins', 'Venipunctures', 'Venous', 'Work', 'arm', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'detection platform', 'experience', 'eye hand coordination', 'force feedback', 'human data', 'human study', 'image guided', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'robotic device', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'success']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",F31,2021,35045
"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user.

"Monitoring mosquito eco-systems and vector-control strategies using a stand-off optical sensor. Monitoring mosquito ecosystems and vector-control strategies using a stand-off optical sensor.  PI: B. Thomas – NIH R21 Project Summary:  Vector control strategies remain one of the most effective ways to protect human populations from the large number of mosquito borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, zika virus, or West Nile virus. Mosquito populations are generally monitored using physical traps, however this method suffers from many disadvantages. It requires long and expensive laboratory analysis by qualified personnel which drastically reduces the number of observed insects as well as time of trap deployment. Traps also provide a poor estimate of the actual population size or population density because the attractive range of traps is generally unknown and may change with weather conditions. These limitations are strong drawbacks in our ability to evaluate the effectiveness of various types of vector-control strategies (chemicals, biological, environmental modifications etc.). Inferior methods are not necessarily identified which ultimately contributes to the spread of infectious diseases. In this context, we argue that new methodologies to monitor insect population dynamics is key in the necessary effort to improve control program performance.  A team from the New Jersey Institute of Technology in collaboration with the Hudson Mosquito Program seeks support to carry out a series of field experiments using a new optical sensor capable of identifying in real-time the family, species, and gender of mosquitoes in its field of view. The laser-based instrument is a dual-wavelength polarization-sensitive stand-off sensor. For each flying insect transiting through the infrared laser beams, the sensor can retrieve the optical properties of the wings and body of the insect as well as its wing beat frequency. Preliminary data from a laboratory prototype and numerical simulations indicate that the instrument, using a supervised machine learning classifier, can identify the species, gender, and gravidity of mosquitoes up to 300 m away. The instrument will be deployed in a high mosquito density area in New Jersey to continuously monitor the mosquito population over the whole season from April to October 2021. Continuous measurements will allow to identify a number of insects that is orders a magnitude higher than physical traps. As the probed volume of air is known, data analysis will provide the population density for each class of insects from which the population dynamics will be derived. In addition, the time and date of each insect transit allow to study the circadian rhythm, peak activities, and behavior as a function of atmospheric conditions measured by a weather station. In 2022, a similar experiment will be conducted at the same location while the Hudson Mosquito Program will conduct a vector control campaign targeting Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, both responsible for the spread of various infectious diseases. The impact of multiple applications of airborne pyrethroid insecticide on targeted and non-targeted insects will be evaluated by studying the mortality rates and population dynamics for each species. Both years, the data will be compared to physical traps on site, the current gold standard method, for further analysis and validation. Project Narrative  Mosquito-borne diseases are a major challenge for Human health as they affect nearly 700 million people every year and result in close to one million deaths; however, lack of reliable data on mosquito populations has become a serious obstacle to evaluate the effectiveness of vector control programs. The proposed study will make use of a new methodology based on applied optics to remotely count and identify in real-time the species and sex group of flying mosquitoes in their natural habitat. This novel methodology will be used to evaluate the impact of insecticide applications on the population dynamics of key vector of infectious diseases.",Monitoring mosquito eco-systems and vector-control strategies using a stand-off optical sensor.,10215105,R21AI153732,"['Aedes', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Controlled Environment', 'Culex (Genus)', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dengue Fever', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Female', 'Flying body movement', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Gold', 'Gravidity', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Inferior', 'Insecta', 'Insecticides', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mosquito-borne infectious disease', 'New Jersey', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Sizes', 'Price', 'Property', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Seasons', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Weather', 'West Nile virus', 'Wing', 'Zika Virus', 'atmospheric conditions', 'base', 'density', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy evaluation', 'egg', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning classifier', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optical sensor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'pyrethroid', 'rate of change', 'sensor', 'sex', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'vector', 'vector control', 'weather stations']",NIAID,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2021,187106
"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR .

"Ultrasound clutter and noise improvements applied to echocardiographic left atrial appendage visualization Summary  Ultrasonic imaging is the most widely used advanced imaging modality in the United States, and excluding planar radiography, it represents 44% of all imaging studies. Unfortunately, ultrasound images are often subopti- mal, and some echocardiography studies show degradation in up to 98% of patients. This rate of degradation and the freehand nature of clinical ultrasound means that image quality is more dependent on operator skill than other advanced modalities, but even with the most skilled practitioners, ultrasound completely fails in 11-64% of clinical tasks. Our overall goal for this application is to fundamentally decrease ultrasound failure rates. Low-quality ultrasound is particularly problematic in echocardiography because of its role as a ﬁrst-line tool for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac disease. When transthoracic echo is inadequate more costly and time-consuming exams like transesophageal echo or MRI are required. To (1) facilitate the high volumes of transthoracic echo, (2) im- prove patient comfort and safety (i.e. reduce transesophageal echo), (3) reduce cost and procedure time, and (4) maximize physician efﬁciency, it is crucial to have consistently high quality transthoracic echo. To provide this, we introduce new acquisition and reconstruction solutions for ultrasound imaging.  Echocardiographic imaging of the left atrial appendage is growing in importance in lockstep with the rising incidence of atrial ﬁbrillation, which currently effects as many as 2-6 million Americans and is expected to grow to 6-12 million by 2050. In patients with atrial ﬁbrillation, thrombus may appear in as many as 12-26% of left atria with most appearing in the appendage. Therefore, in patients with current atrial ﬁbrillation the left atrial appendage must be screened with echocardiography for thrombus before cardioversion can be performed to return the heart to sinus rhythm. Further, patients receiving a left atrial appendage closure device due to chronic atrial ﬁbrillation require annual transesophageal echo follow ups to monitor the device. For both cases, the gold- standard and standard-of-care is transesophageal echocardiography, and while the left atrial appendage can be visualized transthoracically, is is rarely used because the image quality is considered too unreliable.  Ultrasound image quality is degraded by both clutter and thermal noise, so to make clinically transforma- tional improvements to ultrasound–and echocardiography speciﬁcally–it is necessary to address both the clutter problem and the noise problem. Addressing both of these issues is becoming increasingly important because recent developments in beamforming have focused on non-linear algorithms (including deep networks), and the performance of these methods are more strongly linked to the noise level compared to conventional beamforming methods. To this end, we introduce both a solution enhancing signal-to-noise ratio using coded excitation and a comprehensive solution for clutter reduction using deep network beamforming. Project Narrative  Ultrasound is the most utilized imaging modality, and echocardiography itself accounts for nearly a ﬁfth of all imaging exams. Unfortunately, for many diagnostic tasks, ultrasound exams are suboptimal or fail altogether. To resolve this, we introduce a new framework for both coded excitation and deep network beamforming and evaluate our methods in the context of transthoracic echocardiography of the left atrial appendage.",Ultrasound clutter and noise improvements applied to echocardiographic left atrial appendage visualization,10299361,R01HL156034,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Echocardiography', 'Electric Countershock', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Left', 'Left atrial structure', 'Length', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sinus', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transesophageal Echocardiography', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'appendage', 'auricular appendage', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'monitoring device', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'second harmonic', 'skills', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,649155
"Rapid platelet dysfunction detection in whole blood samples using machine learning powered micro-clot imaging. Abstract This project will optimize a point-of-care (POC) platelet force monitoring technology for clinical application in trauma care. The leading causes of death and disability after trauma are related to hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Platelets are critical to hemostasis by inducing clot formation via adhesion, aggregation, and contraction at wounds. Platelets often become dysfunctional after trauma which worsens internal bleeding and ICH progression and increasing morbidity. POC platelet assays have not been incorporated in practice due to:1) lack of large cohort ED patient testing; 2) poor accuracy in transfusion prediction and 3) extended processing times. We have made an innovative POC technology to test platelet function by directly measuring platelet contractile forces on microfluidic force sensors. Advantages of our POC test vs. existing assays: 1) rapid, direct activation and measures of platelet functions and 2) innovative machine vision with deep potential for machine learning insight. However, this technology needs optimization and validation in a large major ED trauma cohort and remains untested after ICH. Our pilot data suggests platelet contractile forces are sensitive to a range of relevant activation pathways and mechanisms and force is significantly decreased in trauma patients requiring blood transfusion. Further, in prior clinical trials, platelet transfusion has been found to be harmful when used indiscriminately. Building on this unmet scientific need, we will determine if our POC technology is predictive of hemorrhagic complications in trauma patients, informing a personalized transfusion strategy. Our overarching hypothesis is our POC platelet force monitor technology is an efficient indicator of bleeding complications after trauma and ICH. Aim 1: Optimize the platelet force monitor optics to improve platelet force sensor performance. We hypothesize the addition of a second fluorescent imaging channel can improve our current platelet force sensor performance. Aim 2: Use machine learning (ML) image analysis to improve detection of platelet dysfunction and prediction of trauma outcomes. We hypothesize image-based ML models can improve test performance. We will compare the accuracy of direct platelet force measurements (Aim 1) vs. ML-enhancement measurements for detecting platelet dysfunction and predicting outcomes. Aim 3: Validate our platelet function algorithm for predicting blood transfusion needs, mortality, and the progression of traumatic ICH in a prospective cohort of severely-injured ED trauma patients. We hypothesize platelet force will be a powerful predictor of blood transfusion needs, mortality, and progression of ICH. In the ED we will apply our algorithm (both the original and optimized algorithm from Aim 1) to blood from trauma patients and compare the predicted transfusion requirements against actual transfusion (Aim-3a) and measure the association between measured platelet force and ICH progression (Aim-3b). Project Narrative Rapidly identifying patients who are at risk for traumatic internal and intracranial bleeding would improve care by enabling personalized transfusion strategies. The current clinical approach causes undue morbidity and mortality because of late identification of those in need of a transfusion, resulting in delayed blood transfusion in those patients who would benefit, and unnecessary transfusions in those who would not. The proposed project improves and validates an innovative blood testing technology which has shown the potential to make rapid bleeding assessment of every patient both easy and accurate.",Rapid platelet dysfunction detection in whole blood samples using machine learning powered micro-clot imaging.,10146213,R61HL156508,"['ADP Receptors', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Arachidonic Acids', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Electrons', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Platelet Function Tests', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Point of Care Technology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Prospective cohort', 'Receptor Inhibition', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Traumatic intracranial hemorrhage', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'blood product', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic technologies', 'disability', 'flexibility', 'fluorescence imaging', 'force sensor', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'microsensor', 'mortality', 'nanonewton', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'platelet function', 'point of care', 'point of care testing', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'seal', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'shear stress', 'trauma care', 'wound']",NHLBI,STASYS MEDICAL CORPORATION,R61,2021,294185
"Quantitative histopathology for cancer prognosis using quantitative phase imaging on stained tissues Summary Fast, accurate, and scalable testing has been recognized unanimously as crucial for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and future pandemics. We propose a technology that allows rapid (~2 minutes) testing for SARS CoV-2. Our technology combines novel label-free imaging and dedicated deep-learning algorithms to detect and classify viral populations in exhaled air. If successful, this project will result in a device based on quantitative phase imaging and integrated AI tools, which will detect the unlabeled virus acquired by the patient’s breath condensed on a microscope slide. Toward this goal, we will advance Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM), an ultrasensitive label-free imaging technique, proven to measure structures down to the sub-nanometer scale. SLIM was developed in the PI’s Lab at UIUC, its original publication received 490 citations to date, and has been commercialized by Phi Optics (Research Park, UIUC), with sales across the world in both academia and industry. Applying the computed fluorescence maps back to the QPI data, we propose to measure nanoscale features of viral particles, with high specificity, minimal preparation time, and independent of clinical infrastructure. As a result, the new technology will eventually be ideal for point-of-care settings, surveillance screening and as a home monitoring device. We anticipate that our approach will be scalable to other viruses, with new imaging and training data. Narrative We propose a breath test using label-free imaging and AI: an individual exhales on a microscope slide, which is fed into a SLIM microscope equipped with a computer that runs deep-learning pre-trained algorithms for SARS CoV-2 identification.

"Clinical performance of hemodynamics-based non-invasive device for skin cancer testing Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the US, accounting for just under half of all diagnosed cancers (5+ million diagnoses), 27,000+ deaths each year and the annual treatment costs of over $8.1 billion. The early diagnosis of skin cancer has significant impact on patient outcomes and health care costs but remains highly subjective and requires highly specialized training while existing diagnostic devices offer low positive predictive value which results in both, missed skin cancers as well as a large number of unnecessary biopsies. When a patient presents with a suspicious skin lesion, uncertainty in the initial assessment by a dermatologist may lead to biopsies that suggest that no subsequent treatment is necessary (false positive - FP) while at the same time lesions that are not biopsied may warrant treatment (false negative - FN) potentially giving rise to claims of malpractice. FPs subject patients to unnecessary procedures and the health care system to unnecessary costs. FNs result in delayed treatment, compromising patient outcomes and increasing health care costs. This diagnostic problem is exacerbated when a patient first presents to a primary care practice due to lesser diagnostic performance. Here, some patients may be referred unnecessarily to dermatologists while other cases go undetected. The Veriskin’s TruScore device is a proprietary, non-invasive, low-cost, easy-to-use, hand-held unit that supports the diagnosis of skin cancer. It rapidly and objectively determines whether a suspicious skin lesion is cancerous, reducing the number of FNs and also reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies. The device provides a score of 0% to 100% indicating the probability of malignancy. The TruScore works by detecting and analyzing force-induced hemodynamic abnormalities due to pathological angiogenesis which is a well established early hallmark of cancer. Pilot clinical studies indicate >99% sensitivity and >94% specificity in differentiating of skin cancer from a variety of benign conditions. The device is useful at all levels of care, but the greatest benefits to patients may result when the device is used in primary care practice. The specific goal of this project is to test the device in a larger scale clinical study. The long-term goal of the project is to achieve widespread clinical adoption of this simple-to-use and low-cost non- invasive skin cancer diagnostic method and device that will (1) facilitate sensitive, specific and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin regions by general practice clinicians and nurse practitioners, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs. Project Narrative The lack of accurate, objective skin cancer assessment tool for frontline caregivers leads to preventable loss of lives and costs the US healthcare system over $8B each year.  VeriSkin device enables a low cost, non-invasive, easy-to-use skin cancer diagnostic method that will (1) facilitate accurate and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin lesions by general practice clinicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care resulting in reduction in both the number of missed skin cancers and the number of unneeded referrals to dermatologists and unnecessary biopsies, and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs.  The requested funds will be used to demonstrate the safety and the effectiveness of the device in a larger clinical study needed to enable regulatory approval of the device.",Clinical performance of hemodynamics-based non-invasive device for skin cancer testing,10127607,R44CA250768,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Assessment tool', 'Basal Cell', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Dermatologist', 'Detection', 'Device Approval', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Family Practice', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Practices', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hand functions', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intercellular Fluid', 'Internal Medicine', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malpractice', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Morphology', 'Neoplasms', 'Nevus', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Optics', 'Painless', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Neovascularization', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physician Assistants', 'Pigments', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Screening for Skin Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Uncertainty', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Vascular resistance', 'Work', 'absorption', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanical pressure', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'peace', 'pressure', 'provider behavior', 'response', 'safety testing', 'screening', 'skills', 'skin lesion', 'tumor', 'vascular abnormality']",NCI,"VERISKIN, INC.",R44,2021,833460
"Endoscope development for the clinical use of near infrared fluorescence molecular probes in the GI tract Minimally-invasive optical imaging is being advanced by molecular probes that enhance contrast using fluorescence. The applications in cancer imaging are very broad, ranging from early diagnosis of cancer to the guiding of interventions, such as biopsy. The high-sensitivity afforded by wide-field fluorescence imaging using scanning laser light is being developed for these broad applications. The platform technology is the SFE – Scanning Fiber Endoscope, which places a sub-1-mm scanner at the tip of a highly flexible shaft. Because several different laser wavelengths can be mixed and scanned together, full-color reflectance imaging will be combined with near infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging in a 4-channel multimodal SFE. The goal of this project is to develop a prototype VerAvanti 4-channel multimodal SFE (mmSFE) for a specific cancer imaging application that can have significant impact in early detection and endoscopic treatment of esophageal cancer. VerAvanti is a start-up company located in Redmond, Washington and is founded and staffed with engineering graduates from the University of Washington (UW), where the SFE was invented and tested in pilot clinical trials. VerAvanti has exclusive license to commercialize the SFE technology for medical imaging and a 3- channel full color SFE (using red, green, and blue reflectance) is already in pilot manufacturing and testing. This project will rapidly translate the 4-channel mmSFE technology into a specific product for fluorescently guiding endoscopic interventions in the GI tract. Furthermore, the VerAvanti mmSFE will be designed for efficient manufacturing in a modular format with reduced part numbers and expected lower cost. The application is using NIR fluorescence molecular probes that were developed at the University of Michigan (UM) that bind to high grade dysplasia (HGD) and neoplastic cells of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The mmSFE product is introduced through the working channel of a conventional endoscope to identify regions of the lower esophagus that are over-expressing EGFR and ErbB2, which are transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors that stimulate epithelial cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Overexpression of these targets reflects an increase in biological aggressiveness and higher risk for progression to Barrett's esophagus, HGD, and EAC. The design of the mmSFE diagnostic algorithm is based on the high correlation of the fluorescence lesion target-to-background measurement in collaboration with UW and UM. Additional mmSFE guided tools will be developed for more accurate endoscopic interventions using NIR fluorescence molecular probes. Both software and hardware will be fabricated and tested for the start of a multisite clinical trial using the mmSFE. The multimodal scanning fiber endoscope (mmSFE) technology was developed by the University of Washington, licensed to VerAvanti Inc., and now demonstrates feasibility for detecting early cancer of the esophagus in clinical testing at the University of Michigan using fluorescence molecular markers that bind to cancer cells. In this direct phase 2 SBIR project, VerAvanti will improve the fluorescence imaging performance of the prototype mmSFE system, support advanced imaging processing at the University of Washington, and design new interventional devices that provide direct visualization from an integrated mmSFE. The result of this project will be to provide a novel endoscope product to the University of Michigan and national leaders in the management of esophageal cancer for a future multisite clinical trial.",Endoscope development for the clinical use of near infrared fluorescence molecular probes in the GI tract,10325563,R44CA261318,"['Academic support', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophagus', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Eye', 'Fiber', 'Fluorescence', 'Forcep', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High grade dysplasia', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Localized Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Near-infrared optical imaging', 'Oncoproteins', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precancerous Conditions', 'Production', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Records', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sedation procedure', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visualization', 'Washington', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cell growth', 'clinical development', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'instrument', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'overexpression', 'premalignant', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'spectral distortion', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'usability']",NCI,"VERAVANTI, INC.",R44,2021,993178
"Diagnosis of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Low-Income Countries Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) causes more than 509,000 deaths per year worldwide, and over 80% of these cases occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In the settings where it is available and affordable, ESCC diagnosis is made using the highly invasive and expensive procedure known as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD, also referred to as upper endoscopy). However, citizens of underdeveloped countries often do not have widespread access to EGD; thus, there is a pressing need for easier, safer, cheaper, more accessible ESCC diagnostic strategies. We have developed a strategy based on our exciting preliminary data in ESCC patients: a swallowable, retrievable sponge-capsule device (EsophaCap) combined with a sensitive, specific DNA methylation biomarker panel (JHU patent pending) and machine learning classifiers. Capsulomics, Inc., a startup company from Johns Hopkins University, will commercialize this assay, termed “EsoCAN,” for ESCC diagnosis.  The goal of this project is to explore the feasibility and development of a non-endoscopic diagnostic test as a more convenient, inexpensive, and more widely usable alternative to EGD in LMICs. Ultimately, this test, when applied to at-risk populations, is likely to significantly improve survival and quality of life. As an initial step toward this goal, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1, analytical and clinical validation of quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) assays for 5 candidate loci: cg20655070, SLC35F1, TAC1, ZNF132, and ZNF542, including a pilot study of EsophaCap collected specimens from 50 ESCC patients and 70 controls, and Aim 2, creation of multivariate machine learning (ML) diagnostic biomarker models. In Phase II, we will further develop and evaluate our non-endoscopic diagnostic test in a larger patient cohort for accuracy of ESCC diagnosis in LMICs. Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer (ESCC) is a serious world-wide health problem with low survival levels. This STTR Phase I application details the development of a novel diagnostic assay to detect ESCC in low- to middle income countries, where the incidence and death rate from ESCC are considerably higher than in other nations.",Diagnosis of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Low-Income Countries,10325590,R41CA261376,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biotechnology', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Country', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Dyspepsia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endoscopy', 'Esophageal Neoplasms', 'Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Esophagitis', 'Esophagogastroduodenoscopy', 'Funding', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Genes', 'Genomic DNA', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-Malignant', 'Patients', 'Peptic Ulcer', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Populations at Risk', 'Porifera', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'TAC1 gene', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'candidate marker', 'capsule', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'esophageal squamous cell cancer', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'machine learning algorithm', 'methylation biomarker', 'mortality', 'non-smoker', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'prognostic assays', 'programs', 'random forest', 'success']",NCI,"CAPSULOMICS, LLC",R41,2021,399995
"DIGITAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS FOR COVID-19: PERSONALIZED ANALYTICS WEARABLE BIOSENSOR PLATFORM FOR EARLY DETECTION OF COVID-19 DECOMPENSATION The goal of this project is to develop an artificial intelligence-based data analytics and cloud computing platform, paired with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared wearable devices, to create a personalized baseline index that could indicate a change in health status for patients who have tested COVID-19 positive.  The project involves the development and validation of a COVID-19 Decompensation Index (CDI) that builds off physIQ’s existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics platform.  Data will be collected from 400 human subjects that are both pre-hospitalization subjects (found to be positive for COVID-19) and subjects that have been hospitalized and treated for COVID and then discharged.  This combined population will consist of COVID-19 decompensation cases (event cases) and cases for which COVID-19 did not result in any kind of decompensation (non-event cases).  The 400-patient dataset will be partitioned into a training subset and a testing subset.  Performance will be assessed using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) as the metric of performance.  Data collected under this project will be deidentified and securely transmitted to an NIH data hub. n/a",DIGITAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS FOR COVID-19: PERSONALIZED ANALYTICS WEARABLE BIOSENSOR PLATFORM FOR EARLY DETECTION OF COVID-19 DECOMPENSATION,10329863,5N91020C00040,"['Area Under Curve', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 early detection', 'Cloud Computing', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Hospitalization', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Secure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'computational platform', 'coronavirus disease', 'data hub', 'digital health', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,"VGBIO, INC.",N01,2021,4338693

"TOPIC 427 - De-Identification Software Tools and Pipelines for Cancer Imaging Research This proposal has three main objectives. Firstly, to identify actual and potential PHI/PII locations in DICOM and WSI data - both tags in the header data and coordinates in the image data, including manufacturer specific data - and to deliver a detailed, broad-based landscape analysis report. Secondly, to deliver a robust, validatable software solution that facilitates the development, management, chaining, and execution of medical image data de-identification algorithms. For Phase I, we will implement data de-identification pipelines using as a baseline the data elements identified in the landscape analysis report. Thirdly, to develop, on the same software platform, a set of deep learning-based algorithms to perform image data deidentification. We will facilitate the execution of these algorithms against data both local and remote, in order to obviate any security concerns regarding having to move data to the cloud for de-identification - i.e., we will ""bring the algorithms to the data"". Our cloud-based solution, EICON REACH (Remote Execution of Algorithms for Clinical Health), provides the underpinning for this proposal. We will enhance its capabilities to address directly the objectives listed. At the end of Phase I, we will provide these capabilities in a fully tested, fully documented, validated solution with full audit trail of user actions and data transformations. EICON REACH can also serve as the basis for a Phase II proposal wherein we would undertake a broader and deeper effort to address the more complex issues related to identification, review and redaction of PHI in the image data. n/a",TOPIC 427 - De-Identification Software Tools and Pipelines for Cancer Imaging Research,10496719,5N91021C00042,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Location', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Imaging', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Security', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cloud based', 'data de-identification', 'deep learning']",NCI,IMPACT BUSINESS INFORMATION SOLUTIONS INC.,N43,2021,398120
