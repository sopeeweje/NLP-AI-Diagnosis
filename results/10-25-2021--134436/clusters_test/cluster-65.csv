"Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to continue development of a novel approach based on deep learning neural networks to encode molecules into chemically rich vectors. In Phase 1 we demonstrated that this representation enables computational models that more accurately predict the chemical properties of molecules than state-of-the-art models, yet are also far simpler to build because they do not require any expert decisions or optimization to achieve high performance. In Phase 2 we will exploit this unprecedented simplicity to develop an intuitive software package that will for the first time enable any chemist or biologist working in drug discovery to create and run their own predictive models – without relying on specialized cheminformatics expertise – yet still achieve or exceed the accuracy of the best currently available techniques. Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  We also plan to take the technology one step further, leveraging our chemically rich vector representation to enable the software to creatively suggest novel compounds (which do not appear in the training libraries, screening libraries, or lead series) that outperform the lead candidates simultaneously on bioactivity, ADME/Tox and PK assays . Solving this inverse problem is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry and has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. !",Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts,10133177,R44TR002527,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Solubility', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'chemical property', 'cheminformatics', 'computational chemistry', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'learning strategy', 'melting', 'model building', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'vector', 'voice recognition']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2021,749928
"A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19 Project Summary  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented societal suffering and economic disruption. In the United States, more than six million people have contracted COVID-19 and more than one hundred ninety thousand patients have died of this disease to date. Although current COVID-19 diagnostic testing technologies are critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks, they are not practical for field use. Current diagnostic tests are cumbersome to perform because they use aqueous solutions, require multiple steps, and hours-to-days to obtain results. Since the US began to reopen the economy in May, there has been a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic approach that is non-invasive, portable, and can rapidly provide test results.  The overall goal of the project is to develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). The handheld tool will be a closed system for trapping select volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a microfabricated chip. The captured VOCs will be eluted with ethanol and then analyzed using a commercially available, portable GC-PID instrument. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms will be applied to recognize the VOC pattern that correlates with COVID-19 infection. The central innovation is the microfabricated chip that captures carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath and thus serves as a preconcentrator, which enables analysis of carbonyl VOCs by the portable GC-PID. The hypothesis is that the carbonyl metabolome in exhaled breath is directly related to the body’s reaction to the novel coronavirus infection, and changes in the carbonyl VOC composition in exhaled breath relative to healthy controls can be used to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.  Three specific aims are proposed to fulfill the overall goal. Aim 1 is to build a disposable handheld breath analyzer tool for concentrating carbonyl VOCs. Aim 2 is to identify VOC patterns in the breath of COVID-19 patients by machine learning algorithms. Aim 3 is to integrate portable GC technology with the breath sampling tool for COVID-19 screening guided by an AI system. The University of Louisville is uniquely suited to rapidly transition the microchip technology to field use because of the PI and Co-PI’s experience in breath analysis and translational research, and the project team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence as well as the state-of-the-art facilities that include a MicroNano Technology Center, Biosafety Level 3 Regional Biocontainment Lab, and an NIH-funded REACH program. 8. Project Narrative  This project will develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze the detected signals of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath by the portable GC for detection of COVID-19 patients. UofL is uniquely suited to develop this approach because of the PI’s expertise in breath analysis for detection of Tuberculosis and lung cancer and the team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence.",A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19,10266377,U18TR003787,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biometry', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 detection', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 screening', 'COVID-19 test', 'Cancer Detection', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Contracts', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Detection', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Ethanol', 'Exhalation', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Influenza', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Medical Device', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rapid screening', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Sterilization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vial device', 'Viral', 'Viral Respiratory Tract Infection', 'Virulent', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'adduct', 'aqueous', 'asymptomatic COVID-19', 'biosafety level 3 facility', 'bronchial epithelium', 'carbonyl compound', 'detection sensitivity', 'detector', 'experience', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'microchip', 'mobile computing', 'novel coronavirus', 'photoionization', 'point of care', 'portability', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reagent testing', 'symptomatic COVID-19', 'tool', 'virology', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,U18,2021,1026672
"Permeability Imaging using Simultaneous Dynamic PET and Arterial Spin Labeling MRI Abstract Candidate's Career Goals: Dr. Han has a strong background in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, image reconstruction and arterial spin labeling (ASL), with a Ph.D. in bio and brain engineering. Dr. Han is currently at a junior-faculty rank of instructor at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). His goal is to expand his future career to multi-modality positron emission tomography (PET)-MR imaging for translational research and clinical improvement. His long-term goal is to become an independent, accomplished investigator that can lead future scientific and clinical imaging projects taking full advantage of multi-modality PET-MR imaging. Career Development Plan: Foundational training in PET/PET-MR imaging as well as neurology is proposed for the candidate, an area that the candidate currently lacks knowledge and experience in. The candidate plans to engage in formal course work/seminars, research via one-on-one instructions with mentors and collaborators, conferences/presentations, manuscript/grant preparations, and teaching/leadership roles to grow as an independent investigator in the field of PET-MR imaging and neurology. Research Project: The overall goal of the proposed research is to take advantage of simultaneous dynamic PET and ASL-MR imaging to estimate the permeability surface product (PS) of the PET tracer, which is new physiological information that cannot be obtained with PET or MR alone. PS describes the unidirectional flux rate of macromolecules from the blood plasma into the interstitial space of cellular tissue and is the key metric for assessing the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Knowing the PS of the PET tracer provides powerful capability to probe the physiological delivery process of essential macromolecules involved in the pathogenesis of diseases in relation to BBB, due to the theoretically unlimiting potential in the design of radioactive analogs of important biological compounds. We plan to develop a PET tracer PS mapping method, achieve the first phantom and human study with PS mapping, and study the changes in the spatial distribution of tau neurofibrillary tangles (tau) and amyloid-beta (Aß) plaque depositions in relation to the BBB integrity changes with pathological events associated with the progression of AD, by performing dynamic-PET/mPLD-ASL studies using 18F-T807 and 11C- Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET tracers on AD and normal subjects. Environment: MGH provides an ideal setting for conducting research in MR, PET, and PET-MR imaging since multiple state-of-the-art imaging systems are available for preclinical/clinical MR scanners and preclinical simultaneous PET-MR scanners. There is a dynamic flow phantom designed to simulate blood flow for two compartment pharmacokinetics and an MR-compatible pump and detection system for continuous blood sampling suitable for performing ASL flow and PET imaging studies with arterial sampling. Also, there is a shared memory supercomputer ideal for the image reconstruction proposed in the project. MGH is also home to many experts in both PET-MR imaging and neurology who can provide their expertise to this project. Narrative The overall goal of the proposed research is to take advantage of simultaneous dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to estimate the permeability surface product (PS) of the PET tracer, which is new physiological information that cannot be obtained with PET or MR alone.

If successful, the proposed technique will allow the extraction of new physiological information, PS, while facilitating a new understanding of the relationships between BBB integrity, neurovascular function and proteinopathy in the etiology and progression of diseases such as AD.",Permeability Imaging using Simultaneous Dynamic PET and Arterial Spin Labeling MRI,10217132,K01EB030045,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Amino Acids', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood flow', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Instruction', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Permeability', 'Physiological', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Radial', 'Radioactive', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Senile Plaques', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spin Labels', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'analog', 'attenuation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical imaging', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detection platform', 'experience', 'human study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interstitial', 'macromolecule', 'multimodality', 'neurovascular', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'reconstruction', 'shared memory', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2021,124746
"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases. The developed tools and databases will be made available to all Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium (CF-MC) members and professional working groups. The WCMC will also provide guidance for compound identification to the National Metabolomics Data Repository. The broad dissemination of developed compound identification protocols, training for compound identification workflows, databases and distribution of internal reference standard kits for metabolomic standardization will overall widely support the metabolomics community. Project Narrative – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) Understanding metabolism is relevant to find both markers and mechanisms of diseases and health phenotypes, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer.

"Role of Epigenetically Active  Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are increasingly recognized as originating from dysregulation of early brain development, which represents a window of vulnerability to environmental compounds.

"Compound repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease using knowledge graphs, insurance claims data, and gene expression complementarity PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal focuses on the challenge of identifying drug repositioning candidates for Alzheimer’s Disease. The foundation of this work is the ReFRAME library, a set of ~13,000 compounds that includes nearly all small molecules that have been FDA-approved, reached clinical development, or undergone significant preclinical profiling. The ReFRAME library is being actively screened against a diverse cross-section of in vitro assays. This proposal pursues three distinct strategies for identifying repositioning candidates among the ReFRAME collection. First, we will create and mine a large and heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph. We will use machine learning methods to identify repositioning candidates based on properties of the knowledge graph surrounding and joining each drug and disease. Second, we will mine a massive data set of insurance claims data for associations between drug use and the incidence or severity of Alzheimer’s Disease. Containing almost 7 billion medical claims and over 2 billion pharmacy claims, this data set represents the largest source of claims data available. Third, we will use concept of gene expression complementarity to identify repositioning candidates. We will generate a gene expression signature for every ReFRAME compound in three cell lines relevant to Alzheimer’s Disease, and we will screen for compounds that produce a signature that appear to reverse gene expression changes seen in Alzheimer’s Disease. After assembling repositioning candidates identified through all three of these methods, we will prioritize up to 100 compounds (or compound combinations) for further characterization and validation. These follow-up experiments will initially investigate the activity of these compounds in five cell-based assays to establish a mechanistic hypothesis on their mechanism of action in Alzheimer’s Disease. Secondary follow-up experiments may include validation in some combination of in vitro (including hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons and/or organoids) and in vivo systems. We believe that the multifaceted approach described in this proposal offers the best possible chance at successfully identifying AD repositioning candidates. Moreover, this work will create methods and resources that will be useful to the broader scientific community, both for Alzheimer’s Disease and for other disease areas. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project focuses on discovering new treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease. We specifically are looking for drugs that are already approved (or were previously tested) to treat other diseases to see if they can be beneficial for Alzheimer’s Disease patients. We will make and test predictions about which chemical compounds will have benefit, either alone or in combination.","Compound repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease using knowledge graphs, insurance claims data, and gene expression complementarity",10137167,R01AG066750,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Blue Cross', 'Blue Shield', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'FDA approved', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Neurons', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical development', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'insurance claims', 'interest', 'knowledge graph', 'machine learning method', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical development', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend', 'validation studies']",NIA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,886543
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,10144417,R01DK101674,"['Ablation', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cresol', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Diet Modification', 'Ecosystem', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Individuality', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Process', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Sulfate', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Uremia', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'colon microbiota', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'dietary', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human subject', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstitution', 'solute', 'tool', 'translation to humans']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,644301
"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Project Summary Summary from the Application 5 R01 GM107550-08 “Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products” Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks. The capacity to make such connections will accelerate new compound discovery as well as create associations between gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, and aid in fast and accurate structure elucidations. Combined with this informatics approach, this proposed continuation project explores innovative methods by which to solve complex molecular structures by enhanced MS and NMR experiments, as well as the development of new algorithms by which to accelerate their analysis. Thus, the overarching goal of this grant is to develop efficient methods that facilitate automated structural classification, structural feature discovery and ultimately efficient structure elucidation of natural products (or any small molecule) and to build an infrastructure that interacts with data input from the community. We will achieve this with the following four specific aims: Aim 1. Integration of MS2 molecular networking with gene cluster networking to rapidly and efficiently locate natural products that have unique molecular architectures; Aim 2. To develop a suite of high sensitivity pulse sequences for natural product structure elucidation; Aim 3. To develop NMR based molecular networking strategies using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to facilitate the categorization and structure elucidation of organic compounds; Aim 4. To integrate NMR molecular networking and MS2 -based molecular networking as an efficient structure characterization and elucidation strategy. By achieving these aims we will develop an innovative workflow for finding new compounds and for determining their structures, both quickly and accurately. The connection between gene cluster and molecule will shed light on stereochemistry and potential halogenations and methylations.

"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Summary from the Application 5 R01 GM107550-08 “Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products” Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks.

"Biosynthesis of antifungal nucleoside antibiotics Project Summary/Abstract This equipment supplement project aims to purchase a liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (LCMS) instrument essential for the discovery, biosynthesis, and development of antifungal nucleoside antibiotics. The parent R01 aims to understand the biosynthesis of peptidyl nucleoside (PN) antifungal antibiotics active against multiple pathogenic fungi such as the causal agent of ""Valley Fever"" and to discover novel antifungal agents using this knowledge. For this study, one of the most significant technical challenges is the characterization of hydrophilic nucleoside compounds because these compounds do not bind to the conventional reverse-phase columns most frequently used for LCMS. To overcome this challenge, we propose the purchase of a biocompatible (metal-free) ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) unit coupled with a quadrupole time of flight (QTOF) MS device. Biocompatible UHPLC will allow the use of various hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) columns for the analysis of polar metabolites. The QTOF MS detector will allow discovery-oriented (untargeted) analyses of complex metabolite mixtures. The proposed system will enable the purification of the analytes while monitoring MS chromatograms, which is impossible with other LCMS instruments available at Duke. Also, having an instrument dedicated to the preparation and analysis of hydrophilic compounds will significantly improve the turnaround time of our analyses from 2-3 weeks to within a day. Therefore, the purchase of the proposed LCMS will provide unique capabilities currently unavailable to us but essential for the successful characterization of nucleoside antibiotics proposed in the parent project. The proposed research is significant because it will provide a basis for the future chemoenzymatic preparation or genome mining discovery of novel nucleoside antifungals. Project Narrative Peptidyl nucleosides (PNs) are potent and selective antifungal antibiotics against fungi pathogenic to humans. Understanding their biosynthesis by bacterial producers and the discovery of novel PNs are important steps for their successful development into clinically useful molecules, and the ability to perform liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (LCMS) analysis of hydrophilic metabolites is essential for this understanding. Therefore, the purchase of a biocompatible LCMS instrument will contribute to developing fundamental knowledge about PNs that will help to combat fungal infectious diseases.",Biosynthesis of antifungal nucleoside antibiotics,10389266,R01GM115729,"['Acids', 'Actinobacteria class', 'Amides', 'Anabolism', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anions', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cell Wall', 'Cellular Structures', 'Charge', 'Chitin', 'Chromatography', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Coupled', 'Culture Media', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Enzymatic Biochemistry', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment', 'Exhibits', 'Fungal Components', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Human', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Ions', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Ligase', 'Ligation', 'Lipids', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Mycoses', 'Natural Products', 'Nucleosides', 'Organism', 'Oxygenases', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Polysaccharides', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Salvelinus', 'Scanning', 'Solvents', 'Structure', 'Substrate Specificity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Travel', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'alpha ketoglutarate', 'analog', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'chromophore', 'combat', 'desert fever', 'detector', 'experimental study', 'fungus', 'hydrophilicity', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'nikkomycin', 'novel', 'parent project', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pressure', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'text searching', 'time of flight mass spectrometry']",NIGMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,159212
"Preclinical development of a novel therapeutic for Parkinson's disease Project Summary Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, afflicting ~1 million Americans. Levodopa is the gold-standard symptomatic treatment for PD by elevating dopamine levels in the brain. Though the most effective treatment, prolonged levodopa use leads to 1) the debilitating side effect, levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), and 2) diminished levodopa efficacy which leads to fluctuations of PD symptoms, known as “wearing-off”. These concerns are two of the greatest unmet needs in PD and affect how doctors prescribe dosages and treatment options, impacting the efficacy of the necessary medications for PD. After 5 years of levodopa usage, 40% of PD patients will develop LID and/or fluctuations. Not only having a clinical impact, but PD patients with such complications require nearly $60,000 of additional therapeutics every year. Using Sinopia Biosciences’ computational platform, we studied gene expression changes due to levodopa administered to 6-OHDA lesioned PD-like mice. Applying our computational workflow, we identified a small molecule (SB-0107) that was selected based on: 1) having one of the top scores from our platform, 2) its novel mechanism of action, 3) previous clinical exposure to elderly patients, 4) its predicted CNS penetration properties, and 5) its potential for patent protection. Subsequently, we demonstrated the compound’s unique and potentially transformative pharmacology for treating both the symptoms of PD and complications of levodopa (i.e. LID). In both rodent and primate models, SB-0107 shows large effect sizes. Further, we observed in a cognitive deficit primate model of PD that SB-0107 improves performances in the tested cognitive tasks. Thus, SB-0107 represents a promising candidate for advancement to the clinic for PD. In this Fast-Track proposal, we will advance the compound by completing preclinical development studies for anticipation of IND submission. Project Narrative Levodopa is the primary treatment for Parkinson’s Disease, a neurodegenerative disease that afflicts 1 million Americans. Unfortunately, levodopa has serious side effects and loses its efficacy over time. Using Sinopia Biosciences’s computational drug discovery platform, we identified a small molecule that we subsequently tested and validated in relevant rodent and primate models, providing a unique mechanism for treating Parkinson’s Disease. This proposal will complete preclinical drug development for this compound in order to advance to the clinic.",Preclinical development of a novel therapeutic for Parkinson's disease,10324284,R44NS124398,"['Acute', 'Adjuvant', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'American', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Case Study', 'Chronic', 'Climacteric', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Germany', 'Gold', 'Half-Life', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'L-DOPA induced dyskinesia', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Levodopa', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver Microsomes', 'MPTP Poisoning', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Oxidopamine', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preclinical Drug Development', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Rodent', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'base', 'behavior test', 'candidate selection', 'clinical development', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'computational platform', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drug discovery', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'meetings', 'metabotropic glutamate receptor 4', 'motor behavior', 'motor symptom', 'nerve stem cell', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'older patient', 'preclinical development', 'preclinical efficacy', 'preclinical study', 'response', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'symptom treatment']",NINDS,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2021,577562
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,10141255,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,291940
"Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery Project Summary High-throughput omics technologies allow for measuring various biomolecules comprehensively and over the past decade have become exponentially less expensive. Coupling these emerging technologies with automation approaches and the phenotypic-based drug discovery paradigm allows for data-driven drug discovery (D4). D4 focuses on a complete cellular readout, quantitatively measuring 100s to 100,000s of biomolecules or cellular features, rather than focusing on a single protein, pathway, or physiological trait. The complexity of this data requires computational tools for proper analysis and interpretation. In Phase I of this proposal, we combined the dual strengths of experts in LC-MS/MS based metabolomics (Omix Technologies) with leaders in metabolomics data analysis (Sinopia Biosciences) to develop a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform. We screened ~250 FDA approved small molecules from a broad range of drug classes on two cell lines. This dataset was compared to a matching dataset from the pioneering project for D4, the Connectivity Map, which is a transcriptomics screening and query platform for drug characterization, discovery, and repositioning. In Phase I, we observed that from both a technical and biological utility standpoint, the metabolomics data provided an orthogonal dataset with signal fidelity, sensitivity, and relevance to compound properties comparable to or exceeding the Connectivity Map. Further, we saw high concordance of plasma metabolite changes in type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis patients with in vitro metabolite changes of related drugs used for those indications. Thus, these results suggest that a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform is not only viable as a complementary dataset to the Connectivity Map, but that metabolomics data can even play a primary role in drug discovery. In this Phase II proposal, we will focus on profiling chemical and genetic perturbations in vitro to further demonstrate the power of the platform and identify commercial opportunities for treating genetically defined rare diseases. We will expand data generation to ~3300 bioactive compounds across three cell lines. Further, we will profile 50 genetic knockouts on those three cell lines to model in vitro the associated rare diseases. Using Sinopia’s platform, we will select compounds for follow-up evaluation to identify candidates that correct for metabolic dysregulations seen in those rare diseases. Successful in vitro programs will aid in seeding of an early stage discovery pipeline that will be advanced through funding by private investment, patient advocacy groups, and additional federal grants. Project Narrative Data-driven drug discovery provides the potential to accelerate drug development timelines, decrease costs, and ultimately provide better care to patients. Combining Sinopia Bioscience’s and Omix Technologies strengths in high-throughput data generation and analysis, we have built a unique platform focused on understanding the use of metabolomics in drug discovery.

"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,10087862,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,1140875
"Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry). Narrative This project addresses a current critical challenge in the discovery and development of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These studies will create a new powerful technology for accelerated antibiotic development targeting diverse bacteria and give rise to new families of antibiotics.",Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development,10094184,R01AI136799,"['Address', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemistry', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Efflux', 'Drug Modelings', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Infection', 'Kinetics', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Penetration', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Walkers', 'antibiotic efflux', 'base', 'cell envelope', 'clinical investigation', 'efflux pump', 'experience', 'experimental analysis', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'kinetic model', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'resistance mechanism', 'resistant strain', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'uptake']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2021,1106111
"Genome-wide structure-based analysis of protein-protein interactions and networks Project Summary  Our lab works in the general area of computational structural biology although it also includes an experimental component. We carry out theoretical and computational research and develop software tools, with our efforts being guided by a variety of applications of biomedical importance. In the past we have elucidated the structural and energetic origins of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, developed methods for protein structure prediction, and detected novel structural and functional relationships between proteins based on their geometric similarity. We currently focus on two distinct areas: the exploitation of structural information to predict protein function on a genome-wide scale and the molecular basis of cell-cell recognition. The former topic is the subject of the current proposal which focuses on the prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein interaction networks. Our overarching goal is to provide a structure-informed perspective in multiple areas of systems biology, thus filling a major gap in this rapidly growing area of biomedical research.  Our research plans are derived from our development of the PrePPI algorithm and corresponding database of human PPIs. PrePPI provides proteome-wide structure-based predictions of PPIs, and discovers relationships not obtainable from other methods. The P-HIPSTer algorithm, which is derived from PrePPI, offers analogous information for virus-human PPIs for 1000 human-infecting viruses. The reliability of both resources has been validated experimentally, and both have revealed novel biological insights. PrePPI, in common with other PPI databases, is cell-context independent and, for example, does not distinguish among tissue and tumor types. To address this challenge, we developed the OncoSig algorithm that uses machine learning methods to combine PrePPI with regulatory interactions from patient genomic data. The generation of tumor-specific lists of PPIs, called SigSets, can then be mapped onto a context-dependent PPI network, or SigMap. We have also developed novel methodologies that link protein structure space with chemical compound space.  The current proposal builds on these accomplishments with new methodological developments and new applications to network biology. We plan to integrate PrePPI with PPI information derived from genetic interactions derived from the correlation of gene profiles across many conditions (e.g. tumor types, cell lines or drug treatments). This will provide an unprecedented structure- and context-dependent view of protein interaction networks. Other plans include the extension of PrePPI to non-human genomes and the extension of P-HIPSTer to bacterial pathogens. Our overall vision includes the development of an integrated set of software tools and databases that will advance cutting edge biomedical applications. These tools will range in scope from protein- protein interaction networks, structure-derived protein function annotation and to the linking of network biology to chemical compound space which will suggest druggable targets within networks and provide leads for small molecules that can target individual proteins. Project Narrative This project focuses on the modeling and incorporation of protein three-dimensional structures across the human proteome to further our ability to describe disease-related protein-protein interaction networks in tissue- and tumor-specific contexts. These structure-informed networks will reveal mechanistic insights regarding cellular processes underlying human diseases ranging from cancer to those resulting from viral and bacterial infection. Our results will also provide hypotheses regarding drugs that can target proteins in these networks.",Genome-wide structure-based analysis of protein-protein interactions and networks,10086553,R35GM139585,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'druggable target', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'insight', 'link protein', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R35,2021,405000
"Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention Project Summary/Abstract Viruses are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) being one of the most infectious and prevalent among them. Roughly 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, including 1-2 million in the United States. Of those infected, approximately 15-25% will develop se- rious liver problems, including cirrhosis, cancer, and ultimately failure, leading to 600,000 deaths annually. While therapies exist to manage chronic HBV infection, all target viral genomic processes such as reverse transcription and DNA replication, and none provide a cure due to viral persistence and resistance. A promising orthogonal approach to eliminating infection is to target HBV's capsid, the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome. The Finn laboratory has previously developed compounds that induce the misdirected assembly of non-functional HBV capsids, showing that small molecules have the power to affect the structures of these large multi-protein assemblies. While much is known about the structures of the intermolecular interactions with these compounds identiﬁed after the fact, little about the dynamics of such interactions has been explored, and a predictive under- standing of functional (antiviral) binding has yet to be developed. Both deﬁciencies will begin to be addressed in this program. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with in vitro experiments on HepAD38 cells, the PIs have identiﬁed seven compounds based on motifs previously unknown to interact with HBV that target the capsid assembly process. These compounds bind in a known pocket at the interface of two capsid-protein (Cp) dimers, possess moderate antiviral activity, and low toxicity. In the ﬁrst aim, using docking, free-energy perturba- tion, and synthetic chemistry, the PIs will optimize the lead compound to improve its efﬁcacy against HBV. In the second aim, using molecular dynamics simulations, advanced free-energy calculations, and experimental assays on different HBV protein oligomers, up to and including the whole virus capsid, the PIs will determine how small molecules interfere with capsid assembly. Both aims will beneﬁt from using a machine-learning-based classiﬁ- cation scheme as well as novel enhanced sampling methods. The lessons learned here concerning how small molecules can re-direct the assembly pathway into unproductive conformations can be generalized for application to other viruses. Project Narrative In spite of the dramatic increase in our understanding of the structure and properties of hepatitis B virus (HBV), this pathogen remains a major threat to human health. That knowledge also makes HBV an important test case for new antiviral strategies. This project aims to limit the impact of HBV by using computer simulations and synthetic chemistry to develop an improved understanding of the assembly process of HBV as well as new drugs that can eliminate HBV infection in ways that may be generalized to other pathogenic viruses.",Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention,10159864,R01AI148740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Capsid', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Encapsulated', 'Equilibrium', 'Failure', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'dimer', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intermolecular interaction', 'lead optimization', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogenic virus', 'programs', 'protein oligomer', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success', 'viral genomics']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,393060
"A Preclinical Program for Targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis KasA ABSTRACT  We present herein a grant application focused on the late-stage development of preclinical candidate JSF-3285. Per our recently published research, we have disclosed the genesis of this program that led to the hit compound DG167 and identification of the essential β-keto acyl synthase KasA as its target. Building on this effort, our preliminary data detail the optimization to arrive at JSF-3285 which is efficacious in the acute and chronic models of M. tuberculosis infection in mice at doses as low as 5 mg/kg once-daily oral. This proposal seeks to build on this data by conducting the requisite drug combination and relapse studies to achieve clinical status and begin IND-enabling studies. In addition, we propose a second generation program based on preliminary data consisting of a structurally distinct amide series with promising in vitro efficacy, mouse PK, and X-ray structural data. The grant's second aim will evolve this series, leveraging our extensive X-ray structural data, SAR, and machine learning models, to produce at minimum novel early lead compounds if not compounds equal to or surpassing JSF-3285. The sum total of the two aims, featuring JSF-3285 and second generation candidate/s, will lend a high probability to a KasA inhibitor becoming clinically relevant in the next 5 years. PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT  This proposal will develop a new therapy that will help to cure drug-susceptible and drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis. It will also have the potential to reduce the length of time need to treat tuberculosis and inhibit new resistance from occurring. If our research goals are achieved, the novel therapy would be an important step towards the global eradication of tuberculosis.",A Preclinical Program for Targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis KasA,10209330,R01AI153145,"['Acute', 'Amides', 'Anabolism', 'Applications Grants', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Butane', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Wall', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Companions', 'Comprehension', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Enzymes', 'Essential Genes', 'Exhibits', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Benefit', 'In Vitro', 'Indoles', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycolic Acid', 'Oral', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rifampin', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Sulfonamides', 'Sum', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Validation', 'analog', 'animal efficacy', 'azetidine', 'base', 'clinical candidate', 'clinically relevant', 'combinatorial', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug relapse', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extensive drug resistance', 'fatty acid biosynthesis', 'global health', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'isoniazid', 'model development', 'nanomolar', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical development', 'programs', 'resistant strain', 'risk minimization', 'skills', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy duration', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,RBHS-NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,826401
"Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the 6th leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Although up to 40% of adult patients are responsive to standard chemotherapy, almost all relapse and progress to resistant disease. Most AML patients display no cytogenetic abnormalities or driver mutations, which poses a significant challenge for designing targeted therapy. Combination therapy may also be useful for preventing resistance and improving overall survival. Recent advances in epigenomics have shed light on cellular reprogramming in cancer. Epigenetic proteins can modulate gene expression to induce pathways that increase cell proliferation and decrease differentiation. Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is an epigenetic protein overexpressed in AML. CARM1 has been identified as a key regulator of myeloid differentiation and cancer progression; and is overexpressed in primary, resistant, and recurrent AML. CARM1’s mechanistic role in AML induction and progression (including relevant substrates and regulation) is still unclear, which presents an additional challenge for clinicians to design new therapies. To address gaps in our current understanding of CARM1 function and the need for new AML therapies, I aim to (1) Identify compounds that target CARM1 expression and compounds that work in synergy with a known CARM1 inhibitor in AML and (2) Identify novel chemotypes that directly inhibit CARM1 using a hybrid approach of machine learning and simulations of small molecule-protein interactions. These aims support key goals of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Precision Medicine Initiative, including (1) understanding cancer progression, (2) genomic analysis, (3) advancing precision medicine, (4) bioinformatics and (5) translational research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the bone marrow, where immature cells accumulate and disrupt the production of normal blood cells, disrupting normal blood formation and organ function. Despite advances in research, AML patients are typically treated with chemotherapy agents that often fail to cure them and frequently lead to relapse. We propose to create new therapies for repressing AML based on targeting the epigenome, or the pattern of chemical modification of DNA and histones, the proteins that package and order DNA to promote gene expression.",Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML,10056204,F31CA228331,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Apoptosis', 'Arginine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Cells', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Modification Process', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Docking', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Synergism', 'Embryonic Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histones', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Bone Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Myelogenous', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Network-based', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Production', 'Protein Methyltransferases', 'Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'acute myeloid leukemia cell', 'analog', 'base', 'blood formation', 'chemotherapy', 'coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1', 'design', 'driver mutation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F31,2021,51036
"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,10180915,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stimulator of Interferon Genes', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2021,714132
"Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types  This proposal outlines the protocols and techniques I will be using to optimize drug discovery of ASCT2, a promising target for anti-cancer therapeutics. ASCT2 plays a key role in increasing the glutamine influx for tumor cells to maintain such high metabolic rates required for rapid proliferation. The first structures of ASCT2 were recently determined experimentally, making this a newly viable target for structure-based studies ASCT2 was only recently discovered to play a critical role in cancer cell metabolism and little medicinal chemistry efforts have been focused on ASCT2 antagonist development allowing immense potential for breaking into new compound scaffolds for further testing. Currently, there have not been any ASCT2 drug campaigns that incorporate computational drug discovery methods and this proposal outlines the first studies dedicated to this.  Many institutions and pharmaceutical companies have implemented computational strategies into drug discovery pipelines as a means to produce viable drug candidates in a more cost-efficient and timely manner. Depending on the target of interest, researchers focus more intently on either ligand-based (LB) or structure-based (SB) methods, but rarely are these two methods hybridized in a sophisticated fashion. By utilizing strategies of both LB- and SB- computational drug discovery, I intend to merge the advantages of both methodologies as a means to sample and filter large chemical space more efficiently. Our lab has active development in two computational chemistry software suites: Rosetta primarily focuses on SB methods whereas the Biology and Chemistry Library (BCL) contains advanced cheminformatics toolsets for LB methods. The focus of my project will be to integrate the RosettaDrugDesign code to allow a more extensive, yet efficient sampling of chemical space using ligand-based techniques. We intend to incorporate these more advanced LB techniques available in the BCL, including multi-tasking artificial neural networks for Quantitative Structure- Activity Relationship predictions, to filter compounds during docking simulations within the RosettaDrugDesign. By bringing together the structure prediction abilities of Rosetta and small- molecule tools of BCL, we anticipate exceptional advances in our abilities to efficiently design drugs for ASCT2. Project Narrative The upregulated influx of amino acids is critical to maintain an altered metabolic state for rapidly proliferating cells such as those found in tumors, making transporters such as ASCT2 a promising target for cancer therapeutics. Computational-based drug discovery methods have not been heavily utilized for ASCT2 due to lack of an experimentally determined structure; however with the recently solved structure, these methods are now possible and highly favorable for guiding medicinal chemistry efforts. This proposal outlines the plans for hybridized structure- and ligand-based approaches for computational drug discovery of ASCT2 antagonists and the experimental validation obtained utilizing in silico methods.","Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types",10003012,F31CA243353,"['Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Transporter', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cysteine', 'Data', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Education', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Facility Accesses', 'Formulation', 'Glutamine', 'Homologous Protein', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Play', 'Proliferating', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Serine', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cheminformatics', 'computational chemistry', 'computing resources', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in silico', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'metabolic rate', 'method development', 'multitask', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor metabolism']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38247
"IAA-NCEA/EPA-0001; “Chemoinformatics of EPA’s EDSP Universe of Chemicals” Chemoinformatic support for two IAA/USEPA projects with DNTP were performed; first project with EPA's ECOTOX database and the second project with EPA's NCEA (Natl Ctr Environmental Assessment).  (1) The ECOTOXicology Knowledgebase (ECOTOX) is a comprehensive, publicly available knowledgebase providing single chemical environmental toxicity data on aquatic life, terrestrial plants and wildlife. To streamline this labor-intensive process, Sciome evaluated the feasibility of using machine learning methods to automatically classify documents according to relevance, and to identify the exclusion rationale for those references that are excluded. There are ~45,000 references that have been manually curated by EPA in ECOTOX database over the course of the last thirty years of database growth and development. The current data curation process consists of several manual and time-consuming steps. The process could be greatly shortend and made more consistent by use of AI (artificial intelligence) software tools and a process was initiated to develop an ECOTOX lexicon and develop a strategy for automated curation.  (2) For the 2nd project with NCEA, the EDSP Universe of Chemicals was analyzed towards forming a database portal.  An initial clustering exercise was completed on ~700 compounds that were fully and unambiguously curated.  Further clustering was extended to the union of compounds (~14K) obtained by searching the CompTox Dashboard for CAS numbers and Names provided in the file shared by EPA. Each clustering experiment involved complete data cleaning and harmonization, structure quantification by several fingerprints and descriptors followed by investigating several distance measurements and clustering methods.  Some class-specific clustering experiments with methods to identify parsimonious set of clusters were pursued.   After weighing pros and cons of several available platforms for developing the EDSP portal, EPA and Sciome agreed that the EDSP Portal would be developed on the Python/Django platform. The Portal would initially house some physical-chemistry data and Tier-1 bio-assay data for the compounds that have so far been unambiguously curated. The functionality of the Portal could be continually enhanced through a regular show-and-feedback cycle with the clients. n/a",IAA-NCEA/EPA-0001; “Chemoinformatics of EPA’s EDSP Universe of Chemicals”,10379865,73201700001C,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Client', 'Collaborations', 'Consumption', 'Contractor', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Exclusion', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Growth and Development function', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Names', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Review Literature', 'Screening procedure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'base', 'dashboard', 'data cleaning', 'data curation', 'data harmonization', 'design', 'environmental chemical', 'experimental study', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",N01,2021,175000
