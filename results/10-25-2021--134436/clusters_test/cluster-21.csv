"CT and CXR Phenotyping Platform for Assessing COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity Abstract COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11. Since then, there have been 8.15 million confirmed cases worldwide with a case fatality rate ranging from 16.3% to 0.1%. In the US, there have been 2,187,202 cases with a 5.4% case fatality rate as of June 16, 2020. The magnitude of this infectious disease has stressed the need to develop novel methodologies to define who are at the highest risk of developing acute symptoms. X-Ray (CXR) and Computed Tomography (CT) play a fundamental role in the detection and follow-up of the COVID-19 lung injury. It also provides a unique opportunity to define quantitative biomarkers that may identify susceptible subjects to the acute phase of the disease using pre-infection and early infection radiological exams. This proposal's broad objective is to provide a better understanding of acute COVID-19 susceptibility markers based on artificial intelligence approaches on radiological exams, both CT and CXR. CT offers a unique way to phenotype the lung and its changes. Subtle changes of normal parenchyma have been associated with systemic inflammation that can be detected on CT. We hypothesize that susceptible subjects for acute COVID- 19 disease evolution will express inflamed normal parenchymal signatures that can be measured on CT scan prior to the infection or in the early phases of the viral infection. We will develop new computational approaches to identify radiographic patterns consistent with inflamed normal parenchyma as well as early COVID-19 injury and compute radiomics signature that can capture the heterogeneity of the radiographic expression for each lung pattern. We will define new CT-based biomarkers for acute COVID-19 susceptibility using Gradient Boosting decision trees and feature importance. We will then translate the quantification of the most relevant features in CXR image using image translation approaches based on deep neural networks. Finally, we will integrate these automated tools in the CIP workstation using clinically friendly end-to-end workflows to empower clinical investigations across the world. We will continue the support and dissemination of this tool across the research community. Over the last 15 years, our group has developed the Chest Imaging Platform (CIP), an NIH-funded open-source software tool for the automated phenotyping of chest CT scans that is widely used in the chronic lung disease research community. Since the beginning of the pandemic, CIP has been used to the characterization of COVID-19 using existing densitometric metrics. Our commitment to open science in the form of open toolkits that are freely distributed is fundamental to catalyze the application of AI and imaging in the context of this pandemic. Project Narrative As of June 16, there has been 2.18 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States with 118,435 fatalities. Unlike many other diseases, only general epidemiological factors are available for describing the susceptibility to COVID-19 and its acute phase. Biomarkers computed from CT and CXR images of the chest provides a personalized approach to define prognostic markers of disease susceptibility.",CT and CXR Phenotyping Platform for Assessing COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity,10196276,R21LM013670,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'COVID-19 susceptibility', 'Case Fatality Rates', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Epidemiologic Factors', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Smoking', 'Software Tools', 'Stress', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute care', 'acute symptom', 'base', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging platform', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pandemic disease', 'personalized approach', 'prognostic', 'prognostic model', 'radiomics', 'response', 'severe COVID-19', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapeutic development', 'tool']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,155730
"Lung Navigation System for Localizing and Resecting Nodules Project Abstract  Although Wedge Resection Surgery results in better lung function, tumor recurrence rate is almost double that of lobectomy, with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates. This may be attributed to the difficulty in accurately localizing and resecting the nodules in a deflated lung. Currently, there is no effective method of accurately localizing the nodules and guiding the surgical stapling device to the optimal resection margin. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate algorithms and technologies to manage lung nodules from diagnosis to surgical resection. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop a lung navigation (LungNav) system to localize and excise, with sufficient margin, small and early malignant lung nodules. The experimental methods will be to design and develop the LungNav system integrated with an active nodule tracker called J-bar, machine learning algorithms for determining the optimal resection margin, and tracked surgical stapling device for accurately excising the nodule. Tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality displays will be developed to visualize the nodule on thoracosopy videos and guide the surgical stapler in real-time to the optimal margin. The hypothesis is that by anchoring the J-bar close to the nodule, the nodule position can be accurately tracked in real-time despite significant tissue deformation when the lung is collapsed and manipulated during surgery. To achieve the goals of this project, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design and develop the nodule tracker (J-bar) and deformation algorithms to estimate the real-time position of the nodule. 2) Investigate a machine-learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to determine the optimal resection margin. 3) Design and develop a software navigation module, called LungNav, for visualizing the tumor and navigating the surgical stapler to the optimal resection margin. 4) Validate the design and performance of the LungNav system using ex-vivo lung tissue and live porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it addresses an important problem, which potentially affects several thousand patients each year, of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung function. The research is innovative since it builds on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, navigation systems and augmented reality methods to accurately diagnose and localize the nodule in presence of significant tissue deformation. The expected outcome of the project is the development of CNN-based machine learning algorithms for lung nodule classification and a LungNav system with tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality methods to localize and guide complete surgical resection of lung nodules.

"A scalable non-intrusive image annotation method using eye tracking for training deep learning models in radiology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Machine learning (ML) and artiﬁcial intelligence have recently emerged as powerful techniques that can augment radiology interpretations and show promise for improving patient outcomes. One of the ways for ML to make a signiﬁcant impact on health care is in improving the evaluation of high-volume, low-cost exams for early signs of a wide variety of diseases.The routine chest x-ray is an ”opportunity for screening” for diseases, including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and congestive heart failure. For instance, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the US, and is typically diagnosed at a higher stage than most other cancers leading to low survival rates. The National Lung Screening Trial reported that low dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening resulted in a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality; however, few eli- gible people actually undergo LDCT screening. Meanwhile, chest x-rays continue to be the most common form of imaging worldwide. Improved detection from x-rays can direct patients to LDCT. COPD is another important disease that is often under-diagnosed. People with COPD are at increased risk of lung cancer and respiratory infections, or exacerbations, which are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, a chest x-ray may show poorly-deﬁned regions of consolidation that are concerning for pneumonia. Medical attention is re- quired to treat an infection or evaluate for other cause. More generally, methods to detect disease on chest x-rays can be extended to cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema and pleural effusions which are seen in congestive heart failure. Improved detection can direct patients to medical care. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), a highly successful ML model, can be applied to chest x-ray images. However, few annotated medical datasets exist that are sufﬁciently large to train CNNs. Furthermore, it has been shown that bounding boxes used to localize disease can be incorporated into the training of CNNs and signiﬁcantly increase their accuracy. Unfortunately, medical datasets with such localized annotations are even rarer and are very limited in the number of cases due to the time-consuming process of creating bounding boxes by radiologists. We propose an innovative integrated approach using eye tracking, speech recording and novel vision and language models to create localized annota- tions in a manner that is non-intrusive to the workﬂow of the radiologist. The novelty of our approach is in the use of eye tracking during routine radiological reading. The challenge is to overcome the relatively ambiguous nature of eye tracking information compared to bounding boxes which provide deﬁnitive information about abnormalities. To address this challenge, we will also design new CNN architectures and learning algorithms that can use eye tracking and additional information such as pupil dilation and ﬁxation duration. The proposed methodology can easily scale up to create very large datasets without generating additional workload for radiologists. Furthermore, deployed in the reading room, it could provide a continuous stream of annotated images to expand training sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence hold the potential to improve patient outcomes by enhancing the eval- uation of low cost, routine chest x-rays for early imaging abnormalities associated with diseases such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia and making recommendations for follow-up care. To realize their full potential, machine learning algorithms require training on very large datasets with localized an- notations for abnormalities. We propose a novel data collection methodology using eye tracking that is scalable, non-intrusive to the workﬂow of the radiologist, and can generate very large datasets with localized annotations for the development of novel machine learning algorithms to address signiﬁcant medical problems.",A scalable non-intrusive image annotation method using eye tracking for training deep learning models in radiology,10133070,R21EB028367,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiomegaly', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Language', 'Localized Disease', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mydriasis', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Pupil', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Screening Result', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'base', 'computed tomography screening', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data collection methodology', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical attention', 'model building', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'sample fixation', 'scale up', 'screening', 'visual tracking']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2021,152500
"Rapid Structure-Function MRI of the Lung for Post-COVID-19 Management Project Summary The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented an unprecedented crisis and challenge to public health, with tremendous health care and economic burden to our society. Given the high morbidity of this new disease and increasing findings on COVID-associated complications, it has emerged as an important and urgent clinical need to investigate the sequelae in patients recovered from COVID-19 (post-COVID patients), particularly with respect to residual long-term lung damage such as post-COVID decline of pulmonary function and/or development of lung structure abnormality. This will ensure that the long-term outcomes of post-COVID patients can be studied, better understood, and properly managed. At present, Computed Tomography (CT) is the gold standard for imaging lung anatomy, but its radiation burden precludes frequent longitudinal evaluations. Pulmonary function is currently evaluated by spirometry or plethysmography, which provide global measures of function but this is inadequate for assessing the extent of disease heterogeneity. The overarching aim of this application is to develop novel rapid free-breathing four-dimensional (4D=3D+motion) lung MRI techniques that will enable frequent evaluation of lung anatomy and function in the longitudinal follow-ups of post-COVID patients. These new methods will be based on a combination of compressed sensing and golden-angle radial acquisition, with incorporation of the latest advances in deep learning, which are all pioneered by our research team. Specifically, we propose to develop, optimize and evaluate a 10-minute free-breathing lung MRI protocol that will enable one-stop-shop characterization of whole lung anatomy and spatially-resolved pulmonary function without administration of contrast media. The overall hypothesis is that the proposed 4D MRI techniques can serve as a potential radiation-free alternative to CT for longitudinal evaluation of lung structure change and a better alternative to spirometry for deriving regional function parameters that could provide additional novel insights into the heterogeneity of lung ventilation and associated lung diseases. Our proposal includes the following three specific aims: (i) development of motion-resolved 4D UTE-MRI (MRI with ultra-shot echo times) for submillimeter resolution free-breathing whole-lung imaging, (ii) development of deep breathing-based 4D UTE-MRI for deriving global/regional pulmonary function parameters, and (iii) development of deep learning- based lung segmentation for efficient and automated estimation of pulmonary function parameters. Successful completion of this project will deliver non-invasive, non-contrast-enhanced, and free-breathing 4D MRI techniques for rapid assessment of lung anatomy and pulmonary function. Given the overwhelming prevalence of COVID-19 and the overall cumulative incidence in the United States, our novel imaging methods would provide a unique opportunity to augment post-COVID care, particularly for identifying COVID-19-induced lung fibrosis in a timely manner and for studying the longitudinal changes of lung anatomy and global/regional pulmonary function. These methods could also be extended for evaluation of other pulmonary diseases. Project Narrative The objective of this application is to develop novel rapid free-breathing four-dimensional (4D=3D+time) lung MRI techniques that will enable non-invasive radiation-free evaluation of lung anatomy and pulmonary function in the longitudinal follow-ups of post-COVID-19 patients.

"Classifying malignant pulmonary nodules using biophysics-enhanced artificial intelligence SUMMARY: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the United States with an estimated 140,000 deaths in 2020. While it has been demonstrated that lung screening reduces the mortality by 20%, accurate classification of malignant tumors remains an unmet need due to high rate of false positive cases. Current classification approaches by means of computed tomography (CT) screenings are based on statistical predictive models, and more recently artificial intelligence. Improving the classification accuracy of malignant tumors will reduce costs and the risk of mortality and guide clinical decision making. Here, we propose a novel framework to further improve the predictive power of current models by enriching the input information with biophysics-based computational models. The proposed computational model generates orthogonal information, which is based on laws of physics, and hence intrinsically unlearnable by artificial intelligence. We propose augmenting biophysical information since numerous studies have demonstrated that the tumor progression is strongly affected by the physical microenvironment in which they grow. Our overall objective here is to propose the physiological mechanical forces in lung as an informative and orthogonal biomarker to the existing input variables in state-of-the-art approaches to improve the prediction of malignancy risk in pulmonary nodules. Our central hypothesis is that coupling a biophysics-based computational model with the existing statistical models and artificial intelligence approaches will improve their prediction power in classifying malignant pulmonary nodules. Our hypothesis is based on published works and our preliminary data that the mechanical stresses in the lung are strongly correlated with both tumor incidence and growth. By coupling biophysics-based computational model, we plan to evaluate the improved classification performance in logistic regression model (Aim 1), as a highly interpretable model, and deep convolutional neural network (Aim 2), as a highly predictive model. Coupling biophysics-based computational model to artificial intelligence predictive tools will improve the prediction of power at no added financial and health burden to the patient. This novel approach, proposed here on lung cancer classification, has potential diagnostic and prognostic benefits in other pathological lung conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), fibrosis, mechanical ventilation, and bacterial and viral infection of the lung. NARRATIVE One of the primary medical concern in lung cancer screenings is the large number of nodules that are falsely diagnosed as malignant, which leads to added cost to patients and health care system. By proposing a novel method at the intersection of bioengineering and artificial intelligence, we are aiming at increasing the accuracy of discriminating benign from malignant lung nodules. The implementation of our approach is expected to better guide the clinical decision making, and improve the clinical and public health practice in lung cancer screenings.",Classifying malignant pulmonary nodules using biophysics-enhanced artificial intelligence,10195872,R21EB031332,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Benign', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Boston', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Force of Gravity', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Laws', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung infections', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Network-based', 'Nodule', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer classification', 'clinical decision-making', 'computational network modeling', 'computed tomography screening', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'mechanical force', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'screening', 'stem', 'therapy outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NIBIB,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2021,660000
"Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, jointly, are the fourth leading cause of death in the US and globally. Decades of research have not found disease-modifying therapies except for a1 antitrypsin deficiency, a rare disease found by improved phenotyping, characterized by a specific emphysema subtype and caused by gene variants in SERPINA1. This renewal builds on the successful discovery of six new quantitative emphysema subtypes (QES), which were associated independently with greater symptoms, impaired function and increased mortality in addition to several genome-wide significant associations for gene variants. In the renewal, we propose to leverage over 27,000 CTs acquired over 5-7 years of follow-up from 4,500 highly phenotyped and genotyped participants to test if deep and unsupervised learning on new state-of- the-art CTs and CT angiograms will reveal additional deep-learned and molecular QES that suggest mechanistic pathways to treatment. Further, we will collect 60 explanted lungs and use state-of-the art microCT to test if QES have distinct histology and structure. Finally, we will recruit 100 patients undergoing lung cancer CT screening to test if QES will be translatable to clinical low-dose lung cancer screening CT scans acquired on contemporary scanners. Successful completion of these aims will discover new deep QES and molecular QES and validate and translate QES to further subphenotype emphysema and facilitate testing of personalize molecular therapies and, hopefully, replicate the success of therapy for a1-antitrypsin deficiency for more common emphysema subtypes. Project Narrative In the first funding period, we discovered six QES, which are independently associated with morbidity, mortality and distinct gene variants that suggest targetable molecular pathways. This renewal builds upon our successful UML approach with integration of DL, greatly increased CT and genetic data; validates QES with histology; and translates QES to the clinic in order to facilitate testing of molecular therapies of specific QES and to redefine emphysema subtypes in clinical practice.",Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS,10160645,R01HL121270,"['Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Apical', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Data', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Endothelium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency', 'c new', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computed tomography screening', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lung cancer screening', 'microCT', 'mortality', 'novel', 'population based', 'recruit', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,730312
"Mechanisms & risk factors of chronic lung disease in HIV+ adolescents in Nairobi PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT As increasing numbers of children with HIV are surviving to adolescence in low- and middle-income countries, chronic lung disease (CLD) has emerged as an important but poorly understood complication amongst adolescents and young adults living with HIV (ALWH). In the ongoing, longitudinal BREATHE II Study (K23 HL129888, PI Attia) in Nairobi, Kenya, 19% of 162 ALWH have abnormal spirometry compared to 11% of 162 uninfected participants; 59% of ALWH have ≥1 abnormality on high-resolution chest CT scan, with mosaic attenuation among the most common. Chronic respiratory symptoms are also highly prevalent among 62% of ALWH and 49% of uninfected participants. HIV is independently associated with impaired lung function, and risk factors for impaired spirometry among ALWH include inhaled exposures, such as secondhand smoke and ambient fine particulate matter, as well as growth deficits. Objectives of the K23 research include: examining differences in risk factors and mechanisms of CLD progression over time; determining the role of HIV infection on change in lung function over time, considering the complex interplay with other risk factors; and, evaluating whether biomarkers of chronic immune activation and inflammation are associated with diminished lung function growth over time. However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, these longitudinal studies have been halted for safety reasons. As these studies can now resume with added precautions, an Administrative Supplement to this K23 will provide essential resources for the following Aims: 1) complete longitudinal lung function and clinical data collection to conduct planned analyses as proposed in the parent K23; 2) add testing for COVID-19 both to mitigate risk of potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 through spirometry (rapid PCR test) and to examine the role of COVID-19 infection on lung function growth and development (serologic antibody test). The indispensable support of this Supplement will maintain the BREATHE II cohort, a unique and innovative resource for understanding CLD progression among ALWH, especially those with perinatal HIV acquisition, compared to demographically similar uninfected participants from the same geographic catchment area in the context of COVID-19. This cohort includes a dataset of chest CTs that is larger than in any published literature to date. Serum for biomarker analysis (currently underway) has the potential to inform mechanistic pathways of CLD. The study infrastructure is already supporting implementation of sub-studies to obtain quantitative measures of air pollution exposure and to compare CLD in BREATHE II to a cohort of ALWH in a high-income setting, and is a well-positioned platform to support future sub-studies. Findings of this research will provide critical data for informing R01-level research to investigate novel insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of CLD progression in ALWH in resource-limited settings, shedding light on risk factors and mechanisms that can be targeted by preventative and therapeutic interventions to mitigate the burden of CLD. PROJECT NARRATIVE As increasing numbers of children with HIV are surviving to adolescence in resource-limited settings, chronic lung disease has emerged as an important but poorly understood complication among adolescents and young adults living with HIV. This Administrative Supplement supports completion of longitudinal lung function and data collection as proposed in the parent K23 to conduct planned analyses to determine whether HIV infection and serum biomarkers of immune dysfunction are associated with diminished growth of lung function over time among adolescents and young adults living with HIV in Nairobi, Kenya, and adds on COVID-19 testing (rapid PCR and serologic antibody testing).

"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that predominately affects the lung and may affect other organs. We propose to construct a model to predict sarcoidosis progression or resolution by identifying microbial and immune interactions.

"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"The role of the lung microbiome in oxygen-induced lung injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background and long-term objectives: This proposed research will advance our understanding of how the lung microbiome contributes to the pathogenesis and perpetuation of oxygen-induced lung injury. Inhaled oxygen is among our most commonly administered therapies. Yet hyperoxia - elevated inspired oxygen - causes lethal lung injury in animals, and in humans is associated with increased mortality and development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. We have recently discovered that hyperoxia acutely alters lung microbiota. This oxygen-induced dysbiosis is strongly and temporally correlated with alveolar inflammation. We have discovered that germ-free mice - experimental mice devoid of microbiota - are protected from oxygen- induced lung injury, an observation that cannot be explained via our conventional model of oxygen-induced lung injury. Conversely, lung injury alters lung microbiota by changing bacterial growth conditions within the lung microenvironment. We have discovered that germ-free mice are protected from non-resolving lung injury (bleomycin), indicating that the microbiome is necessary for perpetuation of lung injury. The discovery of the lung microbiome has thus broadened our model of pathogenesis. The mechanisms by which lung microbiota mediate oxygen-induced lung injury, and are in turn altered by lung injury, are undetermined. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that specific bacteria within the lung ecosystem propel alveolar inflammation in oxygen-induced lung injury, and these bacteria are enriched within the lung microbiome both by hyperoxia itself and by the altered ecology of injured lungs. The rationale is that these discoveries will facilitate the development of therapies for the prevention and treatment of oxygen-related human lung disease. Specific Aim 1: To determine the microbial and molecular pathways by which oxygen therapy alters lung microbiota, mediating host inflammation and injury. We will accomplish this Aim by integrating complementary experimental approaches: in vivo heterogeneity analysis of host-microbiome interactions in mice; in vivo germ-free, gnotobiotic, and antibiotic-treated hyperoxia modeling in mice; data science interrogation of observational human data using a validated machine-learning algorithm. Specific Aim 2: To determine the molecular pathways by which oxygen-induced host inflammation and injury alter lung microbiota, perpetuating respiratory dysbiosis and lung injury. We will accomplish this Aim by integrating complementary experimental approaches: a novel ex vivo culture assay that identifies host- derived mediators of bacterial growth; in vivo augmentation and inhibition of the host response in hyperoxia. This translational research approach will determine 1) the key members of the lung microbiome that mediate oxygen-induced lung injury, 2) the pathways by which these bacteria promote alveolar inflammation, and 3) the ecologic factors within the injured lung environment that promote their growth. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inhaled oxygen is among our most commonly administered therapies, yet hyperoxia - elevated inspired oxygen - causes lethal lung injury in animals, and in humans is associated with increased mortality and severe lung disease. We have recently discovered that the lung microbiome - the communities of microbes living in the respiratory tract - are altered by inhaled oxygen and necessary for the development of oxygen-induced lung injury. This proposed research plan will reveal how the lung microbiome contributes to oxygen-induced lung injury, and provide us with new ways to prevent and treat this common clinical problem.",The role of the lung microbiome in oxygen-induced lung injury,10202718,R01HL144599,"['Acute', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Bleomycin', 'Clinical', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hyperoxia', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation', 'Injury', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Therapy Care', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prevention', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Respiratory System', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Sterility', 'Translational Research', 'dysbiosis', 'host microbiome', 'host microbiota', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'lung injury', 'lung microbiome', 'lung microbiota', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,430284
"The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony Project Summary/Abstract Despite significant advances in ventilator management, mortality from the acute respiratory distress syn- drome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high. Mechanical ventilation with large tidal volume, high pressure ven- tilation, and repeated alveolar collapse can injure the lung, called ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). Defined as the inappropriate timing and delivery of a breath in response to a patient effort, ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) may potentiate VILI. This proposal outlines a 5-year training programing including mentoring, formal didactics, and practical research experiences which positions Dr. Sottile for a successful clinical research career examining ventilator dyssynchrony (VD), its impact on ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), and its optimal management. An integrated curriculum will optimize an automated VD detection algorithm, delineate which types of VD are deleterious, and determine the ideal ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD and improve patient outcomes. This experience will provide Dr. Sottile with the necessary tools to be a leader in signal analysis, ventilator dyssynchrony, advanced mathematical modeling, and critical care research. This program will consist of formal mentoring from four renowned experts in machine learning, mechanical ventilation, critical care research, and modeling of dynamic systems. In addition, coursework in clinical sciences, machine learning, and advanced mathematical modeling will build the theoretical foundation to apply these techniques. This structured curriculum will help Dr. Sottile gain expertise in the computerized detection of VD from real-time ventilator data, the pathophysiology of VD, and the modeling of complex, temporally dynamic, biological systems. The formal curriculum will coincide with three practical experiences. First, Dr. Sottile will optimize his already developed VD identification algorithm to detect additional types of VD that may be injurious to the lung. Second, he will identify which types of VD are associated with deleterious ventilator mechanics. Finally, he will deter- mine the personalized ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD, VILI, and the negative consequences of over sedation using linear optimization and lagged linear correlation to account for the dynamic nature of patient physiology. The result of the proposed studies will develop a computerized algorithm to detect seven types of VD, identify which types of VD are most likely to propagate VILI, and determine the optimal ventilator and sedation strategies to improve individual patient outcomes. This will leave Dr. Sottile and the study team positioned to conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing computer-predicted individualized ventilator and se- dation strategies compared to the current standard of care. If successful, this will potentially to revolutionize the use of mechanical ventilation by tailoring evidenced-based therapies to the individual patient. Project Narrative Despite over 50 years of research, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts of over 10% of ICU admissions. Despite current treatment strategies focused on reducing ventilator induced lung injury through low tidal volume ventilation or prone position, mortality remains over 30%. This proposal seeks to understand how patient-ventilator interactions may propagate lung injury and will determine optimal treatment strategies to improve patient- ventilator interactions, decrease lung injury, and improve patient outcomes.","The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony",10080102,K23HL145011,"['Accounting', 'Admission activity', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dysbarism', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial', 'Esophagus', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Induction of neuromuscular blockade', 'Injury', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manometry', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prone Position', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training Programs', 'Ventilator', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'biological systems', 'career', 'computerized', 'dynamic system', 'esophagus pressure', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'lung injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized strategies', 'pressure', 'programs', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2021,169654
"Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT Project Summary  In some individuals chronic tobacco smoke exposure results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Both of these parenchymal changes are irreversible, highlighting the importance of the early identification of their development and progression. Unfortunately, currently available methods for detecting the presence and evolution of these changes have limited sensitivity and specificity for very early disease and for subtle disease progression. Dr. Ash’s work has shown that automated objective analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest can detect clinically relevant radiologic findings called interstitial changes that may represent early pulmonary fibrosis, even in individuals without visually apparent disease. In the first aim of this proposal, Dr. Ash will refine and utilize a more sensitive and specific automated CT analysis tool that he and his lab have developed for the detection of both emphysema and interstitial changes. He will determine if emphysema and interstitial changes detected using this method are clinically significant in those patients deemed normal by previously performed visual analysis and in those deemed normal by other objective approaches. In the second aim, he will determine if areas of locally high density tissue in visually normal appearing lung parenchyma measured using augmented versions of his objective analysis tools are associated with mortality, other clinical outcomes, and peripheral measures of inflammation. Finally, in the third aim he will utilize these techniques to analyze longitudinal CT scans from the COPDGene study that were obtained over 10 years of follow-up, and will identify factors that predict or modify the development and progression of parenchymal changes on CT.  Dr. Ash will perform this work in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), a core teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, under the mentorship of Dr. George Washko, an expert in the field of medical image analysis and the co-principal investigator of the Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at BWH. With the guidance of Dr. Washko and his scientific advisory committee, Dr. Ash has developed a comprehensive five year training program to develop the skills needed to become an independent investigator with expertise in quantitative image analysis, including predictive modeling and statistical machine learning.  Dr. Ash is dedicated to a career in academic medicine. His goal is to become a clinician-scientist using the skills gained during this award to improve our ability to detect and monitor smoking related lung disease. The techniques he has proposed may help identify modifiable risk factors and treatments for smoking related lung disease, determine which patients are likely to benefit from treatment, and monitor the response to therapy. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, but only in a minority of smokers. This proposal aims to use advanced objective analysis of chest computed tomography images to detect the earliest manifestations of smoking related lung disease. This will enable us to identify susceptible patients at the earliest possible moment, track their disease progression, and ultimately shift treatment strategies from palliating disease related symptoms to preventing disease development.",Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT,10079021,K08HL145118,"['Advisory Committees', 'Area', 'Award', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Densitometry', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Evolution', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predictive Factor', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Symptoms', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chest computed tomography', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'exercise capacity', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interstitial', 'lung injury', 'mange', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'palliate', 'palliating symptoms', 'palliation', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protein biomarkers', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoking-related lung disease', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tobacco smoke exposure', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2021,170320
"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes.

"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal for a K08 Award is motivated by two overarching goals: 1) to support the scientific and professional development of the candidate, Dr. Paul Reyfman, towards achieving his career goal of succeeding as a physician scientist and independent investigator with expertise in systems biology approaches applied to the study of chronic lung disease, and 2) to investigate whether single-cell transcriptomic profiling can provide novel insights into the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a deadly and progressive condition for which diagnostic approaches remain imprecise and effective therapies are lacking. Together with his mentors, Drs. Scott Budinger and Luís Amaral, the candidate has developed a comprehensive training plan that will ensure Dr. Reyfman acquires new knowledge and proficiencies in developing hypotheses, designing and completing experiments, analyzing data, and communicating findings to the scientific community. As an essential component of this training plan, the candidate will employ systems biology approaches to developing tools for analysis of single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated from patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is increasingly used to investigate the pathobiology of disease in humans and as a basis for developing novel biomarkers of disease. Developing and validating tools for analyzing the rapidly growing quantity of single-cell transcriptomic data is as much of a challenge as refining techniques for generating data from healthy and diseased tissues. In particular, it is not known whether analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) data can be used to quantify accurately the cellular composition of the lung and to identify gene expression differences between health and pulmonary fibrosis. Our preliminary data suggest that scRNA-Seq of lung identifies profibrotic gene expression in patients with pulmonary fibrosis that is heterogeneous between individuals. We also found that scRNA-Seq undersampled certain constituent lung cellular populations. Accordingly, we designed this proposal to test the hypothesis that single-cell transcriptomic analysis of lung samples from patients with pulmonary fibrosis can be used to identify disease endotypes. In Specific Aim 1, the candidate will determine whether snRNA-Seq enables quantification of the cellular composition of the lung during pulmonary fibrosis. In Specific Aim 2, the candidate will develop tools for using scRNA-Seq performed on specimens obtained from patients with SSc-ILD and normal controls to gain novel insights into disease pathobiology. Over the course of this award, the candidate will gain new skills including in generating snRNA-Seq from cryopreserved lung tissue, in lung stereology, in RNA in situ hybridization, in analysis of complementary genomic datasets, and in incorporation of clinical phenotypic information into genomic analyses. Accomplishing the proposed work will provide a rigorous training program for Dr. Reyfman and will provide insights that could lead to improved therapies for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The studies outlined in this proposal will be essential for future investigations that employ systems biology approaches to investigate the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis or to develop novel biomarkers of disease. This proposal will deepen our understanding of the strengths and limitations of single-cell transcriptomic profiling technology for studying human lung samples during health and disease. These findings may form a foundation for the development of biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of response to therapy in pulmonary fibrosis, and may uncover new targets for therapy.",Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis,10112301,K08HL146943,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alveolar', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Bleomycin', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Cryopreservation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Donor person', 'Drug Exposure', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung Compliance', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Specimen', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'personalized approach', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2021,162792
"Prognostic Markers of Emphysema Progression Project Summary/Abstract Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects up to 24 million people in the United States and is projected to be the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide by 2020 with a total cost of $50 billion. COPD has been traditionally dichotomized into the clinical phenotypes of emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In particular, emphysema is defined as abnormal, permanent dilation of the distal airspaces. The development and progression of this pathologic process are associated with a decline in lung function and progressive clinical impairment. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the chest is increasingly being leveraged to quantify the disease and its progression objectively. Current approaches to quantify emphysema progression are limited and discard most of the spatial and temporal information in CT scans obtained at inspiration and expiration. In this proposal, we plan on developing computational components to prognosticate emphysema progression that builds upon image density markers and lung mechanical strain characteristics conditioned on their underlying emphysema subtypes. This proposal leverages our previous experience in computational emphysema subtyping to discover, validate and translate a novel panel of prognostic markers tailored around the postulated mechanisms of emphysema progression: inflammation injury and mechanical strain. To reach this goals, we will (1) develop an advanced emphysema subtyping approach using novel deep learning architectures, (2) develop a fast mass preserving large displacement registration approach to enable the discovery of local elastic properties of lung tissue between inspiratory and expiration CT scans, (3) discover new subtype-specific biomarker features based on image density relations and mechanical properties using unsupervised deep learning techniques within a common statistical framework, and (4) validate the prognostic value of the proposed biomarkers and their association with decline end-points and clinical outcomes to enable its clinical interpretation and translation. In addition to that, will be explored alternative prognostic models based on advanced machine learning techniques and performed a model comparison study to define the most prognostic model for emphysema progression. Our analysis will process 12,300 scans corresponding to 5,517 subjects with baseline and follow-up data from the COPDGene cohort –one of the largest cohort in COPD containing CT images at inspiration and expiration, respiratory and genetic measurements.

"Prediction of COPD Progression by PRM PROJECT ABSTRACT  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous disorder that afflicts nearly 30 million Americans. Current disease staging and therapy is based primarily on spirometry and clinical characteristics. Due to limitations in the standard phenotyping approaches, patients with similarly staged COPD may exhibit strikingly different progression patterns. Small airways disease (SAD), a treatable but occult component of COPD, is a significant contributor to airflow obstruction manifesting early in COPD. In recent years, SAD has been has been implicated as a precursor to the irreversible destruction of lung parenchyma, i.e. emphysema. The ability to predict if and when SAD will lead to emphysema would have an immediate clinical impact on the care of COPD patients. In 2012 we reported on the Parametric Response Map (PRM) analytical technique that when applied to paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans is capable of simultaneously visualizing and quantifying the extent of “functional” SAD (fSAD) and emphysema in a single COPD patient. Since then we have made three key advances: first, PRM-derived fSAD is predictive of spirometric decline in COPD patients and emphysema development; second, we have validated in human lung samples that PRM- derived fSAD is a measure of small airway narrowing and loss; and finally, applying techniques to capture regional variation of fSAD within the lung, we have enhanced PRM (topological PRM [tPRM]) to provide a more sensitive measure of local disease severity than what is possible with the original PRM concept. Based on our findings, we postulate that PRM, or its advanced form tPRM, has the potential to predict long-term patient progression. The goal of this proposal will be to use baseline, Year 5 and recently available Year 10 COPDGene data to determine the ability of PRM to predict disease progression through three Specific Aims: 1) Characterize PRM-derived fSAD progression patterns over a 5 and 10 year period; 2) Determine how regional differences in disease distribution, as determined by tPRM, identify regional onset of local emphysema; and 3) Apply machine learning strategies to PRM/tPRM and other clinical metrics to develop models that predict patient disease trajectories. It is our expectation that PRM metrics will identify COPD patients at risk for more rapid disease progression but that utilizing regional information and machine learning strategies will further enhance our approach. The results of such analyses could both identify patients appropriate for more intense, targeted therapy at an early disease stage and contribute to our understanding of the progression of small airways disease and emphysema in COPD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  COPD is a highly prevalent but heterogeneous disorder with rising morbidity and mortality with efforts to develop effective treatments have been hampered by an inability to predict disease progression. This study proposes to apply statistical and deep learning strategies to evaluate novel CT-based analytic techniques as predictors of disease course in a COPD patient cohort. The successful outcome of this study will aid physicians in identifying patients for targeted therapies.",Prediction of COPD Progression by PRM,10124429,R01HL150023,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Chronic Care', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'Staging', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cohort', 'concept mapping', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'information model', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'pulmonary function', 'pulmonary function decline', 'regional difference', 'response', 'small airways disease', 'statistical learning', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,686225
"Role of visceral adipose tissue in frailty among patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this application for a 5-year K23 Career Development Award, I propose mentored research and career development leading to a career as an independent clinical and translational investigator in interstitial lung disease (ILD). The goal of this project is to identify the role of body composition in frailty among subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The prevalence of IPF is rising, currently affecting 1 in 200 older adults. There is no cure for IPF. The only available medications slow disease progression but do not reverse disease. Frailty affects up to 50% of IPF patients, and is characterized by decreased physiologic reserve and increased susceptibility to severe manifestations of acute insults. The most common causes of death in IPF are acute insults. Frailty is thus a potentially modifiable risk factor for morbidity and mortality in IPF. This proposal builds on my preliminary work showing that (1) greater visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with increased frailty, (2) subjects with both sarcopenia and visceral obesity are at greater risk of frailty than those with sarcopenia alone, (3) there may be distinct endotypes of exercise limitation defined by high inflammation alone or low inflammation with high VAT, and (4) down-regulation of the growth hormone (GH) axis may link VAT and frailty. Under the mentorship of Dr. R Graham Barr, I propose to evaluate the roles of body composition by bioelectrical impedance assay (co-mentor Gallagher), inflammation, and neuroendocrine dysregulation associated with frailty risk using a machine-learning approach (co-mentor Valeri). I will also evaluate the role of growth hormone axis dysregulation in sarcopenia with visceral obesity in a rigorous overnight protocol (co-mentor Freda). I propose to perform this in two NHLBI-funded prospective cohorts: Dr. Garcia’s Families-At-Risk for ILD (R01HL103676) and Dr. Singer’s Advanced Lung Disease Lung Transplantation Study (R01HL134851). With guidance from my mentors, I have crafted a 5-year career development plan that includes training in body composition analysis (Dr. Gallagher), measurement of complex endocrine systems (Dr. Freda), clinical trials (Dr. Freda), biostatistics (Dr. Valeri), aging in interstitial lung disease (Dr. Garcia), and epidemiology (Dr. Barr). In the last two years of this award, I will apply for R01 funding and transition to independence. The proposed activities will prepare me to conduct patient-oriented research to evaluate the role of body composition in outcomes in ILD. I will also acquire the skills and training required to design and conduct clinical trials targeting novel pathways to prevent and treat frailty in ILD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an increasingly prevalent chronic lung disease with no available cure; frailty affects 50% of IPF patients, and is associated with increased severity of illness in response to acute insults, which are the most common cause of death in IPF. We identified that visceral adipose tissue is a risk factor for frailty and propose to investigate potential mechanisms linking visceral adipose tissue and frailty, as modifiable risk factors for morbidity and mortality in this growing patient population. Our findings may lead to novel therapies and clinical trials evaluating the role of existing medications in the prevention and treatment of frailty in IPF.",Role of visceral adipose tissue in frailty among patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,10442191,K23HL150280,"['Acute', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'American', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Biolectric Impedance', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Body Composition', 'Body mass index', 'Cause of Death', 'Central obesity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hospitalization', 'Inflammation', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Interleukin-1 Receptors', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Societies', 'Somatotropin', 'Somatotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Steroids', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Variant', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'androgenic', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'frailty', 'growth hormone deficiency', 'health related quality of life', 'hormone analog', 'human old age (65+)', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'reduced muscle mass', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'sarcopenic obesity', 'skills training', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'translational approach', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2021,170856
"The gut-lung axis influences the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on gut fungal commensal ecology, the mycobiome, in the neonatal period to advance mechanistic understanding of the gut-lung axis in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This research development plan is designed to provide the candidate, an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and neonatologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with the mentorship, training and research experience required to accelerate his development into an independent clinician scientist in neonatal mucosal immunology. To achieve the candidate’s long-term goal of leading a productive translational research program focused on understanding mucosal immunology in BPD and facilitate his transition to independence, the candidate and his established mentors have devised a comprehensive development plan based on: 1) intensive, personal mentorship from a team with a proven history of productive mentoring; 2) in-depth experiential and focused didactic training to advance his understanding of molecular mycology, gnotobiotics and clinical research methods; and 3) an innovative research plan to produce causal evidence for gut mycobiome involvement in BPD development. The candidate’s research development plan outlines a focused path to obtain the knowledge, skills and experience required to accelerate his development into an independent clinician scientist who will have a lasting impact on neonatal mucosal immunology.  BPD is the most serious pulmonary complication of preterm birth. Treatments to modify developmental risk factors for BPD are lacking. Neonatal models of the gut-lung axis in other lung diseases, epidemiological studies linking antibiotic exposure with increased risk of BPD development, and the candidate’s extensive preliminary studies in mice and preterm newborns strongly suggest the gut mycobiome represents a therapeutic target to influence BPD development. This proposal builds on the candidate’s prior experience and the expertise of his mentors to explore the mechanisms of the neonatal gut-lung axis. We will test two hypotheses. 1) Prenatal antibiotic exposure-induced mycobiome changes drive increased BPD severity by disrupting the gut-lung axis. 2) Colonization with commensal fungi favorably alters the pulmonary mucosal immune response to hyperoxia. Determining if disruption of intestinal commensal microbial communities contributes to the development of lung injury in BPD will inform the development of therapeutics for mitigating BPD. These studies are expected to lay the groundwork translational studies in human preterm newborns. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a devastating chronic lung disease with debilitating long-term consequences, affects approximately half of all infants born extremely preterm. The objectives of this proposal are relevant to public health because they aim to establish that bacterial communities in the gut influence development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia by altering the immune responses of the developing lung. Successful completion of this proposal will provide insight into extra-pulmonary contributions to lung development and characterize new targets for therapy, which addresses goals of the NIH to seek mechanistic understanding of the microbiome in the pathobiology of lung diseases and reduce the incidence of chronic lung disease during early life.",The gut-lung axis influences the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia,10205168,K08HL151907,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alabama', 'Antibiotics', 'Asthma', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complication', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Ecology', 'Education', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperoxia', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lymphoid Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mucosal Immune Responses', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Pediatrics', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career development', 'commensal bacteria', 'critical developmental period', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fungus', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-lung axis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'lung development', 'lung injury', 'member', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome components', 'microbiome composition', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mycobiome', 'neonatal mice', 'neonatal period', 'neonate', 'new therapeutic target', 'pneumonia model', 'pre-clinical', 'prenatal', 'preterm newborn', 'professor', 'protective effect', 'pulmonary function', 'research and development', 'respiratory microbiome', 'screening', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'translational research program', 'translational study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K08,2021,165456
"Validation of an in vitro model of progressive fibrosis that mimics Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Abstract We have developed a 3D bioengineered human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived model of IPF that displays progressive fibrosis and closely phenocopies several characteristics associated with IPF. This model is an extension of our 2D model of progressive fibrosis (Vijayaraj et al., Cell Reports – in press). To make our progressive fibrosis model specific to IPF, we have developed it into a model system that utilizes the lung 3D architecture and specific cell types. Our 3D model displays additional features of IPF such as airway epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and replacement of alveolar architecture. Our proposal aims to improve and validate this 3D model such that it will be amenable to a high throughput drug discovery platform in a patient specific manner for precision medicine. Our project aims to use our unique stem/progenitor cell models of IPF to increase our understanding of the disease and for drug discovery. Specific Aim 1. To improve and validate the 3D bioengineered human iPSC derived model of IPF A. To validate the 3D model of IPF by performing extensive characterization of the model compared to human  IPF lung tissue. B. To characterize the heterogeneity of IPF seen across different patients. C. To characterize the 3D IPF model by known genetic risk factors. Specific Aim 2 – To use our 3D bioengineered iPSC-derived model to study cellular plasticity in IPF To profile cellular plasticity of AECs in our 3D model of IPF and compare it to human IPF tissue using single cell RNA sequencing. Specific Aim 3 – To develop and standardize a high throughput drug screening (HTS) platform to identify new anti-fibrotic therapies using the 3D model of IPF A. To develop a HTS using the 3D model of IPF. B. To develop robust, image analysis pipelines that employ a combination of advanced deep learning  techniques and traditional image processing methods to generate quantitative measures of tissue health. C. To develop and run a pilot HTS to identify small molecules that will perform one or more of the following a)  prevent apoptosis of AEC; b) enhance apoptosis of mesenchymal cells; c) decrease expression of -SMA. Our team includes international experts who study lung biology (Gomperts, UCLA), biology of fibrosis (Vijayaraj, UCLA), an IPF clinician and researcher (Belperio, UCLA), lung pathologist (Wallace, USC), iPSC airway epithelial cell differentiation (Spence, Michigan), single cell RNA seq and analysis (Plath, UCLA), and high throughput drug discovery (Damoiseaux, UCLA) with machine learning algorithms for analysis (Shattuck, UCLA). We are a highly collaborative team that is working together using innovative, patient relevant research approaches to tackle the challenges of modeling IPF to identify new therapies.

"Functional Lung Imaging Using a Single kV CT Acquisition ABSTRACT Venous thromboembolism is a major global health and economic burden with about 10 million cases occurring every year, and a high lifetime risk of 8% after age 45 years. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a venous thromboembolic event associated with high morbidity and mortality, with about 20% incidence of death before diagnosis or shortly thereafter. Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a marked increase in patients presenting with acute pulmonary thromboembolic disease, most likely created when the infectious vasculitis involving the endothelium creates local arterial thrombosis and subsequent lung infarction, with a superimpose hypercoagulable state that promotes clot formation. In these patients, it is increasingly being recognized that pulmonary perfusion abnormalities associated with the lung consolidations and ground-glass opacities are important predictors of poor prognosis. Currently, pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) has become the preferred method for diagnosing PE and planar lung ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy is used in cases when pulmonary CTA is contraindicated. A compelling unmet clinical need is to develop a method for simultaneous pulmonary CTA and parenchymal perfusion assessment without the use of two modalities like CTA and SPECT perfusion in the same patient. In this project, an imaging physics-based deep learning method will be developed to extract the previously overlooked spectral information inherently encoded in the acquired contrast enhanced CT projection data. As a result of this breakthrough, this new spectral CT imaging method, referred to as Deep-En-Chroma, will be developed and validated for perfusion defect quantification in lung parenchyma from the currently available pulmonary CTA. This will be accomplished without the need for any expensive dual energy CT (DECT) hardware upgrades that have been commercialized by major CT manufacturers. In summary, upon the completion of this project, a new functional CT imaging method will have been developed, that in addition to providing the currently available pulmonary CTA images, will also detect perfusion defects in lung parenchyma without the requirement of high-end DECT hardware.

"Robust Clinical Translation of CT Imaging Biomarker in COPD for EBV Patient Selection PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes conditions such as emphysema, is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Although progression of COPD can be slowed through lifestyle changes, the disease is incurable. New treatment/management options emerged recently when the FDA approved endobronchial valves (EBV) as a Breakthrough Device for the treatment of severe COPD. EBVs provide a new treatment pathway but their implantation is associated with morbidity and mortality risks. In addition, not every patient who undergoes implantation has demonstrated the expected benefits from the device. Trial data indicate that imaging data can be used to help identify patients in whom an EBV will be effective, showing specifically that effectiveness increases in patients with heterogeneous COPD with complete fissures in the targeted lobes. The EBV is officially indicated for “severe emphysema in regions of the lung that have little to no collateral ventilation,” but interpretation of these criteria is imprecise and qualitative. The goal of this proposal is to develop more unified, robust, and quantitative criteria that will more successfully identify patients that are likely to respond to EBV implantation. The three most predictive variables identified by clinical trials to date have been the degree of severity of COPD, the heterogeneity of COPD between adjacent lobes and fissure completeness, all of which can be assessed by CT imaging. However, quantification of COPD severity can be confounded by the CT acquisition and reconstruction parameter selections used in the imaging protocol. These can also affect the ability to assess fissure completeness. In addition, traditional measures of COPD severity (i.e. Emphysema score) do not distinguish lung destruction from airtrapping, which may be important in assessing whether a patient is a good candidate for an EBV. In this proposal, we will investigate methods to standardize CT imaging data that would allow for more robust quantitative image analysis and apply the resulting methods to develop a more robust criteria for patient selection for the application of EBV devices. Therefore, our Specific Aims are: (1) To develop methods for robust, quantitative CT estimates of lung density and the Fissure Integrity Score (FIS). This will involve the application of methods to account for differences in CT scanners and acquisition/reconstruction parameters as well as machine learning methods to more accurately assess lung fissure integrity; (2) To develop and test an EBV predictive model using improved measures. Using the improved estimates of lung density and FIS from aim 1, we will develop and test a predictive model that distinguishes EBV responders from non-responders; and (3) To extend the EBV Prediction Model to incorporate additional biomarkers. We will extend the EBV scoring model by investigating other biomarkers that may provide complementary information, such as distinguishing airtrapping from COPD and an assessment of lung vascularity. We evaluate the ability of this extended model to improve our ability to distinguish EBV responders from non-responders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes conditions such as emphysema, is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States.

"Modeling to Design Treatments for Idiopathic Lung Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY Every year in this country 40,000 patients are diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and terminal disease caused by excessive extracellular matrix production by myofibroblasts in distributed lesions, or “fibrotic foci”, throughout the lung. Despite the availability of two FDA-approved drugs that are considered standard of care, the mortality rate for IPF patients exceeds 30% at four years, and there are no drugs that halt disease progression, making diagnosis with IPF a death sentence for over 500,000 Americans living with this disease. Identifying the cells of origin that give rise to myofibroblasts is necessary for finding treatments that can halt or cure IPF. Based on experimental data and computational simulations from our research team, we hypothesize that myofibroblasts arise from microvascular pericytes (cells that normally enwrap capillaries) when heterotypic pericyte-endothelial interactions become disrupted. We further posit that strategic modulation of kinase-mediated signaling in pericytes can prevent pericyte-to-myofibroblast transitions and halt the progression of IPF. We propose to combine computational modeling with experiments to study pericyte-to-myofibroblast differentiation and to investigate how microvessel adaptations in the lung contribute to IPF. Specifically, we will develop a new agent-based model (ABM) that incorporates logic-based intracellular signaling networks to simulate cell behaviors and leverages Bayesian inference for rule refinement (Aim 1), validate the ABM's ability to predict pericyte phenotype transitions and the emergence of fibrotic foci in response to drugs using the murine bleomycin model of IPF (Aim 2), and bridge murine experiments with clinical data in order to predict how druggable kinase-driven signaling pathways affect IPF progression via modulation of pericytes and microvessels (Aim 3). To our knowledge, our proposed studies will be the first to combine computational modeling with experiments to study microvascular contributors to IPF progression. In addition to producing a new computational model that is validated for bridging pre-clinical study results to clinical outcomes, we expect to identify new therapeutic approaches for IPF that target microvascular cells, previously underexplored but potentially critical contributors to this deadly disease.

"Airway Tree Subtyping on Large Cohorts of CT Images for COPD Risk Project Summary / Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) defined by irreversible airflow limitation, is the 3rd leading cause of death globally and 4th in the United States. Smoking tobacco is a major extrinsic COPD risk factor, but despite six decades of declining smoking rates in many countries, the corresponding declines in COPD have been modest. Only a minority of lifetime smokers develop COPD, and up to 25% occurs in never smokers. While other factors have been linked to COPD much of the variation in COPD risk remains unexplained. In addition, personalized risk and therapies are lacking for COPD, due to a lack of reliable COPD subphenotypes. Airflow obstruction, or reduced airflow from the lungs, is determined in part by airway tree structure and lung volume, both of which can be imaged with high precision by high resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) scans. Emerging evidence by our group suggests that airway tree structure variation is common in the general population and is a major contributor to this unexplained COPD risk. By manual labeling of the airway tree structure, limited to one airway generation in just 2 of the 5 lung lobes (due to complexity of tree structure), we found that 26% of the general population has major airway branch variants that differ from the classical “textbook” structure, increase COPD risk, and have a strong and biologically plausible genetic basis. We further demonstrated that airway tree caliber variation (dysanapsis) measured on CT was a stronger predictor of COPD risk than all known risk factors including smoking. Yet there is no standardized approach to characterize the full scope airway tree variation, making the exact relationship between COPD and individual airway-structure features unclear. This proposal would apply for the first-time the power of machine learning methods to the entire airway tree structure imaged on HRCT to build logically upon prior high-impact work to discover new COPD subphenotypes for risk stratification and biological pathways of intervention. Also, we will apply sophisticated / rigorous mathematical clustering approaches to airway trees derived from over 18,000 computed tomography (CT) scans in three highly characterized NIH/NHLBI-funded cohorts – the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Lung Study, the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Study (SPIROMICS), and the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) Study, in addition to the Canadian Cohort of Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) – to discover and replicate novel and clinically significant airway tree subtypes and their genetic basis. The proposed study provides a transformative opportunity to define and validate normal and clinically relevant tree variation in the general population and COPD cohorts. This research would result in robust, reproducible, image based novel quantitative airway tree structure subtypes from lung CT scans, and understand their role in COPD risk, prognosis, and their underlying genetic basis to help personalize COPD risk. Project Narrative For Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD, the 4th cause of death in the USA) defined by irreversible airflow, there is emerging evidence that suggests that variation in airway tree structure is common in the general population and is a major contributor to unexplained COPD risk. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding airway tree structure subtypes from lung CT scans would advance our knowledge of disease susceptibility and improve personalized therapies, prognosis, and identify an underlying genetic basis to COPD risk. Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to fostering fundamental creative discoveries and innovative research strategies as a basis for ultimately protecting health.",Airway Tree Subtyping on Large Cohorts of CT Images for COPD Risk,10299153,R01HL155816,"['3-Dimensional', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Air Movements', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Caliber', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dictionary', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Obstructive Lung Diseases', 'Occupational', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'disorder risk', 'environmental tobacco smoke', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'high standard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lung development', 'lung lobe', 'lung volume', 'machine learning method', 'never smoker', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pollutant', 'prognostic significance', 'pulmonary function decline', 'respiratory', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,681411
"Administrative Supplement: Integrative analysis of lung cancer etiology and risk RFA: PA-18-842 (NOT-CA-20-006) Title: Administrative Supplement: Integrative analysis of lung cancer etiology and risk Project Summary/Abstract Over the past two decades, many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed that most common diseases have a polygenic architecture, wherein multiple genetic variants with small genetic effect cumulatively impact disease development. Advances in statistical, epidemiological, and clinical genetics enable to demonstrate the power of polygenic risk profiles in form of polygenic risk scores to define individuals at high- and low-risk of disease. However, most genetic research carried out to date has focused on genetically homogeneous studies from European populations given the limited availability of samples in populations of diverse ancestry and due to confounding from variability in allelic proportions among diverse populations. This implies that GWAS in ethnic disparities are not fully understood. The goals of this proposal are to leverage genetic diversity to develop and refine PRS by addressing the ancestral diversity in African American population that are not well-represented in genetic research; and to elucidate individual and system-level factors affecting disparities in access and participation of African- Americans in lung cancer genomic testing for polygenic risk, engagement with return of results, and uptake of lung cancer polygenic risk score information in clinical care. We postulate that the ancestry-specific and disease subtypes-specific polygenic models can greatly improve risk prediction to identify high- to low-risk individuals of disease development in terms of prevention and management of the disease. The proposal capitalizes on large-scale existing well-genotyped and phenotype dataset using ancestry-specific, disease subset-based, linkage disequilibrium score regression, and machine-learning association analysis to achieve the a “cancer health disparities” principle and to increase prediction accuracy in African American population. In addition, identifying the individual and system –level factors affecting disparities in lung cancer genomic testing for polygenic risk will inform development of more targeted interventions to improve access, participation, and engagement, which could not only enhance model prediction but also have salutary downstream impact by elucidating strategies to improve African-American engagement in cancer genomic testing.

"Novel Methods for Identifying Genetic Interactions for Cancer Prognosis Project Summary For the prognosis of melanoma, lung cancer, and many other cancers, G-E (gene-environment) interactions have important implications. Through a series of studies, our group has taken a unique robustness perspective and a leading role in developing the foundation of G-E interaction analysis using cutting-edge high-dimensional and regularized statistics. Recently, our group pioneered I-E (histopathological imaging-environment) interaction analysis and significantly expanded the scope of cancer analytics. We have made important discoveries for NHL, melanoma, and lung cancer, impactfully advancing their translational research and clinical practice.  Our overarching goal is to construct more powerful prognosis models and more accurately identify G-E/I- E interactions so as to truthfully describe cancer biology and informatively guide clinical decision-making. In this project, we will be the first to develop paradigm-shifting SDL (statistically principled deep learning) techniques tailored to G-E/I-E interaction analysis for cancer prognosis. The proposed methods will inherit strengths from the existing deep learning and regression techniques and be superior to both. We will continue analyzing data on melanoma and lung cancer, further enhancing the high translational and clinical impact of our study.  We will: (Aim 1) Develop foundational SDL techniques tailored to G-E/I-E interaction analysis. We will first develop “benchmark” nonrobust losses and then innovatively advance to losses that are robust to model mis-specification and long-tailed distribution/contamination. A novel penalization technique will be applied for architecture construction, which will accommodate the unique characteristics of the main G/I effects, main E effects, and their interactions in a customized manner, screen out noises, and respect the “main effects, interactions” hierarchy. (Aim 2) Boost performance by incorporating additional information. We will cost- effectively improve SDL performance by incorporating additional information on (a) the interconnections between prognosis and G-E/I-E interactions as well as main G/I effects, and (b) the interconnections among G/I variables. (Aim 3) Expand analysis scope and integrate multiple types of G/I measurements. Motivated by their overlapping but also independent information for prognosis, we will develop novel SDL methods and be the first to integrate multiple types of molecular and imaging measurements in interaction analysis. (Aim 4) Analyze the Yale SPORE and TCGA data on melanoma and lung cancer. Analysis will be conducted on multiple prognosis outcomes. Demographic/clinical/environmental risk factors, multiple types of molecular measurements (protein, gene expression, mutation, methylation, and microRNA), and histopathological imaging features will be analyzed. The analysis results will be thoroughly and rigorously evaluated, extensively compared to those using alternatives, and validated in multiple ways. Project Narrative Built on the uniquely strong foundation our group has established, this study will be the first to systematically and comprehensively develop paradigm-shifting SDL (statistically principled deep learning) techniques for G-E (gene-environment) and I-E (histopathological imaging-environment) interaction analysis for cancer prognosis. The analysis of the Yale SPORE and TCGA data on melanoma and lung cancer will deliver prognosis model with superior prediction performance and new markers with sound biological interpretations, further advancing translational research and better informing clinical practice.",Novel Methods for Identifying Genetic Interactions for Cancer Prognosis,10311368,R01CA204120,"['Architecture', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Inherited', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Prevention', 'Prognosis', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'gene environment interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'melanoma', 'molecular imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'screening', 'sound', 'statistics', 'therapy development']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,397813
"Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality for participants screened with low-dose CT (LDCT) as opposed to chest X-ray. Based largely on these findings, LDCT lung screening is now a covered service for 8.7 million high-risk current and former smokers in the United States. For high-risk individuals younger than 65, insurance coverage is mandated under the Affordable Care Act; for those 65 and over screening is covered by Medicare. Medicare covers lung screening only if patients are enrolled in a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-approved lung screening registry. The American College of Radiology Lung Cancer Screening Registry (ACR-LCSR) is the only registry currently approved by CMS. Although most medical societies have endorsed CT for lung cancer screening, the American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend either for or against lung screening, as the results of the NLST had not been replicated in a community setting. Concerns regarding the dissemination of lung screening focus on 1) the high rate of false positive (FP) screens, for which participants receive a positive screening result and require additional testing, but do not have lung cancer, 2) the relatively high rate of potentially clinically important significant incidental findings (SIFs) detected at lung screening that are unrelated to lung cancer, and 3) potential harms from the diagnostic evaluation of these FP and SIF abnormalities. It is unclear whether the rate of FPs and SIFs seen in the NLST, will be replicated in community practice, as opposed to a clinical trial setting. Higher rates of FPs and SIFs in the community or inefficient diagnostic evaluation may result in delayed cancer diagnosis, excessive testing, iatrogenic complications due to unnecessary testing, or decreased cost-effectiveness of lung screening in the community, as opposed to the NLST. For the proposed research, we plan to: 1) compare the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer and the rate and type of SIFs in the ACR-LCSR community registry data as opposed to the NLST, 2) compare the diagnostic pathways used to assess these abnormalities in the community as opposed to the NLST, and 3) use a decision-tree cost-effectiveness analysis to compare community lung screening with NLST cost-effectiveness assumptions with respect to rates of lung and SIF abnormalities and diagnostic pathways; and to identify most cost-effective diagnostic pathways for each type of abnormality. This information is of vital importance to ensure that the reduction in lung cancer mortality reported by the NLST is achieved in the community setting. The goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of lung screening in community practice with that reported in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with respect to the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer, the rate and type of significant incidental findings that are seen on lung screening and may be clinically important, but that are not related to lung cancer, and the diagnostic testing that is done to evaluate lung and other abnormalities. We will use this information to compare the cost effectiveness of community lung screening with that estimated from the NLST and provide information that can be used to enhance the effectiveness of lung screening in the community.",Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness,10165656,R01CA215240,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affordable Care Act', 'American', 'American College of Radiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family Physicians', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Nodule', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Policy Maker', 'Preventive service', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'community setting', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data registry', 'former smoker', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'participant enrollment', 'patient screening', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'tv watching']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,509518
"Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening. However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.  The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3) validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams and in follow up exams. Narrative: Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. If successful, we will have developed an automated low dose CT-based quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) which can be included as an independent factor to improve the diagnosis of screening detected nodules. It will not only provide a useful imaging biomarker to assist in lung nodule management for individuals, but also constitute a strong foundation to meet our long-term goal of developing clinically- translatable decision support system (DSS) to facilitate personalized medicine in early detection of lung cancer, optimizing treatment strategies and reducing health care costs",Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer,10164728,U01CA216459,"['Advocate', 'Anxiety', 'Archives', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lobectomy', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nodule', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Screening Result', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'automated image analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically translatable', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effectiveness validation', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'screening program', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,455832
"Individually-tailored clinical decision support for management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION) The rollout of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening programs is accelerating in the United States, aiming for earlier detection of lung cancer to improve long-term survival. However, a consequence of such imaging programs is the increased discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). Significant ques- tions remain around the effective management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs: while many are benign, a fraction will go on to become cancerous. Diagnostic models for IPNs and associated management guidelines have been described previously, but their real-world validation is limited. Moreover, the majority of models only use a “snapshot” of the IPN at a single point in time and fail to take into consideration progressive changes. Opportunities now exist to advance such predictive models by encompassing the patient's evolving medical history, combining clinical and imaging biomarkers to improve prediction and individually-tailor the management of IPNs over time. The objective of this imaging informatics proposal is the development of a clinical decision support tool for the management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs. We address two key challenges: 1) the development of a continuous-time model for predicting how the IPN will evolve; and 2) the use of this prediction to determine a series of actions over time that will optimize (screening) outcomes for the individual. We first explore the devel- opment of a continuous time belief network (CTBN), a temporal probabilistic model to predict the likelihood of a patient to develop lung cancer. Unlike traditional approaches, CTBNs do not require fixed sampling frequency of the data over time (e.g., all observations made annually) and are thus more amenable to real-world clinical settings and observational datasets. The probabilities computed through the CTBN are subsequently input into a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to guide IPN management decisions. From the POMDP, policies (sequences of actions over time) can be chosen to achieve a desired goal (e.g., minimizing time to diagnosis), given past and current observations/decisions for an individual. For both the CTBN and POMDP, we explore novel methods in the design and implementation, overcoming computational challenges to realize translation of these models into practice. A web-based interface is implemented, providing a clinical de- cision making tool for physicians to understand the models' recommendations. Evaluation focuses on assessing the performance of the CTBN and POMDP relative to known outcomes and compared to other conventional methods (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, dynamic belief networks); as well as the overall impact of the system to influence decision-making. This effort advances our past research in probabilistic models and capital- izes on expertise in lung cancer screening, including past leadership of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The result of this effort will be a set of informatics-driven modeling tools and new temporal predictive models informing IPN management. PROGRAM NARRATIVE Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening is being implemented nationwide, aiming to reduce mortality due to lung cancer. But questions have been raised regarding false positives, with concerns about the attendant discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) and their ensuing long-term surveillance.

"Lung Cancer Screening via Ultrasensitive and Cost-efficient Analysis of Tumor DNA Signatures in Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Substantial improvements in cancer survival rates could be achieved by developing better tools to detect occult malignancies at an earlier, more curable stage. Unfortunately, efforts to identify serum protein biomarkers that are sufficiently cancer-specific to be used for screening have found little success. Here, we pursue an alternative strategy based on detection of exceptionally tumor-specific mutant DNA fragments in the circulation of patients with early-stage lung cancer. Because these tumor-derived DNA fragments harbor genetic signatures that would be uncommon in healthy individuals, they hold great promise for screening applications where a high frequency of false-positive results would be unacceptable. However, it is a formidable challenge to create an assay that is able to detect trace quantities of mutant DNA released into the bloodstream from a small, early-stage tumor, without knowing the tumor’s mutation profile beforehand. Additional challenges are posed by economic factors as well as the presence of low-level mutations in the healthy population. To address these challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with highly complementary expertise from Microsoft Research and from Yale, Rice, and Harvard Universities. In this proposal, we describe innovative solutions in which we apply tools of biochemistry, thermodynamics, machine learning, and biostatistics to develop and validate an ultrasensitive, cost-efficient assay for detecting rare mutant DNA fragments in blood as markers of early-stage lung cancer.

"Development of a Novel Lung Function Imaging Modality for comprehensive management of lung cancer Our project proposes an academic-industrial partnership to translate a novel lung function imaging modality into clinical care for lung cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. Lung cancer patients being treated with radiation can experience serious and sometimes life threatening thoracic side effects from treatment. There is emerging data demonstrating that a novel lung function imaging modality can reduce side-effects and improve quality of life for lung cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. The novel lung function imaging modality, referred to as ‘4DCT-ventilation,’ uses 4DCT data along with image processing techniques to innovatively calculate lung ventilation maps. 4DCT-ventilation can improve outcomes for lung cancer patients by enabling the generation of functional avoidance radiotherapy plans. Functional avoidance uses 4DCT-ventilation to avoid functional portions of the lung, with the hypothesis that reducing dose to functional lung will reduce thoracic side- effects. Our 4DCT-ventilation research has progressed from retrospective studies to an early-phase trial using 4DCT-ventilation for functional avoidance radiotherapy. The early promising toxicity results from 4DCT- ventilation clinical trials is providing a strong rationale for national trials and expanded clinical integration across individual clinics. The problem is that expanded clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation is currently not possible due to a lack of consistent, efficient, and clinically validated methods. We propose an academic-industry partnership with MIM Software to address these challenges precluding clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation.  The purpose of our study is to develop methods that enable safe, efficient, and clinically validated methods for clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance. Our overarching hypothesis is that the 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance innovations we develop will be demonstrated to reduce lung toxicity in clinics with no prior 4DCT-ventilation experience. The project will be carried out in 3 aims. Aim 1 will develop methods that enable automated 4DCT-ventilation calculations including auto-segmentation, statistically-robust calculation methods, and clinically-efficient quality assurance tools. Aim 2 will develop methods for 4DCT- ventilation functional avoidance radiotherapy including image heterogeneity assessment, development of knowledge-based functional planning methods, and evaluation of metrics most critical in reducing toxicity. In conjunction with our industry partner, the developed methods from Aims 1 and 2 will be integrated in a commercial-grade software tool. Aim 3 will evaluate feasibility by assessing whether 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance can be demonstrated to reduce toxicity in clinics with no prior 4DCT-ventilation experience.  Our project will generate both the tools and data needed to provide guidance on how to properly incorporate 4DCT-ventilation into clinical care. The methods and data will culminate in a commercial-grade platform suitable for busy clinics. 4DCT-ventilation has great potential to improve outcomes for lung cancer patients and our project will enable the integration of this novel imaging modality into clinical care.

"Macro-vasculature: A Novel Image Biomarker of Lung Cance ABSTRACT  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and worldwide. The high mortality associated with lung cancer is in part due to underutilization of and limited access to lung cancer screening that impedes early diagnosis. The apprehension of some clinicians and policymakers towards lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) exams is based on concerns of lead-time bias and high false-positive rate. The development of a robust lung cancer biomarker that reduces screen-detected false positives and improves classification of indeterminate nodules would relieve some of the concerns related to lung cancer screening. Although investigations show that screening with LDCT scans may reduce lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to chest x-ray, it is reported that ~96% of suspicious findings (mostly indeterminate nodules) turn out to be non-cancerous (false positives). Clinical management of screen-detected indeterminate nodules often leads to unnecessary, costly, and potentially harmful follow-up procedures (e.g., follow-up CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT exam, invasive biopsies). We have developed an exciting and novel image-based macro-vasculature feature to discriminate benign from malignant nodules. We propose to further develop the feature and validate it across a range of CT protocols and scans from other institutions. We will also integrate the macro-vasculature features with clinical information (e.g., age, gender, smoking history, lung function) and evaluate the model's ability to discriminate benign from malignant screen-detected indeterminate nodules. We will investigate if a radiologist's classification of indeterminate nodules improves with the output of the integrative model compared to classification without the integrative model. The success of this project may lead to a novel and robust lung cancer biomarker to accurately assess screen-detected indeterminate nodules that can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up procedures during lung cancer screening. Project Narrative: We propose to investigate the role of the macro-vasculature surrounding indeterminate lung nodules depicted on CT images to discriminate screen-detected benign and malignant nodules. The goal is to improve lung cancer screening by reducing the number of unnecessary procedure associate the high rate of false positive detections.",Macro-vasculature: A Novel Image Biomarker of Lung Cance,10084850,R01CA237277,"['Administrator', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Colon', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nodule', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking History', 'Spiculate', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'chest computed tomography', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'demographics', 'density', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'longitudinal database', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pulmonary function', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,411709
"Macro-vasculature: A Novel Image Biomarker of Lung Cancer ABSTRACT Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and worldwide despite advances in early detection, treatment, and smoking cessation programs. It was reported by the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) that screening with low dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans may reduce lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to chest x-ray. This conclusion ultimately led to the approval and reimbursement for lung cancer screening using LDCT among asymptomatic adults with a history of tobacco smoking. However, LDCT-based screening often results in a large number of indeterminate nodules that later turn out to be non-cancerous. With increasing implementation of LDCT-based lung cancer screening in the U.S., the detection of indeterminate lung nodules during lung cancer screening is likely to increase. To reduce unnecessary diagnostic procedures, such as follow-up CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT exam, and invasive biopsies, a tool that can easily and accurately assess the malignancy and invasiveness of the indeterminate findings will be a welcomed addition to clinical practice. Different levels of invasiveness typically indicate different treatment plans and can often predict the treatment outcome. Compared to the investigative efforts dedicated to discriminating benign from malignant nodules, very limited effort has been focused on assessing the invasiveness of the suspicious nodules and explore the underlying factors associated with invasiveness. We proposed to develop and validate a novel computer tool to non-invasively assess the invasiveness of adenocarcinomas using LDCT scans from a large and diverse lung cancer database with pathology outcome. We will investigate and identify how image-based features contribute to invasiveness. Our exciting preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of developing and implementing such a tool and its highly translational potential. We believe that our computer tool will be a tremendously useful addition to the clinical practice of lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. Its availability will: (1) enable a timely and accurate diagnosis of lung cancer, (2) limit the need for further imaging, biopsies, and possible surgery, and (3) facilitate an optimal selection of the treatment approach (e.g., surgical resection or radiotherapy). Ultimately, we want to improve survival and the quality of life of lung cancer patients. Project Narrative:  We propose to develop and validate a novel computer tool to non-invasively assess lung cancer invasiveness via low-dose CT.

"Lineage heterogeneity and plasticity in lung cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Large-scale genomic studies have discovered numerous relevant alterations that activate or inactivate key signaling molecules in lung cancer, which led to significant improvement on patients' outcome and our therapeutic options. Despite these advances in the genome-based precision medicine, the 5-year survival rate of 18% remains less than adequate. This is attributable to eventual emergence of resistance and variability in response to the treatment, largely due to heterogeneity of lung cancers. To improve precision and efficacy, innovative strategies to distinguish different subgroups of lung cancer by additional features for future drug development are desperately needed. We hypothesize that our natural system to populate necessary cells to constitute the organ structure and its function is hijacked by cancer mimicking normal cell identities to maintain their survival. Our previous studies found lung cancer cells harboring amplification of lineage oncogenes are specifically dependent on their expression for survival. The need for lineage amplified genes in a subset of cancers suggests unique vulnerabilities in cancer cells that may be poised at the brink of survival. However, these amplifications represent only a minor subset of the two major subtypes of lung cancers. Therefore, this study will focus on lineage factors essential during the development and control the cell identity in adult, in the remaining subsets of lung cancers. Through genome-wide profiling of a histone mark, we identified `super- enhancers' (SE) on the lineage-defining transcription factor genes. Subsequent hierarchical clustering of lung cancer samples identified SEs specific to subsets of lung cancers. Therefore, we aim to understand the significance of our lead candidates defining the lineage state of the novel subsets in aim 1. We will test the subclass-specific local chromatin structure and then investigate the roles of novel lineage transcription factors specifically enriched in the two major subgroups of lung ADCs, whether they are essential for maintaining the cellular state of lung cancer cells and are dependent on the committed lineage for their survival. In aim 2, to determine the roles of a neural transcription factor Brn2 in a novel `neural' subtype of lung squamous cell cancers (SCC) as a cooperative partner of Sox2, by contrast to p63, a key squamous lineage factor we previously characterized as an important cooperative partner of Sox2 in classic lung SCC. In aim 3, to pursue inducing transdifferentiation as a therapeutic strategy, we seek to understand how lineage switch occurs within a tumor by determining heterogeneity and dynamics of lineage states. We will determine the mode of temporal dynamics of population shifts in lineage states induced by genetic perturbation in defined models via profiling genome-wide chromatin landscapes at a single cell level. We will then test our hypothesis that the degree of heterogeneity correlates with plasticity of the tumor and aggressive tumor behaviors using a mouse model and human specimens. The results will serve as a proof-of-principle how these lineage factors contribute to the formation of lung cancer and lead to new hypotheses how we can manipulate cell identity of lung cancers.

"The benefits and harms of lung cancer screening in Florida PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in both men and women in the United States. Currently, approximately 70% of lung cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, and the 5-year survival rate of advanced stage lung cancer is very low, at only 16%. Investigators have been searching for effective screening modalities for the early detection of lung cancer so that patients can receive curative treatments at an early stage. When the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated the effectiveness of using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan for lung cancer screening (LCS), researchers and physicians hope to save lives from lung cancer by screening high-risk population who aged 55 to 77 years and have a 30 pack years making history or former smokes who have quitted within the past 15 years. Since the release of the landmark NLST results, many medical associations published guidelines to recommend LDCT-based screening for individuals at high risk for lung cancer and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also decided to cover the LCS for Medicare beneficiaries who are at high risk for lung cancer. While many efforts have been made to accelerate the dissemination the beneficial LCS, the concerns over the high false positive rates (96.4% of the positive results), invasive diagnostic procedures, postprocedural complications and health care costs may hinder the utilization of lung cancer screening. This concern was magnified as researchers and policy makers started questioning whether the complication rate and false positives in real-world settings would be even higher than the rates reported in the NLST, which was conducted in a setting with well-established facilities and proficiency in cancer care. Therefore, we propose to understand the contemporary use of lung cancer screening and associated health care outcomes and costs using data from a real-world setting. Our study has three goals: 1) to develop an innovative computable phenotype algorithm to identify high-risk and low-risk individuals for LCS from both structured and unstructured (i.e., clinical notes) electronic health record (EHR) data and to develop advanced natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract LCS related clinical information from clinical notes such as radiology reports; 2) to determine the appropriate and inappropriate use of LDCT among high-risk and low-risk individuals in Florida and to examine the test results of LDCT, the rates of invasive diagnostic procedures, postprocedural complications, and incidental findings in real-world settings; and 3) to develop and validate a microsimulation model of the clinical courses of LCS incorporating the real-world data in LCS to estimate the long-term benefits and the cost-effectiveness of LCS. Our proposed study has the potential to reduce lung cancer incidence and mortality by informing policymakers and practitioners on the appropriateness of contemporary use of LCS. This knowledge will help both patients and physicians better understand the harm- benefit tradeoff of lung cancer screening and transform such knowledge into practice to prevent avoidable postprocedural complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lung cancer screening using Low-dose computed tomography is a promising technique to reduce the burden of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Concerns over high false positives, invasive diagnostic procedures, postprocedural complications, and downstream health care costs impede developing and promoting lung cancer screening program.

"Identifying Metabolic Vulnerabilities in Lung Cancer OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY IDENTIFYING METABOLIC VULNERABILITIES IN LUNG CANCER Lung Cancer is the most common cause of cancer deaths world-wide. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy have been shown to be effective in a subset of patients; however, the overall survival rate for this disease remains low especially for metastatic disease. Moreover, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients have a poor prognosis, and there especially exists a gap in knowledge in understanding SCLC and identifying effective therapeutic strategies. Our goal in this proposal is to understand the underlying biology of key drivers in lung cancer by identifying metabolic vulnerabilities that can ultimately be used as single agents or combined with immunotherapy to target lung cancer therapeutically. We will achieve this goal by engaging experts that have developed preclinical models with common molecular signatures in non-small cell (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and cutting-edge metabolomics. We have an active and collaborative group that meets twice monthly with projects and manuscripts that are co-authored by the leaders of each project and core. Additionally, our Program Project Grant (PPG) team is located at Moffitt Cancer Center, which is an ideal place to study the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Florida is number 2 in the country in terms of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients. Moffitt treats 10% of these cases. The PPG consists of four projects and four cores. These projects and cores collaborate and synergize to meet four objectives: i. To identify metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancers through integrative analysis of in vivo and ex vivo models with common molecular signatures, including p53, NRF2/KEAP1, and MYC (Project #1, led by Dr. Flores, Project #2, led by Dr. DeNicola, Project #3, led by Drs. Cleveland and Haura, and Project #4, led by Dr. Rodriguez with support from the Administrative Core #1, led by Drs. Flores and Haura, Preclinical Models and Pathology Core #2, led by Drs. Cress and Karreth, Metabolism Core #3, led by Dr. Koomen, and Data Science Core #4, led by Dr. Fridley), ii. To identify metabolic vulnerabilities that synergize with immunotherapy through examining the tumor microenvironment and gaining a deep molecular understanding of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). (Project #4 in collaboration with Projects #1 and #2 and Core #2), iii. To build mouse models as a platform to understand the metabolic pathways utilized by lung cancers with different genetic signatures and to assess therapeutic strategies for lung cancer. (Core #2 supporting Projects #1-4), and iv. To share resources and data locally and globally to obtain an integrated molecular understanding of metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer. (Core #4 leading efforts from All Projects and Cores). OVERALL PROJECT NARRATIVE IDENTIFYING METABOLIC VULNERABILITIES IN LUNG CANCER Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and common therapy for both NSCLC and SCLC includes surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Many of the driver genes mutated in lung cancer are transcription factors and are difficult to target therapeutically and have been dubbed “undruggable”. Our goal in this application is to develop a deep molecular understanding of the metabolic pathways regulated by key drivers in lung cancer using sophisticated and novel mouse models of lung cancer, patient derived samples and organoids, and state-of-the-art approaches in the analysis of metabolites to identify metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer as potential therapeutic targets.",Identifying Metabolic Vulnerabilities in Lung Cancer,10171098,P01CA250984,"['Address', 'Biology', 'Brassicaceae', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Cysteine', 'Cysteine Metabolism Pathway', 'Data', 'Data Science Core', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug resistance', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuscripts', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutate', 'Myeloid-derived suppressor cells', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organoids', 'PERK kinase', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prognosis', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Radiation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'TP53 gene', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'chemotherapy', 'data repository', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'experimental study', 'genetic signature', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung small cell carcinoma', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapeutically effective', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,H.

"Addressing racial disparities in lung cancer screening PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Screening promotes early detection of cancer to decrease mortality. Unfortunately, significant racial disparities exist in lung cancer screening. Recently published findings by our team show that under current national screening guidelines African Americans have reduced eligibility for lung cancer screening compared to whites. These screening guidelines are based on a combination of age and smoking pack-year criteria derived from a national lung screening trial that was primarily (91%) white. Importantly, smoking behaviors and baseline risks for lung cancer differ greatly between African Americans and whites. Because of this, a risk-based screening strategy may provide a more equitable assessment of eligibility than current screening guidelines. However, the development of personalized risk prediction models for lung cancer in African Americans has been limited. To address this gap and to improve equity in screening eligibility, we propose building a personalized prediction tool using the combined data from three large-scale population-based prospective cohorts with substantial African American representation. The combined cohorts have over 336,000 individuals (44% African American) and 9,132 incident lung cancer cases from across the United States. We propose the following three aims: 1) construct a well-calibrated natural-history model of lung cancer risk for screening in African Americans, 2) evaluate lung cancer screening strategies by simulation and identify sub-populations who would benefit from screening, accounting for comorbidities and false-positives, and 3) develop a web-based decision aid for screening that is culturally appropriate. We will employ innovative machine learning techniques and state-of-the- art statistical methods to build a well-calibrated lung cancer prediction model for African Americans. Careful examination will identify sub-populations (such as women, low socioeconomic status, rural, age groups, etc.) that will benefit from screening. A key innovative aspect of this proposal is its community-engaged approach and partnership with a Community Advisory Board, both of which will help translate our empirical findings into the design of a patient-oriented decision aid. This project is relevant to the mission of the National Cancer Institute since it focuses on establishing equity in lung cancer screening eligibility. Our findings will have sustained impact on precision health and motivate improved clinical strategies for the early detection of lung cancer for African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current eligibility guidelines for lung cancer screening exclude a greater percentage of high-risk African Americans than whites. To remedy this, we will build a lung cancer risk prediction model for African Americans and use the new model to identify racially equitable screening strategies in the US population. Finally, we will produce a web-based tool to aid personalized risk prediction at shared decision-making visits to equitably help African Americans assess whether lung screening is desired.",Addressing racial disparities in lung cancer screening,10210043,R01CA251758,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Focus Groups', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Natural History', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Preventive service', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Screening for cancer', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking History', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'black women', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer risk', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'community engagement', 'comorbidity', 'data harmonization', 'design', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'lung cancer screening', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multi-ethnic', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'racial diversity', 'real world application', 'risk prediction model', 'rural area', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'shared decision making', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'study population', 'tool', 'urban area', 'web-based tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,658582
"Novel Integrative Approach for the Early Detection of Lung Cancer using Repeated Measures PROJECT SUMMARY Early detection of lung cancer among asymptomatic individuals is a priority for reducing mortality of the number one cancer killer worldwide. Most lung cancers are first detected as indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). While the vast majority of IPNs are benign, those malignant ones present with specific features that should allow for the early discrimination and intervention. We have recently completed a study demonstrating the value of structural imaging features analysis in providing improved accuracy in detection of cancers among IPNs with accuracy of over 90% trained in the NLST and validated in two independent cohorts. The AUC increased from baseline risk estimate of disease using clinical parameters (Mayo model) 0.78 to 0.84 and from 0.82 to 0.92 in two independent validation cohorts. Similarly, we tested the added value of our high sensitivity hsCYFRA 21-1 assay in three populations of lung nodules and obtained similar added value to the MAYO model. Finally, we identified signatures predictive of lung cancer using large scale data mining in the electronic health record (EHR). The performance of the performance of the established imaging predictor, hsCYFRA concentrations and EHR trajectories will be validated in a prospective cohort. In an innovative partnership between pulmonary oncology, radiology, machine learning, and data science experts at Vanderbilt, we propose to integrate the layer of clinical information accessible in the EHR to improve the noninvasive diagnosis accuracy. In addition, we propose to take advantage of repeated measures to improve the accuracy of the prediction of cancer and to reduce the time to diagnosis. We therefore propose the following aims. In Aim 1 we will validate advanced quantitative imaging analyses to distinguish early benign from malignant IPNs based on repeated measures of 1000 individuals. In Aim 2. We will test in 150 individuals with lung nodules the added value of repeated measures of hsCYFRA 21- 1 protein blood biomarker in diagnostic accuracy over the baseline concentrations of the biomarker. In Aim 3 we will test a deep learning strategy from the EHR of 20,000 patients from VUMC to identify patterns likely to improve the early detection of lung cancer, and in Aim 4 we will test the added value of monitoring changes in levels of the markers for early detection using repeated pre-diagnosis chest CT studies, serum analysis of hsCYFRA 21- 1, and EHR patterns from our lung cancer screening program. Built upon strong preliminary data and unique resources from VUMC that include access to large imaging and HER data sources this novel integrative study has the potential to generate highly impactful and translatable results to reduce false positive rates among IPNs, and morbidity and mortality from lung cancer. This application responds to PAR 19-264 using low-dose lung screening computed tomography longitudinal analysis integrated with a lead serum biomarker and the power of artificial intelligence to mine the EHR for the discovery of a novel integrative strategy for the early detection of premetastatic lung cancer. NARRATIVE Most lung cancers present as pulmonary nodules; so, to improve survival from lung cancer, we need to identify with noninvasive strategies the disease early among a majority of benign nodules. This project focuses on establishing an integrative approach to early detection leveraging repeated measures of chest CT imaging features of lung nodules over time, of the rate of change of a high sensitivity blood biomarker hsCYFRA 21-1, and of longitudinal clinical patterns from the electronic health record. This research will inform the management of lung nodules identified on lung cancer screening CT scans, and should reduce the time to diagnosis and the mortality of lung cancer.",Novel Integrative Approach for the Early Detection of Lung Cancer using Repeated Measures,10069919,R01CA253923,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Markers', 'Community Hospitals', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nodule', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Radiation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Study of serum', 'Testing', 'Thoracotomy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biological specimen archives', 'biomedical informatics', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computed tomography screening', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early detection biomarkers', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'machine learning method', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'premalignant', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'rate of change', 'research clinical testing', 'screening program', 'serial imaging']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,682056
"Lung cancer in East Africa and the relationship to HIV-1 infection: epidemiology, molecular characterization and imaging The molecular epidemiology of lung cancer in Africa is almost completely unknown, yet molecular profiling and institution of targeted therapy is now standardly used to influence care in patients with actionable mutations. HIV- infection is associated with a markedly increased risk of lung cancer, but its association with lung cancer and how it influences disease outcomes is not well studied. The capacity to correctly diagnose lung cancer on radiological images, tissue specimen acquisition, and subsequent histologic confirmation compounds the problem of under and misdiagnosis of lung cancer in Africa, especially with the prevalence and often presumptive clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis infection. In this consortium proposal, we therefore seek to address the above stated problems by 1) establishing national lung cancer diagnostic referral networks in Uganda and Tanzania, which will allow for improved detection of lung cancer and, hence decrease the lung cancer burden; 2) investigating the role of HIV-1 infection on the incidence and outcomes of lung cancer in the region; 3) determining the molecular profile of lung cancer in East African countries in order to facilitate advocacy for scale- up of targeted therapies (including immune-based therapies); 4) building capacity for lung cancer diagnosis and care in terms of improving imaging, pathology, radiology and tissue acquisition and clinical care of lung cancer 5) creating a lung cancer research collaboration that will build capacity through mentoring of junior researchers for future leadership in the field. At the end of this project, we envision an African-led lung cancer research network, clinical expertise for sample acquisition and care, improved pathology and radiology diagnostics services, a lung cancer screening program, and a large biorepository that should support lung cancer research in the region for many years to come. We propose to study lung cancer in Uganda and Tanzania and the relationship to HIV-1 infection through three project-based and three cores. The results of these studies of the epidemiology, molecular characterization and imaging of lung cancer and the relationship to HIV infection will lead to technological transfer of instrumentation to characterize lung cancer and artificial intelligence algorithms to aid in discerning pulmonary granulomatous disease from lung cancer on radiological imaging. Findings herein may lead to the development of country-specific guidelines in the evaluation and management of lung cancer.","Lung cancer in East Africa and the relationship to HIV-1 infection: epidemiology, molecular characterization and imaging",10267194,U54CA254566,"['Address', 'Advocacy', 'Africa', 'African', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Granulomatous', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lung', 'Lung Capacity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Tanzania', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'actionable mutation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'lung cancer screening', 'lung imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'scale up', 'screening program', 'targeted treatment']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U54,2021,990912
"Evaluating Etiological Impact of Metatranscriptomic and Immunological Features for Lung Cancer ABSTRACT There is increasing evidence that the evolution of cancer is strongly dependent on the complex tumor microenvironment (TME) in which it develops. Despite the important roles of both microbiota and immune cells within TME, there are huge gaps in linking specific lung-residing microbiota changes with immune cell subpopulations. To date, no human lung cancer studies have been performed to characterize the host-pathogen dynamic changes and dissecting the microbiome-immune interaction in an integrated manner. We hypothesize that the dysbiosis of lung-residing microbe (microbiota expression changes) triggers dysregulated balance in the lung immune system (immune cells infiltration levels), which results in an inflammatory TME, and further promotes lung tumorigenesis and tumor progression. We propose to capitalize on existing RNA-Seq (tumor and adjacent tissue) from 200 early-stage (I–IIIA) lung adenocarcinoma patients, from a Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) study (discovery, n = 100) and a Harvard School of Public Health study (external validation, n = 100), with no cost to this application. Our goal is to reveal the impact of the lung microbiota on host immune cell profiles and how their interaction contributes to tumorigenesis and tumor progression. To accomplish our goals, we will utilize a Dual RNA-Seq analytical approach: 1) to identity intratumoral metatranscriptomic signatures, and 2) to characterize immune infiltration profiles and microbiome- immune interaction. Specifically, the unmapped quality-filtered RNA reads (non-human, putative microbial reads) aligned to microbial reference transcriptomes will be used for metatranscriptome analysis (Aim 1); whereas reads that map to human reference will be used for computational immune profiling analysis (Aim 2). This is the first study to simultaneously profile lung tissue-specific microbiota expression and immune infiltrates in lung adenocarcinoma. This project could contribute significantly to our understanding of the biological processes before/during (adjacent/tumor tissue) lung adenocarcinoma development, in particular the complex microbiome-immune interaction. Elucidating the nature of interactions between lung microbiome and immune cells comprising the TME could guide the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Public Health Relevance With the advent of low-dose computed tomography screening, more early-stage lung cancers are being diagnosed and there is a need to understand the biology of the disease better. The goal of this project is to reveal the impact of the lung microbiota on host immune cell profiles and how their interaction contributes to tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Clinically, our findings may benefit the identification of lung cancer patients at high risk of tumor recurrence after surgery and could potentially support the selection of subgroups of patients for future personalized cancer therapies (such as immunotherapy).",Evaluating Etiological Impact of Metatranscriptomic and Immunological Features for Lung Cancer,10290463,R03CA262911,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammatory', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Public Health Schools', 'RNA', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Smoking', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'T memory cell', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-associated macrophages', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Validation', 'base', 'college', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'design', 'differential expression', 'dysbiosis', 'epidemiologic data', 'high risk', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung microbiome', 'lung microbiota', 'lung tumorigenesis', 'metatranscriptome', 'metatranscriptomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'public health relevance', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R03,2021,80000
"Real-Time Bronchoscope Localization Using Machine Learning To Improve Lung Cancer Diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer 5-year survival rates drop from 61% for early stage diagnosis to just 6% for late stage diagnosis. Currently, fewer than 1 in 5 cases are diagnosed at an early stage. The increasing frequency of chest CT scans and changes in lung cancer screening guidelines are expected to increase the number of incidentally discovered lung lesions, representing an opportunity for earlier lung cancer diagnosis. Bronchoscopy is currently the safest, least invasive, and least expensive diagnostic option, but its poor diagnostic yield greatly limits its procedural beneﬁt. Even when advanced techniques like radial endobronchial ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation are used, the diagnostic yield is just 50-60%. This is primarily due to challenges with intraoperative localization of the bronchoscope prior to needle deployment. Additionally, access to these techniques is limited because they require expensive equipment and unique expertise. Efforts relying on the bronchoscope's built-in camera require no additional equipment or specialization, but have struggled with generalizability across individuals in part due to limited data availability and assumptions about airway features.  The objective of this proposal is to improve the success rate of traditional bronchoscopes by addressing limita- tions in intraoperative localization using a data-driven model that is robust to differences in human anatomy. This work has potential for signiﬁcant public health beneﬁt by (1) increasing early lung cancer detection, (2) reducing morbidity and mortality by reducing the number of invasive procedures, and (3) making minimally invasive bron- choscopy more accessible in areas without expert bronchoscopists. The proposed work will be accomplished via two Speciﬁc Aims. In Aim 1, a dataset will be generated of virtual and real bronchoscopy videos with video-frame matched six degrees-of-freedom poses (position and orientation in three-dimensions) of the bronchoscope's dis- tal tip. This data will be made publicly available as the ﬁrst large dataset of its kind to promote future research and reproducibility. In Aim 2, a real-time bronchoscope localization model will be developed using advances in ma- chine learning, including deep neural networks, that have shown success in camera localization for non-medical applications. These models will regress the pose of the bronchoscope's distal tip using current and past video frames of the bronchoscope's built-in camera. The clinical utility of the system will be evaluated in simulation, 3D printed lung phantoms, and ex-vivo porcine lung experiments. The research, tightly coupled clinical experience, and associated training plan will provide a unique interdisciplinary skill-set in computer science, medical robotics, and procedural medicine. The outstanding research and clinical environment for this training at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ensures exceptional preparation for a career conducting cutting-edge research as a physician-scientist in medical robotics. Project Narrative Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United States, accounting for over 140,000 deaths per year (nearly one quarter of all cancer deaths). Bronchoscopy is currently the safest, least invasive, and least expensive diagnostic option, but yields conclusive results only 50-60% of the time, forcing many patients to consider more invasive procedures or leading to delayed diagnoses. We propose to develop computer algorithms that address localization limitations with existing bronchoscopes to improve diagnostic yield and achieve earlier lung cancer diagnosis in more patients.",Real-Time Bronchoscope Localization Using Machine Learning To Improve Lung Cancer Diagnosis,10315198,F30CA265234,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Bronchoscopes', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Skills', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electromagnetics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Family suidae', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health Benefit', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Localized Disease', 'Localized Lesion', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Needles', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nodule', 'North Carolina', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Puncture procedure', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'chest computed tomography', 'computer science', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'laboratory experiment', 'large datasets', 'lung cancer screening', 'men', 'millimeter', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'real time model', 'screening guidelines', 'simulation', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual human']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F30,2021,37546
