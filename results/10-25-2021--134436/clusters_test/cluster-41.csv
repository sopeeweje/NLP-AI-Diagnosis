"Genome analysis:  statistical methods and applications Project Summary In recent years new data and technologies have transformed our understanding of transcriptional processes and how they are influenced by genetic variation. The GTEx project has measured both genetic variation and transcriptional variation in 50 tissues across hundreds of individuals, and identified hundreds of thousands of genetic variants that are associated with gene expression (eQTLs). And technological innovations have now made it possible to interrogate transcription, genome-wide, in single cells. The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) project is currently using such technologies to profile millions of cells, with the ambitious goal of providing a comprehensive atlas of the diverse cell types that make up human bodies.  However, current analytic tools are limited in their ability to fully exploit the richness of these data. Current analysis tools for identifying eQTLs across 50 tissues perform well for identifying associations – both tissue- specific effects and those that are broadly shared across tissues – but are not yet designed for fine-mapping the underlying functional variants that explain these association signals. And methods for summarizing and characterizing transcriptional heterogeneity among single cells are not capable of capturing the complex layered character of this heterogeneity - for example, that cells might cluster into different groups depending on which genes or transcriptional processes are considered.  Here we propose to develop novel statistical methods to address these issues. We will develop dimension reduction techniques for single cell analysis, aimed at capturing the complex patterns of heterogeneity that existing methods ignore. We will develop statistical tools for reliably assessing the genes and processes that show transcriptional differences among groups of cells. And we will develop and apply methods to fine-map the functional variants underlying many of the eQTLs in the GTEx project data, fully exploiting the information in the many tissues profiled, and disseminate the results on the internet in a convenient form.  The overall goal of the project is to build and apply methods and software to help fully exploit the rich information in projects like GTEx and HCA, and make them available to the broad community of biological and medical scientists who can benefit from the results. Project Narrative Public health relevance: This project will generate and apply statistical tools for analysing large-scale studies that aim to understand the transcriptional variability of cell types, and the effects of genetic variation on transcriptomes, both of which are fundamental issues in biology. Understanding the way that cells change during disease state, and identifying genetic variants that impact transcription, have the potential to help understand the biology of disease, eventually leading to new treatment strategies.",Genome analysis:  statistical methods and applications,10226213,R01HG002585,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Factor Analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'International', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Pattern', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Process', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'design', 'differential expression', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'treatment strategy']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,500000
"The Clinical Genome Resource – Advancing genomic medicine through biocuration and expert assessment of genes and variants at scale Project Summary/Abstract High-quality evidence about clinically relevant genes and variants is a fundamental cornerstone of genomic medicine. All aspects of clinical care derive from accurate information about the etiology, natural history, and management of disease. With genomic analysis becoming more routine for patient care, the public availability of well-curated and expertly adjudicated knowledge about genes and variants is critical. The ClinGen Resource represents a highly collaborative effort of the genetics community to establish an evidence-based resource for the assessment of the clinical relevance of genes and variants that is readily accessible to (and trusted by) diagnostic laboratories, providers, and patients. Our objective is to improve patient care through enhanced and accelerated curation of the clinical genome using innovative approaches to overcome challenges and address new topics. We will accomplish this objective through the concerted pursuit of the following aims: aggregation of structured evidence regarding genetic conditions and the genes and variants that cause them; application of frameworks for expert curation of clinical validity, variant pathogenicity, and clinical actionability of genetic conditions; broad dissemination of tools, standards, knowledge bases, and assertions about clinically relevant genes and variants; and evaluation of all aspects of this work, so that we can improve the quality and impact of the resource for implementation of transparent, reproducible, and evidence-based genomic medicine. The proposal is innovative in several ways. It will aggregate data produced by cutting edge technologies, adapt annotation tools to enable crowdsourcing through community curation, and apply advanced natural language processing for annotation so that human curators can function at the top of their skill level. It will leverage the participation of a large and enthusiastic community of volunteers, thus acting as a force multiplier for the NIH funded teams. It will engage advocates who can conduct outreach within their areas of specialty, to further extend the reach of ClinGen products into genomic medicine research and clinical care. It will transform a wide range of clinical and basic science data into well-structured, transparently referenced expert assertions with documentation of provenance and attention to ensuring the interoperability of the resource with diverse end- users, including electronic health records. The proposed resource project is significant because in its entirety it will improve, scale, and disseminate the freely available expert curation and interpretation of the human genome to the global genomics community with the goal of improving health care for all people. Project Narrative The Clinical Genome Resource will make a fundamental contribution to public health care by providing a centralized, sustainable, and easily accessible source of expertly curated information about human genetic variation and its connection to human health. The resource relies on the collaboration of the global genomics community to improve understanding about the genetic basis of disease and to ensure the NHGRI’s mission that genomic advances benefit the health of all people.",The Clinical Genome Resource – Advancing genomic medicine through biocuration and expert assessment of genes and variants at scale,10270142,U24HG009650,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Education and Outreach', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Program Evaluation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'annotation  system', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'diverse data', 'evidence base', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome resource', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online resource', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'skills', 'tool', 'translational genomics', 'volunteer', 'workforce needs']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2021,4665990
"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,10113656,R01HG010040,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Length', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Medical Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'contig', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'light weight', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'open source', 'preservation', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,397125
"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by genetic variation.",Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype,10192782,K08HG010061,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reference Standards', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thrombosis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'rare cancer', 'rare variant', 'regression algorithm', 'statistics', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'variant of unknown significance', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,190941
"SOFTWARE FOR LARGE-SCALE INFERENCE OF THE GENETICS OF LIFESTYLE MEASURES, BIOMARKERS, AND COMMON AND RARE DISEASES Large-scale population biobanks around the world, the disease focused NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP), and the United States’ All of Us Precision Medicine Initiative project will generate massive genomic datasets combined with disease outcomes, and other health measurements. These genomic studies will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease. However, their association in the context of all possible associations identified will remain unclear if the data are separately analyzed. There is a growing recognition that most traits are polygenic. In addition, it is increasingly appreciated that pleiotropy is pervasive. Due to privacy concerns, it is challenging to share all possible genotype and phenotype data. Methods that can perform inference on summary level data, e.g. p-values, effect size estimates, and frequency, will facilitate our understanding of the genetics of human diseases and health. Here, we propose to develop software for large-scale inference of the genetics of lifestyle measures, biomarkers, and common and rare diseases. Achieving this goal requires expertise in medical and population genetics, statistical methods development, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. The project has three main objectives. First, we will create Global Biobank Engine: a powerful, interactive web platform for inference of the genetics of lifestyle measures, biomarkers, common and rare diseases. We will expand the features by implementing quality control visualizations and methods for flagging variants and phenotypes. We will add tools for study design that use empirical data to estimate statistical power, and create a flexible framework for statistical models that jointly analyze multiple phenotypes while controlling for false positive and negative findings. Secondly, we will improve Global Biobank Engine performance, scalability, and accessibility to facilitate future population biobanks and targeted common and rare disease. We will create a hosted, secure, and cost-effective cloud-based community resource, and design a database system that reduces the loading time for genetic association studies from hours to minutes and allows for streaming of statistical algorithms directly to genetic data. Lastly, we will improve genomic interpretation, visualization, and data sharing to dramatically increase the rate of translational discoveries by implementing novel analysis methods. We will support new variant annotation methods and integrate coding and non-coding information, including data from large-scale epigenomics studies, for variant and gene level inference. We will implement new Bayesian statistical models implemented in probabilistic programming languages, sparse canonical correlation analysis, and truncated singular value decomposition. PI Rivas and his team have ample experience with NIH-funded consortia, and they are dedicated to the overall mission of NIH and its funded investigators to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The goal of this project is to empower and democratize the discovery and inference process for genetics research of biomarkers, lifestyle measures, and common, rare diseases around the world by developing the Global Biobank Engine. Of particular importance is ensuring we have powerful tools and statistical methods for analyzing summary statistic data from population biobanks, and disease-focused genome sequencing programs. Achieving this goal requires expertise across many domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for disease mapping, and expertise in large-scale databases.","SOFTWARE FOR LARGE-SCALE INFERENCE OF THE GENETICS OF LIFESTYLE MEASURES, BIOMARKERS, AND COMMON AND RARE DISEASES",10251897,R01HG010140,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Markers', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Processes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human Genetics', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Life Style', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Negative Finding', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Privacy', 'Programming Languages', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Secure', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'algorithm development', 'biobank', 'cloud based', 'cost effective', 'data dissemination', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'programs', 'sharing platform', 'software development', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool', 'usability', 'web platform']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,392500
"Tools for Normalizing and Interpreting the Clinical Actionability of Genomic Variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The availability of high-throughput, low-cost sequencing has transformed the landscape of biomedical research by dramatically expanding our capacity to interrogate the sequence of the human genome. Consequently, there has been an explosion of biomedical literature describing the role of specific genomic variants and their impact on human diseases. These advances are bringing sequencing into the clinic to shape clinical practice from the patient’s genomic content, a paradigm colloquially referred to as genomic or precision medicine. There remain many obstacles to fully realizing our potential in the era of precision medicine. Among them is a recognized need for robust, well-engineered systems that provide knowledge about genomic variants and their role in disease. Ideally, such systems would provide a comprehensive summary of all knowledge that is relevant to the patient’s unique genomic content. An early bottleneck to realizing precision medicine was that, despite the substantial literature and several established knowledgebases that define interactions between drugs and genes, querying across them was extremely challenging. In response to this need, the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb, dgidb.org) was developed. Through a combination of automated processing and manual curation, drug-gene interaction information was collected, structured, and connected (normalized) from these diverse sources of data and entered into a database with a user-friendly search interface and an application programming interface (API). However, linking drug and drug-gene interaction concepts across resources remains an extremely challenging task, and aggregated drug-gene interactions are also challenging to represent in a way that highlights the utility of the collected knowledge for precision medicine efforts. This proposal seeks to improve our ability to normalize and interpret drug-gene interactions corresponding to patient genomic variants. We will achieve this goal through two specific aims. First, the DGIdb normalization routines will be improved through incorporation of new content and features. Among these, the DGIdb will support collections of drugs, including combination therapies and drug classes. Also, the DGIdb will have new community submission and curation features, allowing users to incorporate new knowledge into the database. Second, the Variant Interpretation Aggregator database (VIAdb) will be created to normalize knowledge across several disparate sources focused on the clinical interpretations of genomic variants. The VIAdb will operate as a stand-alone web tool and API and will behave as a source of relevant interpretations to DGIdb. Finally, we will develop techniques for automated identification of drug-gene interactions and variant interpretation consensus to assist community curation efforts. If successful, this research will improve breadth and consistency of variant interpretations and drug-gene interactions for precision medicine efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will improve our ability to interpret genomic variations in human patients in support of precision medicine efforts. Specifically, it will provide web-based tools for identifying potential therapies that specifically target the patient’s individual genes or variants, and an assessment of the clinical actionability of those drugs.",Tools for Normalizing and Interpreting the Clinical Actionability of Genomic Variants,10415312,R00HG010157,"['Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'The Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center at the Vanderbilt University', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cancer type', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug resource', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source tool', 'precision medicine', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'response', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly', 'web app', 'web interface', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R00,2021,249000
"Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks Abstract Accurately detecting structural variation in the genome is a challenging task. Many approaches have been developed over the last few decades, yet it is estimated that tens of thousands of variants are still being missed in a given sample. Many of these variants are missed due to the limitations of using short-read sequencing to identify large variants. Although many of these missed variants are located within complex regions of the genome, it has been shown that some still have clinical relevance making their discovery important. New platforms have been developed for sequencing the genome using long-reads and show promise for overcoming many of these limitations creating the ability to identify the full spectrum of simple and complex structural variants. Because this technology is relatively young, new computational approaches to support the analysis of long-read sequencing data can aid in the discovery of these variants which are still being missed. In addition to detecting novel variation in samples with long-read sequencing data, computational approaches can be developed to leverage these novel variant calls to reanalyze the hundreds of thousands of short-read datasets currently available. In this proposal, we plan to develop new computational approaches to identify novel structural variation in the genome. In Aim 1, we will apply a recurrence approach to analyze long read sequencing datasets utilizing deep neural networks. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool to derive profiles of structural variants predicted in long- reads which can be used to identify and genotype structural variants calls in short read data-sets. Together, these approaches will allow researchers to accurately characterize structural variation in both long and short- read datasets. Narrative Structural variation has been implicated in numerous human diseases but there are still tens of thousands of variants being overlooked in the genome. The proposed research aims to detect novel variation by developing new computational tools to analyze data generated by state-of-the-art sequencing methods. These tools will aid in the discovery of variants associated with human health.",Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks,10128484,F31HG010569,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Sciences', 'Categories', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Label', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'detection method', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'variant detection']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2021,38173
"Comprehensive Characterization of Adaptive Regulatory Variation Linked to Human Disease Project Summary/ Abstract  Over the past decade there has been a rapid expansion of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as the development of large-scale consortia like the UKBioBank and the All of Us project. While the number of genetic associations to human traits and disease is soaring, tools to characterize and interpret these variants are lacking. One challenge to realizing the potential of genomics is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, regulatory sequences. However, ‘regulatory grammar’ – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with transcription factors to control gene expression, is poorly understood. A repertoire of well-characterized causal variants is needed to build generalizable models with which to unlock insights into the genetic basis of human health and history.  Natural selection is a powerful driver of human genetic variation. As our species has encountered new climates, dramatic alterations in diet, and novel pathogens, these selective pressures have left hundreds of signatures of adaptation in our genomes, reflected in our species’ diversity of disease risk and morphology. For selection to have acted positively on them, these adaptive alleles must exhibit relatively strong phenotypic effects, and they continue to contribute to modern traits and disease (e.g. height or sickle cell anemia). Salient examples of human adaptation include immunity, metabolism, and morphology, all of which have extensive, unresolved GWAS signals. This renders the lens of recent evolution a powerful, but underutilized, tool for identifying alleles that contribute to phenotypic variation in modern association studies.  This proposal aims to expand the repertoire of well-characterized GWAS signals, by A) using evolution to prioritize adaptive variants, and B) applying novel, high-throughput experimental and computational tools to comprehensively decipher the functions of regulatory variants. These approaches will identify much needed causal variants, devise paradigms for their study, and inform future predictive models to characterize them. During the mentored phase of the K99, I will first develop methods to colocalize signals of selection and GWAS, and then use Variant Effect Predictions (VEP) to predict their function. I will then employ high-through methods such as a the massively parallel reporter assay and CRISPR non-coding screen to functionally characterize them directly. From the adaptive GWAS alleles our screens identify, we will make in-vivo system to more deeply characterize them during the Independent R00 phase. During this time I will deploy a variety of genomic tools such as ChIP, ChIA-PET, and RNA-seq to understand the adaptive variants’ molecular etiology. I will use the empirical data fro these studies, and the MPRA/HCR-FlowFISH screens to build more accurate VEP models. ! Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to identify adaptive human alleles underlying genome wide association studies and comprehensively characterize them using novel computational and experimental tools. I will then make in-vivo models of these to test their function and effects on fitness, improving future predictions of how genetic variants impact human evolution and health.",Comprehensive Characterization of Adaptive Regulatory Variation Linked to Human Disease,10469855,R00HG010669,"['African', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'CCRL2 gene', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Climate', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Height', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Immunity', 'Lassa Fever', 'Left', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Selections', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'emerging pathogen', 'fitness', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic tools', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'lens', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2021,248936
"Scalable detection and interpretation of structural variation in human genomes PROJECT SUMMARY Structural variation (SV), is a diverse class of genome variation that includes copy number variants (CNVs) such as deletions and duplications, as well as balanced rearrangements, such as inversions and reciprocal translocations. A typical human genome harbors >4,000 SVs larger than 300bp and their large size increases the potential to delete or duplicate genes, disrupt chromatin structure, and alter expression. Despite their prevalence and potential for phenotypic consequence, SVs remain notoriously difficult to detect and genotype with high accuracy. Much of this difficulty is driven by the fact DNA sequence alignment “signals” indicating SVs are far more complex than for single-nucleotide and insertion deletion variants. Unlike SNP alignments that vary only in allele state, alignments supporting SVs vary in state (supports an alternate structure or not) alignment location, and type. Consequently, the accuracy of SV discovery is much lower than that of SNPs and INDELs. Furthermore, SV pipelines scale poorly and are difficult to run. These challenges are a barrier for single genome analysis and studies of families must invest substantial effort into eliminating a sea of false positives. These problems become exponentially more acute for large-scale sequencing efforts such as TOPmed, the Centers for Common Disease Genetics, and the All of Us program. Software efficiency is key to scalability for such projects. However, of equal importance is comprehensive, accurate discovery.  Building upon more than a decade of software development experience and analyzing SV in diverse disease contexts, we have invested significant effort into understanding the causes of the insufficient accuracy for SV discovery. These efforts, together with our research and development experience in this area, give us unique insight into improving the accuracy and scalability of SV discovery. Our goal is to narrow the accuracy gap between SNP/INDEL variation and structural variation discovery. These developments will empower studies of human genomes in diverse contexts and will therefore have broad impact. Our goals are to: 1. Develop a deep learning model to correct systematic variation in sequence depth. This new machine  learning model will correct systematic biases in DNA sequence depth and dramatically improve the  discovery of deletions and duplications. 2. Improve the speed, scalability, and accuracy of SV detection and genotyping. Using new algorithms,  we will bring the accuracy of SV detection much closer to that of SNP and INDEL discovery and allow  accurate SV discovery to be deployed at scale. 3. Create a map of genomic constraint for SV from population-scale genome analysis. We will deploy  our new methods to detect and genotype structural variation among tens of thousands of human genomes.  The resulting SV map will empower the creation of a model of genomic constraint for SV and enable new  software to predict deleterious SVs, especially in the noncoding genome. PROJECT NARRATIVE Single-nucleotide DNA changes paint an incomplete picture of a human’s genome. A more complete picture must include a genome's structural variation (SV), an important class of genome variation that includes copy number variants (CNVs) such as deletions and duplications. However, existing methods have poor accuracy. As the genetics community transitions to large-scale genome sequencing studies, there is an acute need for improved SV discovery methods. This proposal introduces a series of algorithmic and software innovations that will empower SV discovery, genotyping, and interpretation in large-scale human disease studies.",Scalable detection and interpretation of structural variation in human genomes,10153847,R01HG010757,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Clip', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Error Sources', 'Exhibits', 'Family Study', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Fusion', 'Gene Structure', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Paint', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reciprocal Translocation', 'Research', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Systematic Bias', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'dosage', 'exome', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'method development', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'prevent', 'research and development', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'variant detection', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,692048
"The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms Project Summary  Recent years have witnessed the development of large research projects that involve  genotyping hundreds of thousands of individuals, on which we have available detailed medical records. Examples include the All of us research project, the Million Veteran Program, and the UKBiobank resource. Often, whole-genome sequencing data is also available for a substantial fraction of the individuals. These large samples, with their precise genotypic and phenotypic information, give us the opportunity to bring our understanding of the relations between genetic variation and traits of medical interest to the next level.  While the initial small sample sizes available for genome wide association studies (GWAS) motivated analyses that were approximative in nature, we are now in the position to probe more closely the genetic causal mechanisms underlying medically relevant phenotypes. We can aspire to distinguish variants that have causal effects from those that are associated because of linkage disequilibrium or population structure. Indeed, we need to pay even greater attention to the implications of hidden confounders: even small effects become significant when sample sizes are large enough.  Increasing the resolution with which we can describe causal mechanisms will result in the identification of clearer targets for drug development. It will also improve the precision of  personalized risk evaluations based on genotypes: if we can construct risk scores using variants that are truly causal, their performance will remain solid across ethnicities and environmental exposures.  To zoom in on genetic variants with causal effects, this project will leverage a set of new statistical methodologies that the investigators have recently introduced. These new approaches are remarkably flexible, in that they do not rely on specific assumptions of how phenotypes are linked to genetic variants. Indeed, they allow researchers to capitalize on powerful machine learning algorithms and, crucially, equip their results with precise replicability guarantees.  We have assembled a diverse and complementary team, including experts in statistical  genomics, methodological statistics and computer science, with a strong record both of software development and genetic data analysis. A postdoctoral scholar and two graduate students will contribute to the research program, and the interdisciplinary training they will acquire in  statistics, computation and genetics will add another substantial benefit. Personalized medicine strives to provide treatments that are fine-tuned to the patients, aware both of the specificity of their diseases as well as of the individuals’ background characteristics. In order to achieve this promise, identifying those genes and mutations that influence the medically relevant traits is an important tool: it gives us the opportunity to understand the biological pathways involved, inspires drug development, informs treatment and counseling and facilitates prevention. The proposed research would develop new methods of statistical analysis to harness the information contained in large datasets, increasing our ability to distinguish the genetic mutations that directly impact phenotypes, from those that are merely correlated with traits of interest.",The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms,10291186,R56HG010812,"['Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computer science', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'polygenic risk score', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'sex', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,455280
"Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits Project Summary  Over the past decade, data generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to analyze heritability of human diseases and complex traits to improve understanding of genetic architecture, including identifying the genetic variants associated with diseases and their effect sizes. These heritability enrichment analyses have revealed underlying biological mechanisms such as regulatory elements involved in disease pathways. This research proposes statistical methods and analysis to formally assess the contribution of biological pathways, gene networks, and re-prioritized functional annotations to the genetic architecture of 94 human diseases and complex traits. Better understanding of disease architecture will improve genome-wide associations and fine mapping and provides robust inference of disease etiology and mechanisms.  The first aim is to determine the contribution of disease-associated gene pathways to disease heritability. It is well known that an abnormality in individual genes rarely causes a human disease. Large-scale pathway analysis will elucidate disease pathways by constructing functional annotations and applying an existing polygenic method to partition heritability. Furthermore, pathway analyses on candidate genes identified via whole-exome sequencing (WES) data will inform new biological inference. The resulting set of enriched pathway-trait pairs will further help with independent validation of previously reported associations and for novel associations enriched for trait heritability.  The second aim is to determine the contribution of gene network to disease heritability across 94 diseases, focusing on hub genes defined by a broad set of network connectivity metrics. The contribution of gene network to disease heritability has been only partially answered, limited to few network connectivity metrics across 42 diseases. Comprehensive analysis of gene sets informed by published gene networks will inform a new direction of integrating gene networks to infer biological mechanisms of human diseases. In addition, visualization method for large-scale gene networks will greatly enhance research translation, serving as a useful resource for studying gene-gene interactions for potential drugs and therapeutic targets.  The third aim is to de-noise and re-prioritize Mendelian annotations to infer candidate genes. Despite considerable process on prioritizing rare variants impacting Mendelian diseases, little is known about the utility of these Mendelian pathogenicity scores for common disease. I will conduct heritability enrichment analyses to answer informativeness of Mendelian disease pathogenicity scores for common disease. To further improve their informativeness, I propose a machine learning variant reprioritization framework. Ultimately, this project will produce (1) a detailed understanding of disease-associated biological pathways to disease heritability, (2) a set of functional annotations informed by gene networks significantly enriched for disease heritability, and (3) a new method to prioritize variants and identifying candidate genes based on diverse genomic features. Project Narrative Understanding human genetic variations, from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to mutations, offers a great potential in uncovering underlying disease mechanisms by identifying new disease-associated genes and in discovering potential drug targets and therapeutics. This proposed studies aim to understand the role of these genetic variations in trait heritability, leveraging disease-associated biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations. The developed method to prioritize variants and genes will answer the contribution of gene pathways, gene sets informed by gene networks, and Mendelian pathogenicity scores to disease heritability.","Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits",10126720,F31HG010818,"['Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'denoising', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'fitness', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'open source', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2021,46036
"The fitness effects of de novo structural variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) focuses on the training of Dr. PingHsun Hsieh to become an independent investigator of large-scale genomics and human population genetics. Dr. Hsieh is a population geneticist by training, and the proposed studies will advance his training into long-read- based sequencing technologies and novel machine-learning approaches to study the fitness consequences of new mutations, with a focus on structural variants (SVs), in humans and nonhuman primates. Another essential piece will be the development of resources on which types of new SVs are most likely to be pathogenic and hence most worth further effort by medical researchers. The methods developed in this work will enable other researchers to do more hypothesis-free analysis of SVs in disease etiology. Specifically, the training program will center on the study of the distribution of fitness effects of new SVs in human and nonhuman primates using high-quality SV calls and genotypes from several large-scale long- and short-read sequencing projects. The mentored work will take place under the supervision of the primary mentor, Dr. Evan Eichler, and the co-mentor, Dr. Sharon Browning, both at the University of Washington (UW). The mentor and co-mentor are well-established experts in the characterization of genomic variations using high-throughput technologies and the development of stochastic modeling methods for large-scale genetic data, respectively. Dr. Hsieh will also gain advice from a formal advisory committee as well as through activities arranged by the Department of Genome Sciences (GS), which is an optimal place for the mentored training providing the candidate with access to outstanding scientists in areas including genetics of model organisms, disease, population genetics, and the development of high-throughput genomic technologies. While found in nature and yet generally deemed to be deleterious given their size, SVs can be beneficial, and thus, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new SVs (i.e., the relative frequencies of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious SVs) remains elusive. In the proposed studies, we will infer the DFE of new SVs and other variants to assess their relative importance in nature, which in turn helps prioritize variants (e.g., SVs vs. single- nucleotide variants [SNVs]) in medical genetics. Specifically, in the K99/R00 phases we will (1) infer the DFE of new SVs and SNVs using a diverse panel of ~100 long-read and ~4,000 short-read high-coverage human and nonhuman primate genomes; (2) compare the DFE of new mutations among primates using contemporary and ancient DNA genomes; and (3) study the fitness effects and selective constraints on diseases in different mutation categories in large cohorts of >20,000 genomes. The skills learned in this proposal are on the cutting-edge and are tailored for the candidate to amass a great amount of knowledge in new areas of genomics, which will be applicable to many organisms and diseases and critical to the candidate’s future independent laboratory. NARRATIVE Understanding the relative abundance of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious mutations in different variant categories (e.g., genic vs. intergenic) provides useful guidance and resources for biomedical researchers to prioritize disease-causing mutations and strategize their efforts. To date, however, little effort has been made to study the full spectrum of fitness effects of new structural variants – an important but largely underappreciated genomic variation. The work proposed here seeks to leverage long-read sequencing technologies and develop novel machine-learning approaches to quantify the fitness effects of new mutation, with a focus on structural variants, and subsequently delineate the relative importance among different types of mutations in genetic diseases.",The fitness effects of de novo structural variants,10153859,K99HG011041,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Award', 'Base Pairing', 'Benchmarking', 'Categories', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomedical resource', 'career', 'cohort', 'disease-causing mutation', 'expectation', 'fitness', 'genome sciences', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput technology', 'human population genetics', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pressure', 'simulation', 'skills', 'technology development', 'trait']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2021,132244
"Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most disease-associated variants lie in non-coding regions of the genome and exert their influence through effects on gene expression. However, we lack a predictive framework to interpret such non-coding variants, limiting how genomic data is used in precision medicine. We may be able to interpret non-coding variants with new machine learning algorithms, but so far the practical applications of machine learning in functional genomics have been limited because of two major challenges. First, the size and diversity of training data sets in functional genomics are orders of magnitude smaller than in applications where machine learning has been successful, such as image recognition and product recommendation. A second challenge is that if training data are not collected in an appropriate in vitro cellular model, then the resulting machine learning models may not generalize to relevant in vivo cell types. To improve the application of machine learning to non-coding variants, I propose to address both the limited size of training data sets and the efficacy of cell culture models. A core principle of machine learning is that model performance improves with more data. In Aim 1, I propose to increase the size and diversity of training data by performing iterative cycles of machine learning and experimental validation with Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs). The key aspect of my approach is to algorithmically design each successive MPRA library to contain sequences that are most likely to improve the next round of modeling. I recently trained my first model on data that I collected from MPRA experiments of cis-regulatory sequences that function in mammalian photoreceptors. To avoid any issues with cell lines, I performed these experiments in ex vivo developing retinas, which retain the appropriate tissue architecture. However, unlike photoreceptors, most cell types are not experimentally tractable in their native physiological context. Thus, it will be important to determine how well in vitro cell lines recapitulate in vivo cis-regulation. In Aim 2, I propose to determine whether a tractable cell culture model can recapitulate results from ex vivo retinas. I will use existing MPRA data from ex vivo retinas as a standard to compare against data collected in cell lines engineered to express combinations of photoreceptor transcription factors. I aim to address whether engineering tractable cell lines to express tissue-specific transcription factors might be a general approach for collecting data to train machine learning models that generalize to in vivo systems. Successful completion of these aims will produce a general approach to increase the size and diversity of functional genomic training data, and may result in a general method for producing experimentally tractable systems for machine learning applications, ultimately helping us better apply genomic data to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many genetic variants that cause disease do not affect the structure of genes, but instead affect short DNA sequences that control when, where, or how much a gene is produced. Every individual human contains thousands of genetic variants in these control regions, but only a small number of these variants influence gene production. I propose a combined experimental and computational framework to predict which variants affect gene production and which variants are harmless.",Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning,10177882,F31HG011431,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Architecture', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Performance', 'Photoreceptors', 'Physiological', 'Production', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Retina', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'cellular engineering', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'practical application', 'precision medicine', 'synthetic biology', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,31970
"Single cell atlas as a roadmap for interpreting human genetic variation in complex disease Project Summary Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci likely affecting human health. To translate these findings into therapeutic targets and disease treatments, we need to understand the cellular context and underlying biological mechanisms through which each disease associated variant disrupts function. Large scale, information rich datasets are being generated across multiple modalities including transcriptomics from single cell RNA-seq studies, traits and phenotypes from the UK Biobank and germline genetic variation from exome sequencing studies. Here, we propose to develop methods to integrate these amazing resources towards understanding the identifying biological and cellular mechanisms that are leading to disease. The objectives will be accomplished with the following specific aims: 1) Integrate population scale biological datasets including UK Biobank and single cell transcriptomics data to construct gene modules with the goal to recapitulate biological pathways. 2) Develop a statistical framework to measure mutational burden across each of the cell type specific gene modules. Together, this research proposal will increase the power in interpreting human genetic variation and help better understand the mechanism through which they act. These methods are being developed around an IBD dataset and will derive substantial molecular information about the mechanisms driving IBD. The lessons and methodological advances from this work will be directly applicable in many complex disease contexts. Project Narrative Genome wide association studies are highly successful identifying thousands of disease-associated loci but fall short at 1) pinpointing the biological mechanisms through which the variants effect disease and 2) capturing the effects of rare variants which may be having larger effect on disease outcomes. This research proposal details plans to integrate high-throughput single cell transcriptomics, population scale biobank datasets and exome sequencing from large disease cohorts to learn a prior on which genes are likely working together in which cell types and consequently improve the statistical power in interpreting rare human genetic variation.

"Automated, high-throughput identification of genetic structural variants for gene editing and undiagnosed genetic diseases screening ABSTRACT A simple method to comprehensively discover, characterize and identify structural variants arising from normal metabolic processes, as well as cell manipulations, would have great utility for gene editing, oncology, and rare disease research, among other applications. De Novo Directional Genomic Hybridization (dGH™) has been developed to efficiently screen thousands of cells for the presence of simple, complex, and heterogenous structural variants. In this project, Automated, High-Throughput Identification of Genetic Structural Variants for Gene Editing and Undiagnosed Genetic Diseases Screening, we propose K-Band™ dGH, an expanded dGH method. K-Band dGH is an in-situ hybridization method that utilizes high-density chromatid paints with bands of distinct spectra. A normal chromosome has a definitive pattern of bands, spectra and probe density. Structural variants are detected and identified via changes to the signal pattern. The proposed K-Band™ dGH method will provide the means for de novo discovery of balanced allelic translocations involving breakpoints at the same loci, inversions, and sister chromatid recombination and exchange events that are invisible to existing methods such as sequencing and aCGH. K-Band dGH will additionally characterize deletions, duplications, translocations, aneuploidy, polyploidy and more complex rearrangements. Structural variations cause a wide range of disorders, from rare diseases to cancers, and can be precise and definitive biomarkers. Also, because variations arise from the mis-repair of DNA double-strand breaks, unintended structural damage is an inevitable and potentially high-risk byproduct of genome editing. The potential of genome editing approaches such as CRISPR-Cas9 in the treatment of diseases is widely recognized and the realization of the promise of such therapeutic approaches will rely on accurate confirmation of the presence and absence of potentially risky structural variants. For these reasons, comprehensive detection and characterization of structural variations is a necessary step toward understanding, diagnosing and ultimately precisely treating genetic diseases. From a homogeneous or heterogenous population of cells, and in a single experiment, K-Band dGH will identify cells with a structurally normal phenotype, detect all classes of structural variants, and locate the breakpoints of all simple and complex structural variants in each cell. With a limit of detection below 5Kb, K-Band dGH is an ideal method for determining the outcomes of gene editing, discovering the causes of undiagnosed rare diseases, profiling genomic structural instability and variability, and discovering and validating previously unknown structural genetic drivers of disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern genomics, driven by the demands of personalized medicine, needs higher throughput, higher integrity, and improved resolution to enable the discovery of new disease drivers and in the development of safer gene therapies. Rapid, accurate, efficient characterization of structural variants and their associated risks is critical to the discovery of potential therapeutic avenues for undiagnosed and rare diseases, and to the development of engineered cellular therapies, including stem cells, CAR-T and other gene therapies leveraging gene-editing tools such as CRISPR. K-Band™ dGH, proposed in Automated, High-Throughput Identification of Genetic Structural Variants for Gene Editing and Undiagnosed Genetic Diseases Screening, will enable single-cell, single-experiment identification of clinically important structural variants that cannot be discovered or identified by NGS or other available methods with broad applicability in genome engineering R&D, target discovery and personalized therapy development.","Automated, high-throughput identification of genetic structural variants for gene editing and undiagnosed genetic diseases screening",10228763,R44HG011442,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR therapeutics', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cells', 'Chromatids', 'Chromosomal Rearrangement', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Color', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Double Strand Break Repair', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Hybridizations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Polyploidy', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Radiation', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reciprocal Translocation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sister Chromatid', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'comparative genomic hybridization', 'density', 'detection limit', 'experimental study', 'fluorophore', 'gene therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genotoxicity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'new therapeutic target', 'personalized medicine', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'screening', 'stem cells', 'structural genomics', 'technological innovation', 'therapeutic gene', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,"KROMATID, INC.",R44,2021,584436
"Deep-learning based profiling of patient-derived cells as a tool for genomic and translational medicine Project Summary/Abstract: The genetic landscape of rare and common diseases has emerged as heterogeneous and complex. Already, researchers and clinicians face the challenge to discern pathophysiological mechanism and treatment opportunities for hundreds of genetic subtypes that have been identified in rare diseases, such as inherited neuropathies (INs) or mitochondrial diseases (MiDs) alone. Still, a large fraction of disease loci remains to be discovered – a daunting task, since gene-identification studies often require immense sample-sizes, which are difficult to achieve, even for more common conditions. Simultaneously, much of the heritability of many disorders appears to be determined by the collective impact of possibly thousands of low-impact variants, spread across the genome. Ideally, the impact of a given set of candidate variants could be assessed within high-throughput framework that accounts for the genetic context of individual patients. Leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms, we have developed an unbiased, scalable method to rapidly identify disease- associated phenotypes in high-resolution, multiplexed, fluorescent microscopy images of primary, patient derived cells. In turn, the discovered phenotypes can be exploited as experimental signals against which the disease relevance of candidate variants can be confirmed, by virtue of genetic complementation experiments. At the same time, the standardized and scalable nature of our method renders it suitable to test potential therapeutic interventions, e.g. to test the efficacy of potential gene-therapy, or to screen small molecule libraries, while maintaining patient-specific granularity. The goal of this proposal is to apply our approach to an expanded cohort of patient cells and to refine methods to interpret both genetic and pharmacological perturbations. In this, I will be supported by an exceptional and multidisciplinary team of experts in clinical, molecular and functional genetics, and computer scientists, within the world-class scientific environment offered by Columbia University and the Broad Institute. In a carefully designed development plan, I will finalize my training in machine learning and data science, expand my expertise to single-cell RNA-sequencing and other single-cell methods, and acquire essential leadership and scholarly skills required for an independent research career. Over the course of this award, I will apply our cellular profiling approach to generate a standardized map of deep, quantitative descriptions of disease-associated cellular phenotypes across a number of INs, MiDs and neurodegenerative conditions. We will explore the integration of RNA-sequencing to enhance our approach. Finally, we will apply our method to the discovery and confirmation of new disease genes, and screen a limited number of pharmacological interventions through our method. Together, the proposed developmental plan and research strategy will foster my ability to lead an independent research program, to establish cellular profiling as a powerful platform to advance genomic and translational medicine. Project Narrative: The functional interpretation of genetic variation in diseases faces critical roadblocks, due to the lack of scalable methods to assess the significance of candidate variants experimentally, while accounting for genomic context. This proposal introduces a morphological profiling method, that is able to rapidly identify disease-associated phenotypes in patient cells and offers a cost-efficient and unbiased way to determine the significance of putative pathogenic variants at scale.

"New quantitative approaches to interpret variant pathogenicity Project Summary Insufficient knowledge and throughput to interpret pathogenicity of genetic variants identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) is a major bottleneck for genomic medicine implementation. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines identify high-confidence pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants but are limited in scalability. Many variants are classified as variants of uncertain significance by the ACMG/AMP guidelines without an indication of which of these variants are more or less likely to be pathogenic, leading to inappropriate medical treatment. Hence, I propose to develop standardized quantitative approaches to improve our ability to interpret genomic variations accurately at high-throughput. In-silico tools are commonly used to assign variant pathogenicity based on conservation, but their predictive accuracy is limited. The current methods have not been calibrated across genes, and the same pathogenicity score does not infer the same likelihood of pathogenicity across different genes. In this proposal, 1) I aim to recalibrate the pathogenicity scores incorporating gene-specific features making the pathogenicity scores more comparable across genes, and improve the accuracy of pathogenicity predictions using advanced deep neural network models and functional data from saturation mutagenesis studies. 2) I aim to quantify the ACMG/AMP variant classification and provide probability of variant pathogenicity for clinically relevant genes using advanced supervised learning and leveraging a large case- control cohort. The improved computational predictions (Aim 1) will refine variant prioritization for downstream analyses and strengthen the computational evidence used in the ACMG/AMP guidelines. The estimated probability of variant pathogenicity based on ACMG/AMP guideline (Aim 2) will improve communication between laboratories, health care providers and patients about genetic test results. Project Narrative Accurate diagnosis of rare genetic disorders facilitates prognosis, guides clinical treatment, clarifies risk prediction of other family members and informs reproductive decisions.

"Toward DNA Sequencing as a Primary Newborn Screen for Treatable Disorders not Amenable to Current Screening We propose to evaluate whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) as an approach for population screening of early-onset treatable recessively inherited conditions. Our analysis will be based on prior and additional work on the large, ancestrally diverse cohort of children constituting all 1,334 cases of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) diagnosed by tandem mass spectrometry screening in California over an 8.5 year period.  Our prior analysis found that WES lacked adequate sensitivity and specificity to replace current newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A screening-optimized DNA variant interpretation pipeline identified two known or likely pathogenic variants in most, but not all, affected cases. The pipeline was 88% sensitive and 98.4% specific, numbers too low to replace MS/MS. We found that 1/3 of known or likely pathogenic variants were novel, of which roughly 2/3 were missense. Adequate sensitivity and specificity therefore require accurate annotation of missense variants.  DNA variant annotation has focused on individual variants and is most applicable for dominant disorders for which pathogenicity is determined by a single variant. For recessive diseases, expression is determined by two variants on different chromosomes. We propose a new framework for disease prediction in recessive conditions, in which the bi-allelic variants, or diplotype, is used to assess pathogenicity. We will improve disease detection for autosomal recessive diseases through screening utilizing DNA sequencing by 1) improving interpretation of bi-allelic missense variants by using variant co-evolution, conservation, amino acid proximity and other features to derive a risk score, 2) considering both variants in recessive pathogenicity prediction, and 3) using the California newborn screening data set as a training set with a small number of positives for each disorder and a large number of controls (those cases positive for a different disease) to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict likelihood of disease. To address sensitivity, for 103 exome negative IEM cases from our data set we will fully interrogate the exome data, both for known IEM genes and also the entire exome to identify novel genes. Finally, for those remaining unsolved, we will perform WGS to identify additional causal variants. In so doing, we will also compare WES and WGS in terms of overall sensitivity and specificity for screening.  We anticipate that the proposed study will be a significant advance in assessing DNA sequencing as a newborn screening tool for those early-onset treatable diseases for which there is currently no screening test, leading to decreased death and disability. We propose to improve DNA sequencing as a newborn screening test by increasing the sensitivity and specificity to an acceptable level for those early-onset treatable disorders for which there is no alternative screening test. Given the large number of early-onset treatable conditions for which there is no test, or for which current testing continues to miss cases, DNA sequencing has the potential to have a large public health impact. Current newborn screening for multiple inborn errors of metabolism by tandem mass spectrometry is able to detect 40-50 disorders and is considered to be among the ten greatest public health successes of the first decade of the 21st century by the Centers for Disease Control; DNA based newborn screening could greatly increase the number of disorders identified and lead to timely and disease-specific interventions, thereby further decreasing death and disability due to treatable, early-onset recessive disorders.",Toward DNA Sequencing as a Primary Newborn Screen for Treatable Disorders not Amenable to Current Screening,10228509,R21HG011805,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Benign', 'California', 'Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Ammonia)', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Homocystinuria', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Modeling', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Public Health', 'Recessive Genes', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urea cycle disorders', 'Variant', 'Vitamin B6', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cohort', 'disability', 'early onset', 'early screening', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'success', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2021,323000
"Comprehensive characterization of variants underlying heart and blood diseases with CRISPR base editing Project Summary How genomic variation influences cellular function is a fundamental problem with tremendous importance for human disease. While it has traditionally been difficult to study the effects of specific sequence variants in an experimentally controlled manner, precise genome editing technologies such as CRISPR base editing enable “writing” of trait-associated variants to cells to unravel their function. In this proposal, we will perform multi-modal genome editing-based functional characterization of a total of 72,000 genomic variants associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and hematological traits. CVD and blood traits are uniquely suited to functional dissection because cardiovascular (coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia) and blood traits have among the best-powered multi-ethnic GWAS of any traits, and a substantial component of trait variability can be captured in cellular assays that can be scaled to perform high-throughput screening. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team of world-class experts to provide a generalizable pipeline to unravel the functional impact of CVD and blood trait variants by integrating: (1) rich and ancestry-diverse human genetic discoveries, (2) broadly targetable CRISPR base editors and efficient delivery to primary human cells, (3) high-content assays to profile phenotypes at the levels of chromatin, gene expression and cellular function, and (4) computational methods to design, interpret, visualize, and share experimental results. In Aim 1, we will employ a robust, three-tiered variant prioritization scheme that incorporates evidence for disease association from large, multi-ethnic GWAS as well as probability of causality to nominate variants for functional assessment. Through this scheme, we will select variants associated with red blood cell and neutrophil traits, coronary artery disease, blood pressure, and HDL and LDL cholesterol that span a range of allelic frequencies and likely causality to test in high-throughput cellular assays. In Aim 2, we will perform systematic cellular phenotype-based screens using base editors to install candidate variants as well as CRISPR epigenetic inhibition and activation to explore variant-containing regulatory elements. We will use eight established, scalable cellular phenotypic readouts, each of which will enable us to assess which of 12,000 variants and variant-centered elements alter CVD and blood trait-associated cellular phenotypes. We will additionally employ a high-throughput, genome-integrated chromatin accessibility assay to assess which variants alter chromatin accessibility in trait-relevant cell lines. We will follow up with targeted single cell RNA-seq of 5,600 variants in primary cells from donors of different sex and ethnicity. In Aim 3, we will produce a catalog of validated variants and their association with phenotypes for each of the proposed screens. We will collaborate with other IGVF groups to utilize these data to optimize models that predict functional variants, regulatory elements and disease-causing biological mechanisms, ultimately leading to more complete understanding of the genetic underpinnings of cardiovascular and blood disease risk. Project Narrative Genetic variation dictates an individual’s risk of developing common ailments such as heart and blood diseases. Traditionally, it has been difficult to determine which of the millions of sequence variants influence disease susceptibility due to a lack of technologies that enable the causal assignment of genetic variants at scale. To address this unmet need, we will develop a generalizable pipeline that leverages technological breakthroughs in precise genome editing to unravel the functional impact of genetic variation on heart and blood disease risk, offering a rich catalog of the consequences of thousands of disease-associated variants that will be of broad utility to the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium and wider biomedical community.",Comprehensive characterization of variants underlying heart and blood diseases with CRISPR base editing,10296877,UM1HG012010,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Pressure', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dissection', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Erythrocytes', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Hemoglobin', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Leukocytes', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scheme', 'Serum', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'blood lipid', 'causal variant', 'computational pipelines', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'multi-ethnic', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'open source', 'precise genome editing', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'screening', 'sex', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'trait', 'working group']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,UM1,2021,1033149
"Supporting IGVF by modeling genetics, function, and phenotype with machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY Leveraging the power of the human genome to understand the risks, causes, and treatments of human dis- ease remains a grand challenge for all of biology and medicine. While sequencing costs have plummeted, and clinical implementation has become commonplace, interpreting human genomes remains a highly challenging task. It is our hypothesis that understanding the function of the genome and its products at a molecular, tissue, and phenotypic level using advanced machine learning will help unlock the door to better interpretation for sci- entific discovery and better clinical outcomes based on genomic medicine. To that end, our team has spent the past two decades working to develop computational models of biology, to predict how those models are perturbed through changes in the genome, and to use those perturbations to model phenotype and disease. We have had many research outputs in this area, having developed and published a number of widely used methods that predict biochemical and phenotypic changes caused by genetic variants to infer phenotype and pathogenicity. However, we believe that there is a coming convergence between the variability in clinical inter- pretation, high-throughput biotechnology assays, and modern machine learning methodology that will result in more accurate clinical assessments and improved clinical care. Therefore, in this ambitious proposal, we are addressing important questions in variant and genome interpretation consistent with this view and the mission of the IGVF Consortium. Our major goals include (1) developing advanced semi-supervised approaches to predict variants that disrupt molecular function and/or are capable of altering phenotypes; (2) identifying in- formative assays, variants, and genes to automate experimental design with an emphasis on resource alloca- tion and reduction of ascertainment bias in the Consortium; and (3) developing machine learning approaches to integrate these models into a workflow of the IGVF Consortium and enable the interaction between compu- tation and experiment in order to catalyze advances in both genetic variant interpretation and predictive model development. PROJECT NARRATIVE We are developing advanced machine learning approaches and tools for understanding the link between mo- lecular function and phenotype and to guide experimental data collection within the IGVF Consortium. These tools will assist in determining whether and how the observed differences on a human genome give rise to a risk of a disease or other condition of clinical interest. Our methods are distributable on the internet and will be made widely available.","Supporting IGVF by modeling genetics, function, and phenotype with machine learning",10297060,U01HG012022,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'California', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publishing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'active method', 'assay development', 'base', 'biological systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'cost', 'design', 'diverse data', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'model development', 'molecular modeling', 'mutation screening', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'protein structure', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,356264
"Linking Variants to Multi-scale Phenotypes via a Synthesis of Subnetwork Inference and Deep Learning Project Summary The ability to accurately predict the effect of genetic variation on phenotypes at multiple scales would radically transform our ability to apply genomic technologies in order to understand human health and disease. This predictive ability would significantly improve the effectiveness of a broad spectrum of genomic analyses ranging from genome-wide association studies for common diseases to diagnostic odysseys searching for genetic causes of rare diseases. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a trainable approach for predicting the phenotypic impact of genetic variants. This approach will support predictions for a broad range of genetic variations, phenotypes, and biological contexts. It will incorporate and exploit mechanistic knowledge of pathways where available, but augment this pathway knowledge with learned models where it is not. This approach will consist of a synthesis of (i) methods that link genomic variants to their effect on expression or function of individual gene products, (ii) methods that link those relationships into the subnetworks involved in cellular responses of interest, (iii) machine-learning approaches that infer models pertaining to a variety of genotype-phenotype relations from large training sets. We will also develop and apply active learning algorithms to identify the most informative experiments for subsequent analysis by IGVF Consortium. Additionally, we will develop and apply a statistical framework for elucidating genetic modifiers, through probabilistic, network-informed inference of common variants identified in GWAS that modify the impact of rare variants implicated in sequencing-based association studies. Throughout the project, we will work closely with other IGVF Centers to guide experimental data collection, benchmark methods from across Centers, and contribute to the variant-element-phenotype catalog which will have broad applications by the community. Narrative Being able to characterize the impact of genetic variants on phenotypes is critical for interpreting the roles these variants play in human health and disease.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,10058828,R01DC012049,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Auditory Threshold', 'Biology', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Free Energy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Tests', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Octogenarian', 'Otoscopes', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Presbycusis', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical trial implementation', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'falls', 'gene therapy', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic testing', 'hard of hearing', 'hearing impairment', 'hearing loss phenotype', 'hearing preservation', 'hereditary hearing loss', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'precision genetics', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'research clinical testing', 'software systems', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,508845
"Predictive Modeling of the Functional and Phenotypic Impacts of Genetic Variants PROJECT SUMMARY Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated tens of thousands of common variants with human diseases and traits. The rapid expansion of Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) studies and biobanks offer great potential to understand the physiologic and pathophysiologic associations of both common and rare variants. The IGVF Consortium aims to systematically study the functional and phenotypic effects of genomic variation; it is not, however, feasible to experimentally characterize the vast number of candidate variants of interest. Computational models which can accurately predict the context-specific effects of variants are essential in designing targeted research. We propose an approach anchored on a framework of high-confidence regulatory elements (REs), from which we will develop methods to learn RE-gene links, perform rare variant association tests, and finemap causal common and rare variants. We aim to make all our results, methods, and tools available to the community through a public portal and the NHGRI and NHLBI Data Commons. Our proposal has four aims: (1) Develop a core framework of REs from open chromatin regions on which to anchor our models, improving on past approaches by producing higher-resolution predictions of functional base-pairs, producing novel RE subclassifications using functional characterization datasets from IGVF and other sources, and harnessing single-cell datasets to delineate lineage- and stimulus-specific elements. (2) Use this framework to predict the roles of variants in molecular phenotypes, specifically gene expression and cellular response to stimuli. We will build statistical and machine-learning methods to predict context-specific links between REs and their target genes, using three-dimensional conformation data produced by the IGVF Consortium and external sources. We will apply this method across many cell types and perform feature selection to build a catalog of high-confidence RE-gene links and regulatory networks. (3) Develop statistical methods to perform cell type-specific rare variant association tests (cellSTAAR) in WGS studies, and a latent variable model to prioritize candidate functional variants for traits and diseases, using results from Aims 1 and 2. We will apply these methods to analyze various metabolic, immune-mediated, and psychiatric disorders in the multi-ethnic WGS data of the NHLBI Trans-Omic Precision Medicine Program (TOPMed) and the NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) to identify candidate causal disease-associated variants. (4) Make all the results publicly available by substantially expanding the FAVOR Portal to include whole genome variant functional annotations of all three billion genomic positions as well as cell type-specific annotations. We will implement both FAVOR and cellSTAAR in the Data Commons AnVIL (NHGRI) and BioData Catalyst (NHLBI) so researchers may use them for analysis of new datasets in a scalable cloud computing environment. We will work closely with other centers and the Data Analysis Coordinating Center (DACC) of the IGVF on joint analyses and building the IGVF Variant Catalog. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists have been pinpointing tens of thousands of positions in the human genome which may influence disease. In order to apply this knowledge to improve treatment options and preventative medicine, however, we need to have a better understanding of how these regions function and where in the body they are active.

"Predicting Phenotype by Deep Learning Heterogeneous Multi-Omics Data Project Summary Complex disease and traits are caused by dynamic genetic regulation and environmental interactions. Numerous genetic, genomic, and phenotypic datasets have been generated, including genotypes, gene expression, epigenetic changes, and electronic medical records (EMRs). Currently, there is main challenge on development of novel informatic approaches to effectively link phenotype with genomic information. Specifically, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported several thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with the disease and traits; however, more than 80% of them are noncoding variants, making it difficult to interpret their potential disease-causal roles. We and others have systematically examined how phenotypic variability in disease risk for a broad spectrum of disease phenotypes can be explained by regulatory variants. Now, we hypothesize that such regulation will be in a tissue-specific, cell type-specific and developmental stage-specific (TCD-specific) manner. Importantly, large genomic consortia, like ENCODE, FANTOM5, the Roadmap Epigenomics, and GTEx have continuously generated high-quality functional data for annotating genome-wide variants. The emerging single-cell sequencing technologies have enabled us to examine how genetic variants affect cellular functions within individual cells or specific cell types. This brings us an unprecedented opportunity to develop novel statistical and computational approaches for deep understanding of the genetic architecture of phenotype. In this proposal, we combine bioinformatics, single cell omics, deep learning, and phenotype and EMR data mining to develop novel analytical strategies that maximally leverage information from both genotype and expression from massive heterogeneous data, aiming to predict phenotype by functional assessment of DNA variation at the TCD-specific levels. We propose the following three specific aims. (1) To develop a deep learning method for variant impact predictor, DeepVIP, that maximally utilizes functional and regulatory data to predict the causal roles of variants in complex disease and traits. (2) To develop phenotype-specific network approaches to resolve genotype-phenotype relationships in the spatiotemporal manner and single-cell resolution. We will develop a novel method, single cell dense module search of GWAS signals (scGWAS) and also a graphical neural network approach, GNN-scTP, to detect driving roles of genes from single cell RNA-seq data. These methods can effectively identify critical regulatory modules and genes in complex disease in the TCD-specific manner. (3) To apply the methods to 16 neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders and related traits, as well as broad phenotypes using Vanderbilt biobank (BioVU) and UK Biobank data – both have genotypes linked with rich phenotypic information. Our proposal is timely and innovative to study the genetic architecture in human complex diseases and traits by dissecting important genetic components, especially noncoding variants, at the functional, regulatory, spatial, temporal, and single cell levels. Project Narrative The rapid advances in genome technologies and medical informatics have helped investigators generate huge amount of biological and biomedical data, including genome-wide DNA variation, tissue-specific gene expression, functional genomic annotations, and electronic medical records. To effectively mine such highly dimensional and heterogeneous datasets, we will develop novel computational methods to assess the functional impact of genetic variants in the human genome and study the genetic architecture of complex disease and traits at the regulatory, spatial, temporal, and single cell levels.",Predicting Phenotype by Deep Learning Heterogeneous Multi-Omics Data,10318084,R01LM012806,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Medical Informatics', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Other Genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'heterogenous data', 'human study', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'single cell sequencing', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'web server']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,332649
"Personalized Structural Biology: Enabling Exome Interpretation in Undiagnosed Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Our long-term goal is to establish personalized structural biology – a precision medicine approach for inter- preting clinical sequencing data by jointly modeling all mutations in a patient’s proteome in the context of protein 3D structures, known human genetic variation, and other relevant data. In this project, we will develop the com- putational tools needed to integrate the wealth of available genetic variation data with cutting edge algorithms for efficiently modeling mutations to human protein structures and accurately quantifying their specific functional effects. This will provide a rich characterization of healthy and diseased proteomes and the means to generate actionable hypotheses about the effects of variants of unknown significance in individual patients. To demon- strate the power and relevance of this approach, we will apply it to facilitate variant interpretation in individuals in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). We will then collaborate to validate our predictions.  Our central hypothesis is that achieving the full promise of precision medicine requires the interpretation of a patient’s genetic variants in their 3D structural contexts and the integration of structural and clinical infor- mation. Patient genome interpretation is a major roadblock to fully realizing the transformative potential of per- sonalized medicine in the clinic. Current approaches for characterizing protein-coding variants of unknown sig- nificance have several shortcomings that limit their practical utility. First, they are not personalized; most are trained en masse on databases of known mutations across thousands of individuals. Thus, they are subject to ascertainment bias and ignore the background of other variants present in the individual. Second, most fail to provide specific biologically interpretable and thus therapeutically actionable predictions of a mutation’s effects beyond “benign” or “pathogenic”. Third, they are not stable and similar methods often disagree. Fourth, most are unable to interpret multi-base insertions and deletions. As a result and most importantly, current methods often give insufficient guidance to clinicians and fail to personalize next steps of treatment.  Computational methods for modeling the effects of mutations on protein structures are now sufficiently fast and accurate to provide a solution to these challenges. Building on our expertise in analyzing the effects of mutations and modeling protein structures, the following aims establish a computational framework for interpre- tation of exonic variants that is personalized, clinically relevant, accurate, and applicable to all mutation types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying the genetic variants responsible for patient phenotypes is challenging, especially for rare diseases. We will develop algorithms for interpreting variants of unknown clinical significance by modeling the effects of all variants in a patient on protein 3D structures, integrating structural features with machine learning, and using systems biology to identify functional interactions between variants. In collaboration with the Undiagnosed Dis- eases Network, we will develop and validate mechanistic hypotheses about the genetic basis for disease and establish a foundation for personalized treatments that reflect patients’ unique genetic backgrounds.",Personalized Structural Biology: Enabling Exome Interpretation in Undiagnosed Diseases,10211423,R01LM013434,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Annotation', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Rare Diseases', 'Set protein', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment Step', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'machine learning method', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'structural biology', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'variant of unknown significance']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,354521
"Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing Abstract  Modern genetics has identified many genetic variants that affect traits such as height, but most phenotypic variation still cannot be explained by these variants alone. Importantly, differences in environment often result in individual variation of traits—including disease risk and drug response—for different genotypes. These relationships are known as genotype by environment (GxE) interactions. For example, the sickle cell allele of hemoglobin S causes sickle cell anemia, but also provides a fitness advantage in the presence of malaria by conferring resistance to infection. However, there are few examples where the exact causal variants are known. Therefore, we need to develop new methodology for identifying more of these GxE interactions, to improve prediction of disease risk and treatment outcomes.  In this study, I will fill in the gap of knowledge in GxE interactions by establishing an experimental framework for identifying hundreds of causal GxE variants in parallel, providing the first comprehensive view of GxE causal variant landscape. Specifically, I will study how thousands of genetic variants between a laboratory yeast strain (BY) and a vineyard strain (RM) lead to their differences in growth upon stress and drug treatments, as one form of GxE interaction. In Aim 1, I will use a novel gene-editing technology that can detect the fitness effects of thousands of variants in one experiment, as shown in a pilot experiment. Using this method, I will be able to map hundreds of casual variants that contribute to growth differences under various conditions, such as carbon source, oxidative stress and drug treatment. In Aim 2, I will measure allele-specific mRNA expression (ASE) from BYxRM F1 hybrids in above-mentioned conditions and associate the mapped causal GxE variants, to identify GxE variants that influence growth rate through gene expression. Then, I will apply a machine learning model to predict causal GxE genes using the molecular features found in this study. By mapping causal GxE variants, linking them to gene expression and predicting causal genes through gene expression, I will establish a complete framework for accelerating the discovery of GxE interactions. Public Health Relevance The recent explosion of precision medicine based on genotype and mutations has enabled personalized treatment of diseases. However, how environmental factors influence the outcome of such treatments is not clear. By establishing a framework to study general principles and underlying molecular mechanisms of these gene-by-environment interactions, we will be able to integrate such knowledge in disease risk prediction and personalized treatment.",Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing,10216263,F31ES030282,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Biological Models', 'Carbon', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Height', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactase', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meiotic Recombination', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resolution', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Scientist', 'Sickle Cell', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Hemoglobin', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'career', 'causal variant', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mRNA Expression', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'precise genome editing', 'precision medicine', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'segregation', 'skills', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,30036
"Molecular determinants of pathogenicity in viral conjunctivitis ABSTRACT  Adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis is one of the most common conditions in all of medicine. Despite being a common cause of morbidity world-wide, there are no known host or pathogen factors that predict clinical outcomes in this condition. A recent, large, international clinical study of adenovirus-related conjunctivitis revealed that approximately 10% of patients suffer from long term visual loss. A limited deep DNA sequencing study of AdV D8 clinical samples conducted under our previous R21 (1R21EY027453) revealed unexpected sequence diversity in the viral genome, with approximately 600 sequence variants among 87 samples within the same hexon-defined molecular type. These variants assorted into three subtypes with different propensity to poor outcome. Remarkably, using machine learning approaches, we found we were able to predict one critical outcome – the development of subepithelial infiltrates – from knowledge of the viral sequence alone.  Our previous study sequenced samples from the placebo arm of the NVC-422 clinical trial. We have an additional 157 AdV D8 samples that have not been sequenced. In Aim 1 we propose sequencing the adenovirus of these samples in order to a.) further characterize the sequence diversity of AdV D8 and b.) validate our machine learning method for predicting development of subeptithelial infiltrates While AdV D8 was the most prevalent cause of AKC in our study worldwide, unexpectedly we found in the United States that AdV E4 was the most prevalent type. In Aim 2, we propose fully sequencing all 36 samples in the study from type E4, as well as 23 samples from type B3, 9 samples from D19, and a total of 35 samples distributed between type D53, D56, and D64 to determine their molecular diversity, and to apply the same machine learning methods to this set of samples to determine if outcomes can be predicted from viral sequence variants for these types as for AdVD8. The results of these studies will expand our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of viral conjunctivitis, and will provide biomarkers for predicting outcomes from this condition. These advances will facilitate future efforts toward developing therapies for this common condition. NARRATIVE Adenovirus-related conjunctivitis, one of the most common conditions in all of medicine, can lead to a long- term visual loss in a significant portion of patients. We propose to use next generation DNA sequencing to catalog the molecular variants of adenovirus, determine their association with outcomes, and determine the molecular strains of virus associated with poor clinical outcomes.",Molecular determinants of pathogenicity in viral conjunctivitis,10313229,R21EY033174,"['Adenoviruses', 'Blindness', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complication', 'Conjunctivitis', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Heterogeneity', 'International', 'Keratoconjunctivitis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prognosis', 'Public Health', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shotguns', 'Swab', 'TPD52L1 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Conjunctivitis', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Genome', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virus', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'arm', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'ocular surface', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'therapy development', 'viral genomics', 'whole genome']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2021,220625
"A Multivariate Mediation and Deep Learning Framework for Genome-Connectome -Substance Use Research Substance use and addiction are complex biopsychosocial disorders influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. A key challenge in addiction genetics research is to understand how multiple genetic variants interactively influence addiction traits through impacting the central nervous system. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale mediation analysis framework to identify addiction-related gene-brain circuitry pathways, using nicotine addiction as the targeted disorder, although the platform will be readily applicable for other addiction-related disorders and phenotypes. We will fully leverage the complex and interactive interdependent relationships between the imaging-genetics data and perform multivariate statistical inference with simultaneously increased statistical power and reduce false positive rates. The results will precisely identify multiple sets of genetic variants that interactively alter brain functional and structural circuitries, and then influence nicotine addiction. We will further supplement the mediation results with deep learning algorithms to study how genetic variants non-linearly and interactively coordinate to influence nicotine addiction and explain the phenotypic variance. Novel network topology based convolutional and pooling functions will be developed to achieve optimal prediction accuracy of addiction traits using genome-connectome pathways. All models and findings will be carefully validated through multiple independent large-sample data sets of imaging-genetics studies for nicotine addiction for ensuring the replicability and reliability of our findings derived from this framework. We plan to produce a freely available and user-friendly software incorporating the mediation analysis framework and deep learning algorithms enabling the complex whole genome - connectome analysis for addiction genetics research. Nicotine addiction is a worldwide public health priority and imposing health and economic burden on millions of individuals and families. This proposal seeks to identify how multiple genetic variants interactively influence the nicotine addiction through impacting brain circuitries.

"Genetics of oxycodone intake in a hybrid rat diversity panel. The steady rise in prescription opioids such as oxycodone has led to widespread abuse and deaths in the US. importance of drug pharmacokinetics in determining abuse potential, we have designed an oral operant rat self-administration (SA) procedure to model the pattern of drug intake of most human users/abusers of oxycodone, who initiate using oral tablets. Although genetic variants play important roles in susceptibility to opioid addiction, very limited data are available regarding specific genes and sequence variants that predispose to opioid addiction, and under what conditions. Given the We propose to use an innovative hybrid rat diversity panel (HRDP), which consists of 91 diverse rat genomes, to identify genetic variants influencing operant oxycodone intake in rats. The HRDP is unique in that it: 1) contains a high level of genetic diversity similar to that of human populations; 2) provides a way to control oxycodone exposure and to systematically study gene-by-environment and gene-by-drug interactions; and 3) integrates multi-omics ""addictome"" data: from genetics to epigenomics to brain connectomes to treatments. We have three aims: Aim 1: We will analyze whole genome sequencing data to define virtually all sequence variants that underlie heritable variations. De novo assemblies will be conducted using linked-reads data for selected high impact strains. Hi-C data (Dovetail Genomics) will be generated to further improve the quality of these assemblies. We will also generate RNA-seq data for key brain regions to obtain mechanistic insights into oxycodone intake. Aim 2: Using the HRDP (both sexes), we will phenotype oral oxycodone SA with a unique behavioral model. Rats will also be tested for sensitivity to pain, social behaviors, and anxiety-like traits - all signs of oxycodone withdrawal. Critically, we estimated the heritability (h2) of oxycodone intake in the range of 0.3 – 0.4. When using n=6/sex, the effective h2 is ~0.8 —sufficient for high precision mapping. Aim 3: We will use systems genetics methods to map and integrate behavioral phenotypes with sequence and transcriptome data. Both forward (QTL) and reverse (PheWAS) genetic methods will be used. We use new linear mixed models to map and test candidate genes with key cofactors using the GeneNetwork2 platform. Finally, we evaluate the translational relevance of candidate genes and biomarkers by comparison to GWAS cohorts and longitudinal reports of addiction in humans. Technical and conceptual advances that underlie this application are: new genomic methods combined with highly diverse rat populations allow us to quickly define novel gene variants that modulate key phases of opiate addiction. It is highly likely that a subset of variants and molecular networks we define will provide key components of a predictive framework linking sequence differences to human opioid addiction and potential treatments. This project uses new systems genetics approaches, open source genomic data and software, and a new type of hybrid rodent mapping panel to precisely define causal linkages between DNA variation and voluntary oxycodone intake. The U.S. has declared a national public health emergency to combat the current opioid crisis that is causing over 30,000 deaths per year.

"Functional genetic variants in substance use disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this study is to identify functional genetic variants that are associated with SUDs, and thereby contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying these devastating disorders. Our overall objectives are to (i) design and implement a series of experimental methods to assess the impact of genetic variants relevant to SUDs and related traits and computational models to predict the impact of additional variants, and (ii) establish a statistical genetics framework to more effectively identify additional genes that contribute to the disorders. This proposal builds upon our previous studies on the role of genomic variation in gene regulation and will generate new data to combine with existing multi-omics data and modeling. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Identify functional genetic variants that contribute to the risk for substance use disorders and related phenotypes by affecting gene regulation, using a series of high-throughput reporter assays to evaluate the impact of tens of thousands of non- coding variations in enhancers, promoters and 3’UTRs on gene expression in eight cell lines representing four major cell types in brain (neurons, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes). Variants with a modest association with substance use disorders and related traits will be selected from the GWAS catalog and experiments underway. Data on the initial large sets of variants will be used to predict, using machine learning approaches, the functional impact of additional regulatory variants. A large subset of the variants predicted to be functional will then be tested with follow-up HTRAs, and the predictive models refined based upon the data. 2. Identify genes whose expression changes contribute to the risk for SUDs. We will use Mendelian Randomization-based methods based on the data derived from Aim 1 plus GWAS data from the PGC and other large consortia to identify causal genes whose expression changes in specific cell types contribute to SUD-related phenotypes. Upon completion of these studies, we will have created a unique, accessible resource of SUD-associated genetic variants that regulate target gene expression in specific brain cell types. These genes can serve as high priority candidates for future functional and animal-based studies. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of high-throughput reporter assays and computational methods for prioritizing causal genetic variants and identifying driver genes that contribute to the risk for substance use disorders. This is directly relevant to the missions of NIH to improve the capability of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these devastating disorders.

"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, meeting recruitment objectives and taking roles in IBDGC leadership positions. Our particular focus is on African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population. In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation, evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants, and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk. The proposed research focuses on (1) assessing the specific functions of key GDF5 regulatory sequences in knee development and cartilage maintenance in mice and humans, (2) the association of genetic variants in GDF5 locus with osteoarthritis knee shape, and (3) the impacts that human GDF5 risk mutations have on chondrocyte and joint biology.",Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis,10179320,R01AR070139,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Differentiation and Growth', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Haplotypes', 'High Prevalence', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Veins', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'cartilage cell', 'causal variant', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'morphogens', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prenatal', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'spatiotemporal', 'whole genome']",NIAMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,612601
"Using Genetic Diversity to Manage Neurological Disease Project Summary/Abstract Understanding and treating genome abnormalities that lead to rare genetic neurodegenerative diseases such as Niemann-Pick C1 globally managing cholesterol homeostasis, or APOE alleles impacting cholesterol homeostasis in the brain triggering late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), present a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We have developed a Gaussian process regression (GPR) based machine learning (ML) approach that captures for the first time genomic variation in the population to understand the spatial covariance (SCV) relationships contributing to sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual. Genetic disease is fundamentally a problem of understanding the impact of altered folding intermediates found in response to variation in the protein fold and how they are managed by proteostasis. Proteostasis encompasses a broad range of chaperone and degradative components that manage the synthesis, folding/stability and function of the protein fold in response to inherited and environmental stress and aging. The general premise of this proposal is to develop a deep genome-based understanding of proteostasis that will teach us how to manage genetic diseases triggered by folding stress. The rationale for this proposal is that sparse genetic diversity found in the population, when used as a collective through application of GRP-ML defined SCV relationships, can provide us on a residue-by-residue basis insight into the folding intermediates that contribute to disease for the entire polypeptide sequence. The objective of this proposal is to understand the role of proteostasis in managing this genetic diversity for the benefit of therapeutic intervention. We hypothesize that management of the polypeptide fold of disease-causing variant proteins found in the population by targeting the function of the multivalent Hsp40 and Hsp70 co-chaperone/chaperone branch (the Hsp70 axis) of the proteostasis network will enable precision correction of misfolding phenotypes found in neurodegenerative disease. Our approach will study the impact of variation in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene. NPC1 is an inherited, autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomal (LE) and lysosome (Ly) compartments of all cell types. The primary effect of NPC1 variation results in early onset neurodegenerative disease in response to loss of cholesterol homeostasis. In Aim 1 we will explore the ability of small molecules to allosterically regulate the activity of components of the Hsp70 axis to retune the synthesis, folding/stability, trafficking and/or function of NPC1 variants. In Aim 2 we will explore the molecular mechanism of action (MoA) of the Hsp70 axis components that are responsible for enabling NPC1 variant correction. Completion of both aims will generate a comprehensive assessment of the role of Hsp70 axis in NPC1 disease progression and will be used as a guide for advancement of a precision medicine approach to reduce or prevent the onset of neurodegenerative disease triggered by genomic variation in NPC1 population. Project Narrative Understanding the mechanism behind and treatment of genome abnormalities in the population that cause rare genetic disease in the individual represents a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We will study the impact of genetic variation found in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene, that, like APOE alleles driving late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD), is responsible for management of cholesterol homeostasis. We will use Gaussian process regression machine learning (GPR-ML) based spatial covariance (SCV) tools to define the mechanism of action of proteostasis components found in the Hsp70 axis to therapeutically manage the NPC1 fold leading to improved to cholesterol homeostasis in the individual to provide basic and clinical insight into disease management.",Using Genetic Diversity to Manage Neurological Disease,10100560,R01AG070209,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Sciences', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Cholesterol Homeostasis', 'Clinical', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'GRP gene', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heat-Shock Proteins 70', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Action', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Niemann-Pick Diseases', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Ubiquitin', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'biochemical tools', 'biophysical tools', 'cell type', 'cholesterol control', 'druggable target', 'early onset', 'fitness', 'genomic variation', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'polypeptide', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein misfolding', 'proteostasis', 'rare genetic disorder', 'rare variant', 'response', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,443750
"lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data PROJECT SUMMARY The onset of most human disease involves numerous molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway, and treatment contexts. This system is probed by thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, and integrative analysis of these data can generate testable hypotheses identifying causal genetic variants and linking them to network level changes in cells to disease phenotypes. This can enable deeper molecular-level understanding of pathophysiology, paving the way to genome-based precision medicine.  The long term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through integrative analysis of high- throughput biological data in a disease context. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration methods, created algorithms for the prediction of disease genes through context-specific and mechanistic network models and analysis of quantitative genetics data, and made novel insights into important biological processes and diseases. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by building public interactive systems capable of real-time user-driven integration that are popular among experimental biologists.  We now propose to connect these gene-level functional network approaches with the underlying genomic variation by deciphering how genomic variants lead to specific transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects. We propose to develop ab initio sequence-level models capable of predicting biochemical effects of any genomic variant (including rare or never observed) on chromatin state and RNA regulation, then link these effects with gene-level regulatory consequences (including tissue-specific transcription and RNA splicing), and finally put genomic sequence directly into the network context via a statistical approach for detecting genes and network neighborhoods with a significantly elevated mutational burden in disease. Our key deliverable will be a user- friendly, interactive web-based framework enabling systems-level variant impact analysis in a network context and an open source library for computational scientists. In addition to systematic analysis across contexts and diseases, we will collaborate with experimentalists to apply our methods to Alzheimer’s, autism spectrum disorders, chronic kidney disease, immune diseases, and congenital heart defects as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to directly contribute to better understanding of these diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE To pave the way for mechanistic interpretation of disease in the genomic context and eventually, precision medicine, we will develop algorithms for de novo prediction of functional biochemical effects of noncoding variants at the DNA regulation and RNA processing levels and then build frameworks for sequence-based prediction of tissue-specific transcription and post-transcriptional RNA processes (starting with splicing). To facilitate discovery of disease mechanisms, we will develop approaches for analyzing these variant effects in a network context, including those developed in the previous grant period (mechanistic and functional networks) and novel network models that integrate exon usage information or enhancer-gene interactions. In addition to verifying top predictions experimentally in our group or by our collaborators in case study areas of neurodegenerative disease, chronic kidney disease, ASD, and congenital heart disease, we will make our methods available to the broader biomedical community through public, interactive user interfaces and open source libraries.",lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,10192732,R01GM071966,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histones', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunology', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'congenital heart disorder', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput analysis', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,448294
"Massively-parallel functional interrogation of genetic variation in LGMD-associated sarcoglycan genes PROJECT SUMMARY Mutations in α-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycan cause sarcoglyanopathies, a subset of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) with devastating effects for patients including muscle wasting, progressive weakness, degeneration of skeletal muscle and often premature death. Accurately diagnosing patients with LGMD before symptom onset or early in the course of the disease has the potential to enable the use of preventative gene therapy or other therapeutics and in the majority of cases can only be done in presymptomatic cases through genetic testing. When a new DNA variant in one of these genes is observed in a patient, however, there is often insufficient evidence to classify it as pathogenic. Within this study, we will use a new approach to express and characterize every possible missense variant in the SGCA, SGCB, SGCG and SGCD genes to advance our understanding of sarcoglycan biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the SGC genes, and advance LGMD care and treatments. We will employ deep mutational scanning, a method for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. We will express a library of all possible SGC missense variants in cultured human cells and measure the effect of each by exploiting a simple but robust characteristic of pathogenic SGC gene variants, disruption of proper protein trafficking. Our two aims are: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible SGC missense variant on SGC protein trafficking and membrane localization, and 2) Predict and validate the pathogenicity of every possible SGC missense variant by integrating multiple functional assays from Aim 1 to create a pathogenicity score for each variant and by confirming variant predictions biochemically using tissue samples from LGMD patients with VUS. These aims will reveal how each possible missense variant in SGC genes impact expression, transport, function or interaction with other SGC proteins. The functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of SGC variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand sarcoglycan biology, improve the clinical translation of sarcoglycanopathies and LGMD using genetic information, and inform new treatments. The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in a subset of Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies caused by mutations in the sarcoglycan genes SGCA, SGCB, SGCD and SGCG. We propose to use an integrated experimental and computational approach that combines multiple high-throughput assays of protein trafficking and function and machine-learning to generate pathogenicity predictions for all possible single- nucleotide variants in these SGC genes and then to validate our predictions in primary tissue samples from patients with SGC variants.",Massively-parallel functional interrogation of genetic variation in LGMD-associated sarcoglycan genes,10193457,R21AR078942,"['Archives', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fostering', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'International', 'Libraries', 'Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Registries', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sarcoglycans', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Soluble Guanylate Cyclase', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical referral center', 'clinical translation', 'delta Sarcoglycan', 'gamma Sarcoglycan', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mutation screening', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'premature', 'protein function', 'protein transport', 'tool', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIAMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,207900
"Clinical Diagnostic Sequencing of Structural Variation ABSTRACT Emerging genomic medicine initiatives are poised to impact prenatal and pediatric diagnostics, including assessment of fetal structural anomalies (FSAs) from amniocentesis and the rapid adoption of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS). Indeed, the rapid decrease in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) costs and the improved sophistication of analytic genomics methods has brought prenatal screening to a critical inflection point. Ongoing studies find improved diagnostic yields from WGS and whole exome sequencing (WES) over conventional karyotype and microarray (CMA); however, the technical, analytical, and interpretative challenges presented by structural variants (SVs) continue to confound sequence-based diagnostics. The field lacks standardized methods to interpret SVs from WGS and WES, yet these variants underlie a significant fraction of prenatal diagnoses, particularly for high risk fetuses with multiple congenital anomalies (MCAs). Our clinical SV program was initially formed to nucleate expertise in technology and algorithm development, variant interpretation, maternal-fetal medicine, and large-scale references to explore the impact of high-resolution SV detection in prenatal diagnostics. This resubmission builds upon the methods, resources, and discoveries from those studies to establish uniform approaches to jointly discover and interpret SVs, initially from amniocentesis and ultimately using non-invasive methods. We will focus on MCAs as exemplars of genomic diagnostics in severe clinical referrals. The discoveries from our initial funding period collectively suggest several critical advances could transform prenatal screening and genetic diagnostics, and we directly address three major barriers to these advances in this renewal: (1) Diagnostic yields from WES in FSAs are highly variable due to inconsistent methods and limited sensitivity to capture SVs. Aim 1 will benchmark diagnostic yields from WGS in MCA cases using our standardized open-source pipelines. (2) The genes contributing to the most severe fetal anomalies in humans remain largely unknown, as studies of MCAs have mostly been restricted to small cohorts and low-resolution CMA methods. Aim 2 will aggregate these severe fetal anomalies and perform uniform variant detection and joint association analyses of short variants and SVs from WES and WGS in FSA trios across multiple consortia, which we will compare to population-scale aggregated controls. (3) NIPS is ultra-low resolution and fails to capture most causal variant classes underlying MCAs. Aim 3 will benchmark an innovative approach to detect coding mutations and SVs from cffDNA, comparing yields to current NIPS and amniocentesis as the standard-of-care. Our team will thus leverage complementary expertise, novel methods, and unique patient resources to advance routine genomic screening in prenatal diagnostics. NARRATIVE This project brings together a team of experts in genetics, genomics, and maternal fetal medicine to introduce whole-genome sequencing as a viable first-tier diagnostic test for fetuses with severe structural anomalies detected on ultrasound. Our team will leverage novel methods for prenatal genetic testing of fetal samples from amniocentesis and excess tissue from the most severe extremes of fetal developmental anomalies in humans. Our goal will be to characterize all classes of point mutations and structural variants, and support the introduction of routine genomic screening in fetal samples from both invasive and non-invasive procedures.",Clinical Diagnostic Sequencing of Structural Variation,10299159,R01HD081256,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Amniocentesis', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base Sequence', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benchmarking', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Fetal Structures', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Karyotype', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Standardization', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'algorithm development', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'cell free fetal DNA', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'congenital anomaly', 'cost', 'de novo mutation', 'dosage', 'early screening', 'exome sequencing', 'fetal', 'gene discovery', 'genetic testing', 'genome sequencing', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'machine learning method', 'neonatal death', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'programs', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'uptake', 'variant detection', 'whole genome']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,732837
"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",10101662,R01HL086694,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic approach', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'multi-ethnic', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,564082

The applicant has previously completed a Master's Degree in Mathematics, and has had extensive instruction in general computational biology. This unique melding of high-level computational expertise and interest in applied genomics has led to the development of this innovative project. He is now being co-mentored by Drs. Barash and Bhoj to gain complementary practical training in predictive algorithm development and molecular genetics. In both his clinical and research interests he is dedicated to improving the rate of molecular diagnosis for children with rare Mendelian disorders. His short-term goals include developing and refining his skills in RNA splicing prediction and human genetic variation analysis in exome and genome data. In addition, he will gain new insight into experimental design, data interpretation, and scientific communication skills to ensure his successful post-doctoral transition. His co-mentors for the proposal are Drs. Yoseph Barash and Elizabeth Bhoj, international leaders in computational genomics and molecular genetics. In addition he will be supported by outstanding resources of the MSTP at Penn, which has an extensive proven track record of successful previous awardees.  The applicant has been pursuing work in creating an improved computational pipeline for the analysis of variants from exome and genome data. Specifically he is capturing the intronic and synonymous variants that are generally removed from the analysis pipeline because of the difficulty in determining the pathogenicity of such variants. As there are many intronic and synonymous variants that are known to cause Mendelain disorders, this clearly leads to missed diagnoses. In Aim 1 he will generate an interpretable algorithm for prioritizing general splicing variants that guides functional validation. In Aim 2 he will identify novel variants and genes for mechanistic evaluation in the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies. This algorithm will be generally applicable, significantly enhancing our ability to provide molecular diagnoses for all patients with suspected Mendelian disorders.

"Large scale genome sequencing and integrative analyses to define genomic predictors of recurrent pregnancy loss SUMMARY: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) occurs in approximately 5% of clinically recognized pregnancy losses. The etiology of RPL is not well characterized: after excluding the known etiologies, approximately half of women with RPL still have no identifiable cause. The fact that RPL is, in fact, recurrent suggests a strong genetic component, however there is currently a very limited understanding of the genomic contributions to RPL. Previous studies are typically deficient in their design, limited by small sample size, incomplete clinical phenotyping and/or the recruitment of singletons only. In this proposal, we put forward our plan to recruit 1000 rigorously-phenotyped RPL trios including from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds across the US and to apply WGS and sophisticated variant detection and interpretation methods developed by our labs to identify pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants for RPL. We will then perform comprehensive integrative data analyses to define the genetic basis of unexplained RPL and map the genes and regions of the chromosome that are absolutely required for human development and a successful pregnancy. Our variant interpretation pipeline includes cutting edge approaches to map likely pathogenic noncoding and structural variants rarely assessed in any pregnancy loss study. We will also perform a pilot RNA-seq study to assess the utility of this approach for gene discovery in the pregnancy loss setting. We will first look for recessive pathogenic variation, including compound heterozygosity and then test for models for de novo mosaicism, mitochondrial mutations, regulatory noncoding variation and overall mutational burden. From these combined analyses, we expect to uncover many variants in genes and regions of the chromosome that are intolerable to functional variation, which we define as the human intolerome. We will build on our previous studies to map the intolerome by combining i) available data from all clinical studies to define the genetic etiology of unexplained pregnancy loss, including data generated in this proposal and in our prior work, ii) network-based approaches to prioritize variants genes important for human development and pregnancy, iii) mouse (KOMP, DMDD/MGI) and cell line knockout studies iv) rare and common disease sequencing studies including Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMG), Center for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG) and Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), iv) emerging human pangenome studies HPP, and v) population-scale biobank projects such as UK BioBank and All of Us. We will then confirm these predictions via collaborator-led functional studies and retrospective analyses of RPL first losses, siblings and grandparents. The sharing of early, unpublished data from the Yale CMG and HPP enabled by our leadership in these projects is a significant strength of what will be by far the largest and most comprehensive study of RPL performed to date. Our findings will take great strides towards the goal of comprehensively mapping the human intolerome and will further expand and refine the exploratory space in which to investigate the genes and chromosomal regions essential for human development. Project Narrative The proposed study is to conduct a large scale genomic discovery of recurrent pregnancy loss using an integrated and innovative genomics approach and construct an intolerome to guide the evaluation of pregnancy loss in clinic and studies of the human early development.",Large scale genome sequencing and integrative analyses to define genomic predictors of recurrent pregnancy loss,10226657,R01HD105267,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Conceptions', 'Counseling', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fathers', 'Fetal Development', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Human Genetics', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Mosaicism', 'Mothers', 'Mouse Cell Line', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy loss', 'Recurrence', 'Reproductive Health', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'gene discovery', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic variation', 'grandparent', 'human pangenome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'recruit', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'variant detection', 'whole genome']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,500000
"Functional Characterization of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Complex Traits Understanding the molecular and organismal function of genetic variants in non-coding regions is crucial to dissect the genetic and evolutionary basis of variation in complex traits. Combining complementary functional genomics datasets has proven a successful strategy to pinpoint the most likely causal variant and molecular mechanism supporting a genetic association. Current existing annotations only capture regulatory conditions at the baseline level. However, as we and others have shown, the effect of a genetic variant on a molecular pathway, and ultimately on the individual's phenotype, may be modulated by the cellular environmental context (gene-environment interactions, GxE). We deﬁne these genetic variants as GxE quantitative trait nucleotides (GxE-QTNs) and consider the cellular environment as a simpliﬁed but better controlled proxy of the organismal environment. Binding of TFs to speciﬁc genomic targets is deﬁned by sequence motifs and chromatin epige- netic marks, and can be altered by the presence of GxE-QTNs. To discover genes modulated by GxE-QTNs, we have recently established a high-throughput approach to perturb the cellular environment by a panel of 50 in vitro treatments, including vitamins, metal ions, common drugs and hormones. Here we propose to use this approach to dissect these GxE-QTNs and the underlying molecular mechanism by: i) performing functional ge- nomics assays capturing chromatin accessibility; ii) analyzing the effects of naturally occurring genetic variation in regulatory elements; and iii) combining RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, MPRA and GWAS data to co-localize association signals and pinpoint complex traits causal variants. The purpose of this project is to improve our understanding of the mechanistic links between genetic variation, epigenetic factors and differences in gene regulation across environmental contexts. This work will provide a useful resource to any researcher interested in gene by environment interactions in human complex traits, whether within the range of natural variation or in the pathological spectrum.",Functional Characterization of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Complex Traits,10172918,R01GM109215,"['ATAC-seq', 'Alleles', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell model', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Ions', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Proxy', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'causal variant', 'convolutional neural network', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'interest', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'quasar', 'response', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,297237
"Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants ABSTRACT Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing of complex diseases have revealed a plethora of disease risk variants, most of which lie in noncoding regions of DNA without easily interpretable function. A main functional mechanism of noncoding variants is to alter chromatin accessibility to transcription factors (TFs), thereby influencing gene expression. Predicting the effects of noncoding variants on TF binding and gene expression on a large scale is thus important but remains challenging. Available computational tools for predicting regulatory variants largely rely on TF-binding motif models and/or local chromatin modification features. Here, we aim to develop a novel computational framework to address two major limitations of these methods. First, given that known disease causal noncoding variants often reside outside of TF binding motifs, how can we improve the prediction of TF binding variants outside of motifs? For this, we plan to integrate TF ChIP-seq data with features that are important for TF binding but have not been considered in previous methods, in particular the DNA breathing dynamics (AIM1). DNA breathing reflects local transient opening of the DNA double helix due to thermal fluctuations. We have shown that genetic variants can affect nearby (up to a few hundred base pairs) DNA breathing dynamics that affect TF binding. Using TF ChIP-seq data, we will train models that predict specific TF binding variants in or outside TF motifs, incorporating DNA breathing dynamics with other features such as DNA shapes and cooperative TF binding. Secondly, given that chromatin features only show modest (<2-fold) enrichment of genetic variants associated with complex diseases or traits, how can we improve the prediction of regulatory variants? For this, we will build a computation model, considering the allele-specific chromatin accessibility (ASCA; i.e., two alleles of a heterozygous individual show read imbalance in chromatin accessibility assays) as a functional readout of a regulatory variant (AIM2). We have shown that neuronal ASCA SNPs are highly enriched for those implicated by schizophrenia (SZ) GWAS. Using neuronal ASCA data, we will train models that predict variants with regulatory effects, taking advantage of our TF-specific classifiers (from AIM1). As a proof of concept, the models will be applied to a large SZ GWAS dataset to predict putative causal regulatory variants. We will validate the effects of the predicted top-ranking regulatory SZ variants on gene expression in a well-powered hiPSC sample by combining multiplex CRISPR-based SNP editing and single-cell RNA-seq analysis (AIM3). For SNPs showing the strongest regulatory effects, we will further use CRISPR editing to verify the SNP effect on gene expression and disease-relevant neuronal phenotypes. Accurately predicting TF-affecting noncoding variants will enable better understanding of the large number of noncoding variants implicated in complex disorders and help formulate testable biological hypotheses, ultimately facilitating the development of targeted therapeutics. NARRATIVE We will develop novel computational methods and a cost-effective functional validation approach to systematically infer the effect of disease-associated noncoding variants on transcription factor binding and gene expression. Identifying the functional noncoding variants that are associated with disease risk will help illuminate causal molecular mechanisms, facilitating the clinical translation of genetic findings into disease risk prediction and treatment.",Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants,10115126,R01MH116281,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adenine', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cell Line', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Classification', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'chromatin modification', 'clinical translation', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost effective', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'support vector machine', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIMH,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2021,605699
"Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP) The advent of next generation DNA sequencing has revolutionized gene discovery in human diseases, including epilepsy. Hundreds of genes have been implicated in epilepsy in the last decade, revealing the diversity of biological mechanisms that can go awry in this disorder. However, the rate at which we are identifying new genes involved in epilepsy is now outpacing our ability to study disease mechanisms. Moreover, clinical gene panel or exome sequencing has become standard practice for patients with early-onset, familial, and refractory epilepsies. This rapid assimilation of genetic testing into clinical care has led to a surge in the number of genetic variants of uncertain significance (VUS), particularly the occurrence of missense VUS. These VUS are assigned to an indeterminate spectrum between pathogenic and benign, which complicate interpretation for genetic counselors, clinicians, patients and families, as well as assessment of the need for further testing. Here we propose a Center without Walls, entitled Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP), spanning 5 institutions and incorporating expertise from geneticists, clinicians, computational biologists, neuroscientists, stem cell biologists, pharmacologists and electrophysiologists who have a proven track record of collaborative publications and grants, as well as stature as leaders of national and international epilepsy organizations. EpiMVP will develop a modular, highly integrated platform approach to accelerate determination of the functional, pharmacological, neuronal network and whole animal consequences of genetic variants implicated in a range of clinical epilepsy types. We will study non-ion-channel, non-receptor genes commonly implicated in epilepsy, and that are involved in diverse biological processes. Our ultimate goals are to devise an effective experimental platform for testing the pathogenicity of VUS in genes implicated in epilepsy and to generate a computational model (EpiPred) that predicts the likelihood that a variant is pathogenic or benign. This work is crucial in the pursuit of novel therapeutics and the promise of personalized medicine. The overall milestones of the Center are: 1. Evaluate genes associated with epilepsy and select candidates for analysis, model data for, and analyze all project data for development of EpiPred an iterative machine learning model to classify variants in genes implicated in epilepsy. 2. Test selected VUS using medium throughput, in vitro approaches. 3. Test selected VUS in human cortical neurons or human brain organoids using induced pluripotent stem cell approaches. 4. Test selected VUS in pre-clinical, in vivo models. The expected outcomes are: 1. Provide a freely available prediction tool for clinicians to differentiate between pathogenic and benign variants for genes implicated in epilepsy; 2. Provide experimental models to study the functional consequences of specific variants; 3. Provide a reclassification of VUS in ClinVar/ClinGen and to develop new guidelines for incorporating functional readouts into the ACMG criteria; 4. Inform the future development of novel therapeutics to treat epilepsy.

"Integrative approaches to identification and interpretation of genes underlying psychiatric disorders Psychiatric disorders contribute substantially to the disease burden in the United States and worldwide. There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to many psychiatric illnesses. In recent years, with the advancement of high throughput genomic technologies and the availability of large samples, remarkable success has been made in risk gene discovery for major psychiatric disorders [e.g., schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)] through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, due to the high complexity of the human genome, few causal genes or variants have been identified within GWAS risk loci, thus, to date, limiting the potential of translating these genetic findings into biological mechanisms. There is now a great need to pinpoint causal genes/variants at the known GWAS risk loci and to understand their causal mechanisms, as well as to discover novel genes from novel risk loci. There is also growing evidence that risk variants from GWAS tend to be located in regulatory DNA regions in disease-relevant tissues or cell types, suggesting that risk variants may act through regulation of gene expression. Studies leveraging diverse functional genomic resources may benefit psychiatric risk gene discovery and result in better prediction of their biological relevance. This proposal aims to employ highly integrative approaches to identify causal genes and regulatory noncoding variants underlying SCZ, BD, and MDD. Our specific aims are: 1) Integrate GWAS with brain methylome for risk gene discovery, by leveraging a dense high-resolution reference panel of DNAm from whole genome bisulfite sequencing of DNA from three different brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and caudate) and an enlarged array-based reference panel; 2) Apply a deep learning approach to predicting disease-relevant regulatory variants, by employing features from disease-relevant gene regulatory networks and functional genomic annotations within brain tissues and neural cell types; and 3) Map prioritized genes and variants to specific brain cell types and brain function. We have assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary team with expertise in psychiatric genetics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and neuroimaging. Our goal is to apply multidisciplinary and cutting-edge analytical strategies to help address the challenges arising in the post-GWAS era. The identification and characterization of risk genes and noncoding regulatory variants would help improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie psychiatric illnesses, moving us closer to designing effective prevention and treatment for these disorders.

"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome Genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many heritable diseases including congenital long- QT syndrome (LQTS). However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of ‘variants of unknown significance’ (VUS) for which there is insufficient data to determine whether a particular variant is benign or pathogenic. The emergence of widespread clinical genetic testing and the use of next-generation sequencing in research have caused explosive growth in the number of known variants associated with disease traits and in populations. The goal of this project is to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS and related genetic arrhythmia syndromes. We will focus on two potassium channel subunit genes, KCNQ1 and KCNE1, which are associated with LQTS, short-QT syndrome and familial atrial fibrillation. The ability to discern reliably whether a variant is a true risk factor would be transformative, improving patient care by avoiding unnecessary or potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign variants, guiding therapy of true mutation carriers and improving family counseling. During the prior period of support, we implemented and optimized a high throughput experimental strategy to determine the functional consequences of ~110 KCNQ1 variants located in the KCNQ1 voltage-sensing domain (VSD) (Aim 1). In parallel, we elucidated the stability, structural properties, and cell surface expression of ~50 KCNQ1 VSD variants and deduced a previously unrecognized functional domain in the channel (S0 segment; Aim 2). Using data from the literature and from Aims 1-2, we developed, trained and tested a computational predictor for estimating the likelihood of channel dysfunction caused by KCNQ1 variants that performs better than other variant prediction algorithms (Aim 3). Together our work provides a new paradigm for addressing the emerging challenge of genetic variant classification. In the next funding period, we propose to continue this novel multidisciplinary paradigm to evaluate ~200 additional KCNQ1 variants at the functional and structural levels with an emphasis on variants in the pore domain and C-terminus, to investigate the functional and structural consequences of all known KCNE1 variants (~110), examine the impact of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 variants on intersubunit binding, and to develop an advanced computational pathogenicity predictor. Our study will yield a large and unprecedented database of functional, structural and biochemical properties of hundreds of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 variants along with an advanced, data-trained computational prediction algorithm capable of accurately discriminating deleterious from benign variants. These results will contribute to improving the accuracy of LQTS genetic test interpretation and improve medical decision-making for LQTS.

"ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders Project Abstract:  Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) editing plays a major role in shaping transcriptome diversity by creating variant isoforms that enable fine-tuning of calcium-mediated excitatory and other signaling needed for brain development, neural plasticity and mood regulation. The spatio-temporal ADAR editing landscapes are tightly regulated by controlling ADAR expression levels to preserve preferential binding and editing. Previous studies have shown that activation of the interferon pathways of the innate immune system – such as those seen in viral infections - leads to increased expression of ADAR1p150, which ultimately results in changes to ADAR editing patterns. Furthermore, common side effects to innate immune activation by interferon alpha therapies include increased risk of depression and suicide. The changes in spatio-temporal regulation of editing patterns can lead to a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms, including neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., decreased ADAR editing in the serotonin receptor subunit2C in the prefrontal cortex observed in individuals who commit suicide). Yet, our understanding of ADAR editing landscapes remain cursory. Advances in high throughput RNA-seq enable more accurate variant calling from the sequencing reads, providing a way to map ADAR editing patterns in the transcriptome. However, there are no computational pipelines focused on ADAR editing that are easy to use, are reproducible and can handle large scale analysis. I have recently built a pipeline to handle meta-analysis of RNA-seq data that incorporates variant calling steps, but further work is needed to validate this tool to assure accuracy and reproducibility of results. It can then be used to map the spatio-temporal variation of ADAR editing landscapes. The proposed project will study ADAR editing landscapes in the following ways: (i) new computational pipelines will be benchmarked to use variant calling with RNA-seq datasets using simulated reads, (ii) ADAR editing landscape diversity in the publicly available human samples will be mapped; the computational predictions and hypotheses generated from the pipeline will be validated using (iii) measuring calcium flux in cells with known differential ADAR editing landscapes caused by PolyI:C (viral infection mimic) treatment. The proposed work will yield a validated pipeline capable of mapping ADAR editing landscapes with machine learning algorithms. Defining ADAR editing landscapes is paramount to biomarker discovery and can influence precision medicine applications in diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. This project will allow for me to gain the knowledge base necessary to become an independent researcher with a unique skill set of both computational and benchwork methods to advance the field of neuroscience. Project Narrative Inferring ADAR editing landscapes and their link with ion homeostasis and excitatory signaling in the brain is important for understanding, diagnosing or staging neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder and suicide. This proposed project will develop and validate computational tools to use RNA-seq from publicly available datasets for ADAR editing inferences and to delineate patterns of editing changes in cells experiencing viral infections. Overall, this project will give me the training to build my unique skill set of both computational and experimental methods that will enable me as an independent researcher to bridge the gap between bioinformatics and experimental researchers and translate my findings into precision medicine.",ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders,10238770,F31MH123131,"['Accounting', 'Anxiety', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Fura-2', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'High-Throughput RNA Sequencing', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferon Activation', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Ions', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'PF4 Gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'adenosine deaminase', 'biomarker discovery', 'completed suicide', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'data visualization', 'detector', 'differential expression', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'dopaminergic differentiation', 'excitotoxicity', 'experience', 'immune activation', 'in silico', 'innate immune pathways', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood regulation', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel marker', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'release of sequestered calcium ion into cytoplasm', 'serotonin receptor', 'side effect', 'skills', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virtual machine']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,30346
"Identifying causal genetic variants and molecular mechanisms impacting mental health Identifying how genetic variation leads to neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders provides new means to study, predict, prevent and treat disease. Identifying the immediate molecular consequences of disease- associated genetic variation has necessitated the development of large-scale, multi-tissue functional genomic resources. Projects such as GTEx, Roadmap Epigenomics Project and PsychENCODE have combined molecular QTL mapping and epigenomic maps in bulk tissues to interpret various disease-associated genetic variants. However, few colocalizations between molecular QTLs and traits have been robustly identified and few causal variants mapped. As tissues like the brain constitute 100s of cell-types, we hypothesize that existing maps may mask the contributions of disease-associated variation in less-abundant cell types. One extremely powerful approach to identify cell-type specific molecular effects and their relationship to genetic diseases is through application of chromatin accessibility data – these data both allow inference of causal cell types and provide base level resolution gene regulation. Our team has considerable expertise in connecting GWAS to molecular functions and predicting causal variants through use of chromatin accessibility data. We have additionally recently collaborated to generate a comprehensive, multi-individual map single cell ATAC- seq map (scATAC-seq) of six different brain regions to detect causal cell types and predict causal variants. This work has been recently demonstrated in our fine-mapping study of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (Corces et al, bioRxiv, 2020) but has not been systematically applied to mental health disorders. We propose to develop statistical genetics and machine learning approaches that advance the use of scATAC-seq data to connecting mental health GWAS loci to specific cell types, mechanisms and causal variants. In Aim 1, we will assemble a pipeline that leverages region and cell type-specific scATAC-seq data to identify pathological cell types for 100s of mental health and brain-related traits. We will also enhance the detection of cell-type specific molecular mechanisms by extending and applying a novel GWAS/QTL colocalization approach. Throughout these activities, variants will be validated using massively-parallel reporter assays (MPRA). In Aim 2, we will develop sophisticated machine learning models that learn regulatory grammars and score variants across the allele frequency spectrum. Predicted causal variants in GWAS loci will be further assessed with MPRAs in Aim 1 and applied in Aim 3. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate how improved detection of causal variants using our single-cell informed models aids transferability of polygenic risk scores across populations.  We will provide open resources and reproducible computational methods and pipelines that integrate single cell chromatin accessibility data from multiple brain regions. This will allow detection cell-type specific genetic effects and pathological cell types in mental health GWAS, establish robust causal links between variants, genes and disease, and improve prediction of disease risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Identifying causal genetic variants in mental health disease is a major challenge limiting interpretation of disease biology, prediction of risk and development of therapies. Our work will develop computational approaches to identify these variants, interpret molecular disease mechanisms and predict individual risks.",Identifying causal genetic variants and molecular mechanisms impacting mental health,10116649,R01MH125244,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Mus', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'brain cell', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'computational pipelines', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open data', 'polygenic risk score', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'regression algorithm', 'risk prediction', 'success', 'therapy development', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,618007
"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,10085248,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'computational pipelines', 'data pipeline', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,563248
"Analysis of Poison Exon Inclusion in Genes Associated with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorder Project Summary/Abstract Over one in one hundred infants born are affected by neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which can cause a host of debilitating symptoms including early-onset seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Application of whole exome/genome sequencing to examine NDD has revealed many disease-causing variations, but in a substantial proportion of cases the genetic cause remains undetermined. The analysis of deep-intronic non-coding variants has provided diagnosis when coding variation cannot be implicated in disease. For example, intronic variants in the “20N” poison exon of SCN1A results in loss of function, causing Dravet Syndrome, an NDD causing prolonged seizures in the first year of life. Poison exons are a mechanism of gene regulation whereby a premature termination codon caused by inclusion of the poison exon induces nonsense- mediated decay of the mRNA transcript. Preliminary analysis has shown that poison exon inclusion (PEI) in SCN1A and SCN8A decreases during embryonic brain development, inversely proportional to total RNA expression. The brain is a hotbed of alternative splicing during early neuronal development therefore it is plausible, if not probable that novel poison exons remain uncharacterized. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that PEI is a mechanism to differentiallyregulate gene expression during earlyneuronal development, and intronic variants affecting PEI in genes of developmental importance contribute to disease phenotype. In Aim 1, the sodium and calcium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit families will be assessed to detect and characterize novel poison exons. Known and novel PEI will then be determined in the developing brain using publicly available RNA-seq experiments. In Aim 2 this analysis will be scaled up over 100-fold to detect and assess PEI in over 3000 genes associated with NDD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the developing brain and the driving forces of PEI evolution will be assessed. Comparative analysis of poison exons will be conducted using k-means hierarchical clustering and unsupervised random forest machine learning methodologies to determine prime biological factors driving PEI utilization. In Aim 3, intronic variants will be analyzed in probands of NDD and ASD in regions of known and hypothetical PEI and the affect these variants have on disease phenotype will be computationally assessed. These experiments will reveal new insights into alternative splicing in the developing brain and provide potential genetic explanation of currently unknown NDD disease phenotype. The research will be conducted at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, which allows developing scientists to hone skills in a dynamic, hands-on environment with supplemental training courses as necessary. Besides the research outlined in the proposal, training will include courses in conduct of responsible research, advanced biostatistics, machine learning, bioinformatics, and wet lab techniques next to personal development to improve oral and written communication and presentation skills as well as time management. Project Narrative Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs) are debilitating early-onset diseases estimated to affect 1-2% of the population, and the cause of a substantial proportion of these cases remains unknown. Our lab has recently implicated causative variants in poison exons, a cryptic alternatively spliced exon causing transcript degradation via nonsense-mediated decay. The proposed research aims to examine the role of poison exon inclusion in the regulation of genes associated with NDD during neurological development, providing insights into alternative splicing in the brain and provide essential information for diagnosis and potential therapeutics for patients with NDD.",Analysis of Poison Exon Inclusion in Genes Associated with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorder,10234717,F31MH126628,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Channel', 'Catalogs', 'Cations', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Exons', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Nonsense-Mediated Decay', 'Onset of illness', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Poison', 'Population', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Truncation', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'SCN8A gene', 'Scientist', 'Seizures', 'Sodium', 'Sodium Channel', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Terminator Codon', 'Tetrapoda', 'Therapeutic', 'Time Management', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'career development', 'causal variant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative genomics', 'disabling symptom', 'disease phenotype', 'dravet syndrome', 'driving force', 'early onset', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Precursor', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prevent', 'proband', 'random forest', 'responsible research conduct', 'scale up', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'voltage', 'voltage gated channel']",NIMH,HUDSON-ALPHA INSTITUTE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY,F31,2021,42792
"Fine-mapping psychiatric  disease variants that affect post-transcriptional gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD) such as schizophrenia (SZ), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and bipolar disorders (BD) are remarkably common, with SZ alone affecting nearly three million Americans. Despite more than fifty years of research, no cures exist for these conditions and the standard of treatment remains unsatisfactory. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) indicate that, in addition to highly penetrant rare mutations, NPD risk also reflects the impact of hundreds of common single nucleotide polymorphisms with small effect sizes. A major challenge in the field has been illuminating the pathways connecting these genetic variants (the vast majority of which fall in non-coding sequences) to target genes and causal cellular phenotypes. To understand how these myriad risk loci causally contribute to disease risk, it is essential to screen for putatively causal variant(s) and determine how they influence gene expression, which has been shown to be cell-type specific, as well as cellular function. Recent evidence has emerged indicating a substantial contribution of RNA splicing variation to heritability across many complex genetic diseases, including SZ. Based on our preliminary analyses and the work of others, we hypothesize that a substantial proportion of NPD GWAS loci exert their pathogenic effects on neuronal function by impacting RNA: its structure, modifications, protein interactions and splicing. To test this, we will apply novel tools and machine learning methods to predict and quantify RNA splicing in the largest SZ, ASD and BD GWAS, in order to predict splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs, Aim 1). To confirm true effects on exon inclusion independently in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons (i.e., the major cell-types impacted in NPD), up to several thousand of the predicted splice variants will be tested by a massively parallel reporter assay, MaPSy (Aim 2). Finally, in order to evaluate the cell-type-specific impact of putative causal sQTLs identified in Aims 1 and 2 on neuronal maturation and synaptic function, we will use CRISPR gene editing to engineer these mutations within human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models of both neural cell types (Aim 3). Our overarching goal is to map and functionally evaluate the NPD-GWAS loci that impact alternative splicing and neuronal function. Our work may impact the field by delivering new insights into the role of common variants in NPD pathophysiology, which could inform ways of improving diagnostics, predicting clinical trajectories, and developing novel therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The causal role of neuropsychiatric disease risk variants putatively involved in RNA splicing on neuronal function has not been fully explored. By combining genetic fine-mapping, machine learning methods, massively parallel reporter assays, CRISPR-genetic engineering, and human induced pluripotent stem cell models, we propose to discover neuropsychiatric risk alleles predicted to impact alternative splicing and empirically test their molecular and functional impact in neurons. By better understanding the role of common variants in disease risk, we hope to improve diagnostics, predict clinical trajectories and develop novel therapeutic interventions.",Fine-mapping psychiatric  disease variants that affect post-transcriptional gene regulation,10415485,R56MH127844,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'FURIN gene', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Introns', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spliced Genes', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mutant', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome prediction', 'overexpression', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'risk variant', 'standard care', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell model', 'synaptic function', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R56,2021,772112
"Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data Project Summary In the past fifteen years, great efforts have been made to understand the genetic architecture of complex human diseases through genome-wide association studies. Although many genome-wide significant variants have been identified, the heritability or variance explained by these variants remains very small, suggesting substantial missing heritability that may yet be explained by common genetic variants with smaller effect sizes and/or rare and low frequency variants, which calls for the development and application of novel statistical methods to whole genome/exome sequencing data collected from deeply phenotyped cohorts. In this project, we will develop methods that leverage multiple correlated endophenotypes and further integrate functional annotation data to identify novel rare variants for complex traits. We will develop a set of new computational and analytical tools that are practically useful and broadly applicable to general sequencing studies, and the applications of our methods will likely identity novel rare variant associations and shed new lights on the genetics of cardiometabolic diseases. In Aim 1, we propose to develop novel statistical methods to integrate multiple endophenotypes to study the impact of rare variants on complex human diseases. Our methods will fill in the gap between the current practice of association studies and the practical needs of integrating endophenotypes for improved understanding and diagnosis of clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will extend the methods to meta-analyses across studies. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel kernel machine learning approach to integrating various functional information to annotate the whole genome region, and further integrate them to develop a dynamic whole-genome scan test to detect rare variant associations with multiple endophenotypes. We will leverage the NHLBI TOPMed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and the UK Biobank whole exome sequencing (WES) data, and integrate the functional annotation data to identify and dissect the role of rare variants on the cardiometabolic traits (Aim 4). Our proposed work is cost-effective as it leverages the existing WGS/WES samples and functional annotation data while providing methods and tools that are broadly applicable to other studies, and builds on a strong team of scientists with proven track record in statistical genetics, large-scale genetic studies, and cardiometabolic traits. We expect our methods will lead to the discoveries of many more rare and low frequency variants for these traits. These results will offer new insights to help design more effective treatment and prevention strategies.

"Computational modeling of genetic variations by multi-omics integration to decipher personal genome Computational modeling of genetic variations by multi-omics integration to decipher personal genome A person’s genome typically contains millions of genetic variants. Understanding these variants by assessing their functional impact on a person’s phenotype, is currently of great interest in human genetics and precision medicine. Though Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) or Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) studies have successfully identified variants associated with traits or molecular phenotypes, most of them are in noncoding regions and hampered by linkage disequilibrium, making the identification and interpretation of casual variants difficult. Moreover, most of these discoveries are common variants, however, rare and individual-specific variants in personal genome are underexplored. Understanding these variants will not only explain the missing heritability from GWAS but also improve the precision medicine. Recently, the advent and popularity of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and paired multi-omics functional assays provide an unprecedented opportunity to identify rare and individual-specific casual variants. However, the sample sizes of most WGS studies are modest compared to GWAS, making the WGS analysis particularly challenging. Nevertheless, statistical and computational methods for analyzing WGS are underdeveloped. Given these challenges and my unique multi- disciplinary training, the overall goals of my research program are to develop a novel class of machine learning, statistical and system biology approaches for the identification, prioritization and interpretation of noncoding variants by integrating GWAS, WGS and multi-omics functional assays, which will empower precision medicine by identifying individualized biomarkers for disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Specifically, in the next five years, my lab will (i) develop a novel transfer learning approach to improve the prediction of noncoding casual variants using multi-dimensional omics features (ii) develop a multi-omics integrated omnibus scan test to improve the identification of rare casual variants from whole-genome sequencing data (iii) develop an integrative computational framework for scoring impact of noncoding variants in personal genome (iv) develop a novel class of multi-trait methods to improve phenotype prediction using whole-genome genetic variations. In the meantime, supported by Indiana University Precision Health Initiative, we will apply the methodologies to different studies from Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Center and Indiana Multiple Myeloma Biobank for novel scientific findings. We will work close with collaborated geneticists and clinician-scientists to interpret the discoveries. Importantly, we will work with experimental labs to validate the findings. In line with our previous work, we will continue to make all developed methods into open-source software tools that are accessible and useful to the biomedical research community.

"Genetic Prediction for Treatment Resistance in Kawasaki Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kawasaki Disease (KD) is a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity in children. Poor response to IVIG remains one of the critical determinants of coronary artery risk in KD. The inability to predict this response and the potential for developing persistent coronary artery aneurysms serves as a major impediment to progress and development of intensified therapy. Currently available data indicate that KD susceptibility and treatment response, as well as the propensity for coronary artery disease, depend on an individual patient's genetic background. Studies directed at identifying appropriate genetic biomarkers have been impaired by: 1) phenotyping lacking rigor, 2) use of genome wide association studies often employing chips or arrays for detection of common variants rather than low frequency or rare variants, 3) lack of clarity for the mechanisms of IVIG anti-inflammation in KD (necessary for guiding most pharmacogenomics studies) 4) focus on gene candidates, which are impractical for clinical testing, and 5) vague racial assignment methodology confounding pharmacogenomics. Furthermore, exome sequencing and analyses likely would miss potential important variants as IVIG anti-inflammatory mechanism includes transcriptional regulation at intergenic regions. We hypothesize that, by using improved and rigorous phenotyping techniques in combination with whole genome sequencing (WGS) and analyses, we will be able to identify select biomarkers for accurate prediction of KD treatment response and development of coronary aneurysms. The Pacific Northwest Kawasaki Disease Data-Biobank, established mainly through funding via PI Portman, R21HL090558, Thrasher Research Foundation; and PI, Shrestha, Southeastern AHA has accumulated DNA and clinical data from over 800 KD patients, eligible for pharmacogenomics analyses. We will leverage this wealth of DNA and clinical data along with recently updated AHA clinical KD criteria in order to identify rare and common variants, which determine IVIG treatment response. WGS will also allow a) identification of individual private SNPs (rare variants), b) identification of population-specific private SNPs, c) building a complete picture of genetic variations including structural variants (CNVs and insertion/deletions), d) gene- based analysis of both common and rare variants, and e) identification of actual functional SNPs as opposed to common imputed or SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD). Additionally, we will account for race, an important variant in KD, by rigorous racial assignment using ancestry information markers and principal component analyses. We will use rigorous methodology to achieve the following specific aims 1) Perform whole genome sequencing to identify genetic variations, which could serve as clinical biomarkers for IVIG resistance in KD patients. 2) Determine novel genomic variants associated with giant coronary artery aneurysms (GCA) among children with KD. 3) Prepare to assess if IVIG resistance is greater among African Americans and if this response depends on racial based differences in the frequency of genetic variations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kawasaki Disease (KD) is an inflammatory disease, which attacks the coronary arteries of young children.

"Collaborative Research to Explore Genetic Variation and Phenotypic Spectrum of Elastin and Related Genes Summary In the past, new diseases were delineated when clinicians brought together a cohort of individuals with similar phenotypic characteristics. They then performed genetic testing and looked for shared genetic changes among the affected cohort. While this method proved successful in some cases, discovery was limited to disorders with relatively few genes and highly distinctive presentation. Since the advent of exome sequencing, physicians have become increasingly aware of the wide spectrum of variability of clinical features associated with previously known genes, with the actual manifestations attributable to a genetic variation being far greater than what was previously anticipated--the proverbial, “iceberg effect.” Overcoming these challenges requires a new approach. Instead of starting with the defined phenotype, we propose starting at the gene and working our way forward to identify the full spectrum of phenotypes that can arise from these genetic variations. Such work requires high numbers of well-phenotyped and genotyped samples, as well as the expertise to appropriately evaluate patients of interest. This application brings together two institutions with the experience and capability to do just that. The Geisinger Health System maintains extensive medical records and genotype and sequence data on more than 141,000 participants enrolled in the MyCode Community Health Initiative and has the expertise to mine those records and genomic sequences for meaningful and medically relevant associations. The NIH has expertise in the deep phenotyping and discovery in rare disease. For proof of principle that this gene-first strategy works, we are beginning our analysis into elastic fiber mediated connective tissue disease, an area with which our NIH collaborators have significant expertise. Previous literature linked changes in elastic fiber genes to defects in aortic diameter and tortuosity, lung changes such as emphysema and skin changes including laxity with more recent work suggesting connections to more common phenotypes such as hypertension, intracranial aneurysm, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Our goal is to define all phenotypes, rare and common, associated with elastic fiber disease and to investigate the mechanism by which variation in these genes produces phenotypes in order to develop novel treatment strategies. In order to achieve this goal, we have developed two specific aims combining the strengths of Geisinger and the National Institutes of Health investigators. Aim 1. A) Screen an unselected population for variants in elastin and other elastic fiber genes and B) correlate with phenotypic features mined from the electronic health record. Aim 2: Identify previously unidentified phenotypes in patients with known and novel damaging variants in elastic fiber genes through deep phenotyping and disease modeling in vitro functional analysis. Collaboration between the two institution's diverse and multidisciplinary teams will increase understanding about the impact of elastic fiber disease and provide insight leading to treatment of human disease. Narrative: In the past, the medical community identified human diseases by combining patients with similar phenotypes and looking for shared genetic changes. This approach is limited by our clinical ability to see appropriate connections between phenotypic features in patients. This application uses a gene-first approach in a large research cohort with associated exome sequences to identify the full range of medically relevant human phenotypes (common and rare) associated with variants in genes coding for elastic fiber proteins followed by deep phenotyping in individual patients to learn more about the mechanism of disease and its clinical impact.",Collaborative Research to Explore Genetic Variation and Phenotypic Spectrum of Elastin and Related Genes,10129419,U01HL146188,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aneurysm', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'C-terminal', 'Caliber', 'Case Study', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Connective Tissue', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Cutis Laxa', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elastic Fiber', 'Elastic Tissue', 'Elastin', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Extramural Activities', 'FBLN5 gene', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Iceberg', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institution', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mutation', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Protein-Lysine 6-Oxidase', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Stretching', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arterial tortuosity', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical application', 'clinical center', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'electronic structure', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'fibulin-4', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'individual patient', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phenotypic data', 'population based', 'premature', 'profiles in patients', 'protein structure function', 'rare variant', 'success', 'text searching', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,GEISINGER CLINIC,U01,2021,600686
"Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX SUMMARY Deficiencies in coagulation factor IX (FIX) cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, while high levels of FIX pose a risk for thrombosis. Thus, genetic variation in the F9 gene encoding FIX can impact bleeding by decreasing FIX expression or activity, or can impact thrombosis by increasing FIX expression or activity. However, when a new DNA variant is discovered in the F9 gene, we typically lack the evidence needed to confidently determine if the variant alters the function of the encoded FIX protein and, if so, how severely. For example, in the national hemophilia genotyping project MyLifeOurFuture, the majority of F9 missense variants (i.e. DNA changes predicted to change a FIX amino acid) discovered in patients with hemophilia B had insufficient evidence to be classified as pathogenic. Functional studies, where a FIX variant’s stability, activity or other properties are evaluated in vitro, can provide strong evidence to inform interpretation of F9 variants. However, traditional functional studies are time- and resource-intensive, so testing the hundreds of F9 variant we have observed so far would be impractical. Evaluating the thousands of possible FIX missense variants we could observe as more individuals are sequenced would be impossible. Instead, we propose a new approach to express and characterize nearly every possible missense variant in the FIX protein to advance our understanding of FIX biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the F9 gene, and advance hemophilia care and treatments. To accomplish this goal, we will employ deep mutational scanning, a method we developed for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. Here, we will display a library of nearly all possible FIX missense variants tethered to the surface of cultured human cells. We propose to exploit this FIX surface display library in two aims: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on FIX expression and secretion, and 2) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on specific FIX functions including Gla-domain gamma-carboxylation and activation of FIX by factor XIa (FXIa). These aims will reveal how nearly all possible missense variants in FIX impact expression, secretion, gamma- carboxylation, and activation by FXIa. In aim 3, we will use these large-scale functional data to dissect the mechanism by which F9 pathogenic variants disrupt FIX function. We will also use machine learning, leveraging the functional data along with other features to predict pathogenicity for each missense variant in FIX. Taken together, the functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of F9 variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand FIX biology, improve the clinical translation of F9 genetic information, and inform new treatments. NARRATIVE DNA changes that affect the F9 gene that makes coagulation factor IX (FIX) can reduce FIX levels and cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, or increase the amount of active FIX and increase the risk of thrombosis. Although hundreds of variants have been detected in the F9 gene, there is often insufficient information to know how any one specific change will affect the protein, if that change will cause disease, or how severe disease will likely be. We will use new technologies to study the consequences of every possible amino acide change in FIX, with the goal of developing the information needed to understand the significance of new genetic changes as they are discovered in the future and to improve the care and treatment of patients.",Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX,10136082,R01HL152066,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Caring', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Coagulation Process', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'F9 gene', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor IX', 'Factor XIa', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Future', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hemophilia A', 'Hemophilia B', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic function', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'carboxylation', 'clinical translation', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'multiplex assay', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'tool']",NHLBI,BLOODWORKS,R01,2021,428767
"Deciphering the role of noncoding variation in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis Project Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the brain and spinal cord mediated largely by pathogenic T cell responses to myelin antigens, resulting in demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS). Myelin-reactive T cells are also crucial for induction of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Studies of MS and EAE implicate CD4 T helper (Th) cells in disease pathogenesis, including pro-inflammatory Th17 and Th1 cells. In this regard, the disease-promoting ability of these T cell subsets stems from both their capacity to target and infiltrate the CNS and their pro-inflammatory effector function. An interplay between genetic and environmental factors is implicated in the pathogenesis of MS. However, despite a wealth of genome wide association data (GWAS) data revealing a strong genetic contribution to MS, it has been challenging to identify the bona fide disease-promoting gene target(s) of many risk-associated variants, and the cellular compartment in which they contribute to dysregulation. In preliminary work, we have applied global genomics approaches to map MS-associated noncoding risk variants to their long-range target gene by physically capturing enhancer-promoter interactions. These MS-implicated genes were further prioritized based on dysregulated expression signatures in pathogenic Th17 cells derived from MS patients. Using this approach, we have identified putative regulatory MS variants and gene targets that control CD4 T cell function in MS that are the basis of this application. We hypothesize that identifying noncoding variants that alter the regulatory function of cis elements controlling proinflammatory T cells will provide novel mechanistic insights into the underlying etiology governing the development of MS. Here, we propose an integrative strategy to prioritize and validate causal genetic variants in MS pathogenesis. The goal of Aim 1 is to determine the contribution of noncoding risk variants to CD4 T cell gene regulation. In particular, we will employ a combination of high-throughput regulatory reporter assays and machine learning approaches to identify SNPs with regulatory function in primary human CD4 T cells. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism by which these regulatory variants contribute to altered T cell function and pathogenicity in MS. Complementary CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic and epigenetic perturbations will define the enhancer context of risk alleles and delineate bona fide regulatory gene targets of regulatory risk variants. Moving from genotype to phenotype, we will define true causal variants that contribute to disease etiology in the context of an intact immune system using genetic interventions that model conserved risk variants in mice. Together, the proposed experiments will advance our understanding of the both the genetic and cellular mechanisms governing Th17 cell pathogenicity in MS and discover new loci with unknown functions in disease etiology. Relevance Statement Recent years have witnessed an explosion of information derived from genome wide association studies (GWAS) linking genetic variation with increased risk for diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). To date, little mechanistic insight has been gleaned from the majority of risk-associated variants, a challenge reflecting their primary localization to non-coding regulatory regions of the genome. The proposed work will capitalize on emerging genomics approaches to prioritize lineage-relevant MS risk variants, determine their mechanism of action in contributing to the pathogenesis of MS, and as such, provide new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting MS.",Deciphering the role of noncoding variation in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis,10298904,R01AI156186,"['Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis', 'Explosion', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunologist', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Myelin', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurology', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Technology', 'Th1 Cells', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'causal variant', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome editing', 'experimental study', 'gene therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'stem', 'transcription factor']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,623436
"High-throughput computational modeling to assess the role of 3D genome folding in human congenital anomalies PROJECT SUMMARY Congenital heart defects (CHD) occur in nearly one percent of live births each year and are the leading cause of defect-associated infant mortality. The majority of genetic studies in CHD have focused on variation within the protein-coding exome; however, most disease-risk loci fall in noncoding regions, and it is presumed that some of these represent important regulators of gene expression such as cis-acting enhancers and insulators. In spite of these studies, less than half of the heritability of CHD has been explained via genome-wide associations or burden testing of protein-coding genes and putative regulatory elements. In this proposal, we hypothesize that genetic variants that alter 3D genome folding contribute to the etiology of CHD by disrupting the contacts of key cis-regulatory mechanisms in development. One type of chromatin structure that could be affected is the Topologically Associating Domain (TAD), which refers to a level of chromatin organization characterized by higher contact frequency within the domain relative to loci outside of that domain. It has been shown that while unaffected controls show a clear depletion of SVs at TAD boundary regions across the genome, individuals diagnosed with Developmental Delay (DD) and autism showed no bias in the genomic location of SVs. Based on these findings and the high rates of co-morbidity between DD and CHD, the first aim characterizes structural variation at TAD boundaries and other non-coding regulatory regions in CHD relative to controls, and will further determine whether TADs are enriched for SVs in a region-specific manner based on proximity to genes active in the developing heart. In the second aim, we use a complementary annotation- agnostic deep learning approach developed in our group to predict chromatin contact changes as a result of genetic variants in CHD patients. We will use Hi-C sequencing to confirm the model-predicted chromatin contact effects in iPSC-derived endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and additionally use RNA sequencing to determine whether the hypothesized transcriptional disruption occurred. Finally, in the third aim we will create a model that uses genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional features of genetic variants found in each individual to predict their phenotypic status. By analyzing the relative importance of features used to make predictions, we will be able to determine what types of biological mechanisms and pathways are most predictive for congenital heart anomalies. Collectively, these findings will elucidate a currently underappreciated source of regulatory disruption in human development, identify new disease-relevant genes and potential therapeutic targets, and will refine and validate a method for the high-throughput prediction of chromatin contact frequency to advance the field of 3D genomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE As the leading cause of defect-associated infant mortality, congenital heart defects have been studied extensively to better understand their underlying genetic mechanisms. However, previous approaches have focused on direct mutations to protein-coding elements and were not sufficient to explain the full heritability of this disease. Our proposal posits that an underappreciated disease mechanism is transcriptional misregulation during development caused by variants that disrupt 3D genome organization, and we therefore aim to characterize the extent to which this occurs in human heart defects and validate specific examples.",High-throughput computational modeling to assess the role of 3D genome folding in human congenital anomalies,10138298,F31HL156439,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'ChIP-seq', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fetal Heart', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heritability', 'Hi-C', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Live Birth', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Trees', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'comorbidity', 'congenital anomaly', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'exome', 'falls', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'malformation', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F31,2021,37830
"Using Multi-Spectral Imaging with Microchip Electrophoresis to Accurately Screen Newborns for Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Hemoglobin (Hb) disorders are among the world's most common monogenic diseases. Nearly 7% of the world’s population carry Hb gene variants. Sickle cell disease (SCD) arises when Hb mutations are inherited homozygously (HbSS) or paired with another β-globin gene mutation. Globally, an estimated 400,000 babies are born annually with SCD, and 70%-75% are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is estimated that 50-90% in SSA die by their 5th birthday, 70% of these deaths are preventable. Effective management of SCD involves early diagnosis, and genetic counselling, and, importantly, nationwide newborn screening (NBS). NBS programs utilizing centralized laboratories have dramatically reduced SCD mortality in high-resource countries. NBS requires sensitive detection of relatively low levels of Hb variants in the presence of high fetal Hb (HbF). Normal HbA and sickle HbS should be accurately identified in the presence of high levels (up to 90%) of HbF. The current gold standard for Hb variant testing is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which requires expensive equipment and reagents, highly trained personnel, and modern laboratories. In low- resource regions, very few centralized laboratories can perform costly Hb testing. Testing is not available to the large percentage of infants born outside of a major hospital or city. There is an unmet need for affordable, portable, easy-to-use, accurate, point-of-care (POC) tests to facilitate decentralized Hb testing to enable nationwide NBS programs. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed Hb electrophoresis as an essential in vitro diagnostic in low- and middle-income countries. We have developed a POC microchip electrophoresis Hb variant testing system, MicroChip Electrophoresis (MCE), under the product name “Gazelle Hb Variant” by Hemex Health, Inc. MCE reports Hb phenotype, Hb quantification (%Hb), and an interpretive statement showing genotype (such as SCD, Sickle Cell Trait, or Normal). MCE has been extensively validated for hemoglobinopathies, including SCD, hemoglobin E disease, and thalassemia. Newborns and infants below 6 weeks of age have very low concentrations of Hb variants other than Hb F which is high, therefore an improvement to lower the limit of detection (LoD) is needed to support NBS programs worldwide. By decreasing the LoD from the current 10% to 2%, newborns and infants can be screened with this affordable system. The innovation in this SBIR Phase I is the integration of multi-spectral imaging and machine learning based data analysis capability to MCE to develop MCE+ to accurately screen newborns for common Hb variants. We propose the following aims: Aim 1: Integrate multi-spectral imaging and machine learning algorithm into the MCE platform to enable identification and quantification of hemoglobin variants in newborns. Aim 2: Perform clinical testing of the MCE+ multi-spectral newborn screening system. Significance of this project is that MCE+ is the only affordable POC system for quantitative and objective hemoglobin variant testing that allows screening at birth. PROJECT NARRATIVE Up to 50 to 90% of children born with sickle cell disease (SCD) in economically disadvantaged countries (over 400,000 per year) die before the age of five, although the WHO estimates that 70% could be saved through simple, cost-effective treatments. Early diagnosis starting at birth is critical for implementing effective disease management, but newborn screening is a challenge for low resource environments where a decentralized, point-of-care solution is needed. This project enables our affordable, point-of-care platform based on microchip electrophoresis technology to accurately perform newborn screening.",Using Multi-Spectral Imaging with Microchip Electrophoresis to Accurately Screen Newborns for Sickle Cell Disease,10255480,R43HL156685,"['Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Age', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Country', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Electrophoresis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Fetal Hemoglobin', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genotype', 'Ghana', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin E Disease', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'India', 'Infant', 'Inherited', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Microchip Electrophoresis', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Point of Care Technology', 'Point-of-Care Systems', 'Population', 'Race', 'Reagent', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Cell Trait', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Southeastern Asia', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'beta Globin', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective treatment', 'detection limit', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'point of care testing', 'portability', 'preventable death', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sickling', 'spectrograph', 'trait']",NHLBI,"HEMEX HEALTH, INC.",R43,2021,256580
"Genome-wide association study of coronary artery disease in individuals of African ancestry PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death among adults in the United States. Its prevalence is highest in individuals of African ancestry. It has been estimated that genetic factors account for 26% to 69% of interindividual variation in CAD risk. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of CAD have mainly been conducted in populations of European and East-Asian ancestries and identified 207 independent loci so far. Few of the identified loci have been replicated in populations of African ancestries. Large-scale genetic study of CAD in African-ancestry populations are lacking. This proposal will efficiently leverage the existing resources of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology Consortium, Million Veteran Program and other established cohorts to create the largest-ever sample size for a genetic study of African-ancestry populations comprehensively phenotyped for CAD and related cardiometabolic traits. We propose to address the following Specific Aims. Aim 1 will interrogate the genome using admixture mapping, univariate GWAS, multi-variate GWAS and trans-ethnic GWAS approaches to identify loci associated with CAD in African-ancestry populations. Aim 2 will use phenome-wide association studies, variant-trait hierarchical clustering and integrative genomic analyses to characterize CAD loci and gain insights into phenotypic, physiologic, and mechanistic impacts that underlie the pathophysiology of CAD. Aim 3 will explore the public health impact and clinical relevance of CAD risk variants by constructing polygenic CAD risk scores and identifying pathogenic variants in Mendelian syndromes of CAD genes that are relevant to African-ancestry populations. The construction of population- specific polygenic risk scores and identification of rare and low-frequency pathogenic variants of large effect in Mendelian syndromes of CAD genes will facilitate quantification of CAD risk in individuals of African ancestry and potentially narrow the translational gap towards clinical use of genetic information across diverse populations. The comprehensive cross-trait associations of identified CAD risk loci will facilitate the discovery of subtypes of CAD. Both improved genetic CAD risk classifications and refined CAD sub-phenotyping would help with the implementation of precision medicine in CAD. The new biological insights elucidated from novel loci identified in African-ancestry populations may also be generalized to other populations for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of CAD. Project Narrative: This study aims to identify and characterize genetic loci underlying coronary artery disease in populations of African ancestry. We will efficiently leverage the existing resources of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology Consortium, Million Veteran Program and other established cohorts to create the largest-ever sample size for a study of an African-ancestry population comprehensively phenotyped for CAD and related cardiometabolic traits. The outcome of this study will provide a better understanding of the genetics of CAD and its risk factors in this high-risk population and has a strong likelihood of leading to measures that can help with the control and prevention of CAD in populations of African ancestry.",Genome-wide association study of coronary artery disease in individuals of African ancestry,10278230,R01HL158884,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Adult', 'African', 'African American', 'Architecture', 'Asians', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cause of Death', 'Chromatin', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Fasting', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Joints', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'admixture mapping', 'biobank', 'blood lipid', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease disparity', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic epidemiology', 'genomic locus', 'high risk population', 'implementation facilitation', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'risk sharing', 'risk variant', 'trait']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,832106
"Integrative genomic and epigenomic analysis of cancer using long read sequencing PROJECT SUMMARY The last twenty years have experienced extensive growth in the sequencing of cancer genomes, leading to a dramatically increased understanding of the role of genetic and epigenetic mutations in cancer. This has largely been enabled by developments in high-throughput “second-generation” sequencing technology and analysis that characterize cancer genomes using short-reads. Recently, a new generation of high-throughput long-read sequencing instruments, primarily from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore, have become available that are poised to displace short-read sequencing for many applications. We and others have used these technologies to discover tens of thousands of variants per cancer genome that are not detectable using short-reads, including structural variants and differentially methylated regions in known oncogenes and cancer risk genes. These technologies carry the potential to address many open questions in cancer biology, however, the analysis of long-read sequencing data is computationally demanding and needs specialized algorithms that are either too inefficient to use at scale or do not yet exist. In this proposal, we will address several gaps in the application of long-read technology for basic research and clinical use in cancer genomics. First, we will develop improved methods for finding structural variants and complex repeat expansions from long-reads, both of which are major diagnostic and prognostic indicators of disease, yet are not accurately identified using existing methods. Leveraging the improved phasing capabilities of long reads, this work will include the detection of mosaic variants, revealing tumor heterogeneity and variants in precancerous tissues. Next, we will apply machine learning and systems level advances to accelerate and improve the comparison of variants across large patient cohorts. Critically, this will compensate for the error prone nature of single molecule long-read sequencing to make these comparisons more accurate when comparing tumor-normal samples or pedigrees of related patients so that recurrent driving mutations can be accurately identified. Finally, we will develop integrative methods for the joint analysis of genome, transcriptome, and epigenetic profiling of cancer genomes. These advances will improve the identification of fusion genes, and allow for entirely new forms of epigenetic analysis, such as the allele-specific analysis of methylation across transposable elements and other repetitive elements. Synthesizing the many thousands of novel variants we will detect using our methods, we will then develop algorithms that will identify and evaluate recurrent genetic or epigenetic variations as putative driving mutations. All methods will be released open-source and will empower us, our ITCR collaborators, and the cancer genomics community at large to study genetic and epigenetic variants with near perfect accuracy and thereby unlock many new associations to treatment and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Emerging long-read single molecule sequencing platforms are poised to establish a new level of quality and resolution in cancer genome sequencing. Here we will develop and enhance algorithms for several important tasks in genomics with long reads, including improved genetic variation detection, transcriptional profiling, and methylation analysis. We will then work with our collaborators and other researchers to deploy these methods to develop a more complete understanding of cancer progression.",Integrative genomic and epigenomic analysis of cancer using long read sequencing,10187808,U01CA253481,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancerous', 'Cataloging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Karyotype', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Minisatellite Repeats', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Recurrence', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'driver mutation', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'fusion gene', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'methylome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'power analysis', 'premalignant', 'risk variant', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,383463
"Identifying new drivers of ovarian cancer from the non-coding genome by converging germline risk variants and somatic mutations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed research training program is to provide tailored additional training to facilitate successful career development throughout the completion of postdoctoral fellowship and the transition to independent tenure track professor. The key elements of this plan are: Candidate: I have considerable research experience in developing and applying computational models to understand complex biological systems. The training component of this proposal will focus on acquisition of knowledge in cancer genetics and genomics, integrative computational methodologies, and next-generation sequencing technologies. Additionally, I will receive training in laboratory management, networking and collaborations, and grant submissions. This well-rounded training plan will accelerate my goals of being an independent researcher and developing computational models to better understand cancer biology. Environment: The training environment at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center fosters productivity and collaboration with world class researchers in clinical and basic biomedical science. I have assembled an advisory committee with esteemed experts in the areas of epigenomics, genetics, data science and cancer biology to ensure my success in this training program and to guide me through the successful acquisition of a tenure track faculty position. These include my mentor Dr. Simon Gayther and four advisors, Dr. Benjamin Berman and Dr. Shelly Lu from Cedars-Sinai, and Dr. Bogdan Pasaniuc, and Dr. Paul Boutros from University of California, Los Angeles. Research: A fundamental goal of human genetics is to decipher the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Cancer is a disease comprising a heritable component that confers cancer predisposition and an acquired (somatic) component where accumulation of genetic alterations occurs during disease development. Population based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses have identified thousands of germline risk variants and somatic non-coding mutations involved in ovarian cancer development. Often, protein-coding cancer driver genes harbor both deleterious germline risk variants and somatic mutations. This proposal hypothesizes that the same is true for non-coding cancer drivers. With the wealth of epigenomics and regulatory datasets, the goal is to identify genomic regions where there are interactions between germline and somatic variants. The specific aims are: (1) identify functional regulatory elements where non-coding germline and somatic ovarian cancer variants co-localize; (2) identify non-coding ovarian cancer drivers through multi-omics regulatory evidence by machine learning models. The proposed studies will establish systematic and quantitative models to identify ovarian cancer non-coding drivers and improve our understanding of disease etiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ovarian cancer is responsible for more than 150,000 deaths per year and so it remains a high priority to develop effective prevention approaches and to identify new disease specific therapies to reduce disease mortality. The research proposed here has two components: (1) To characterize the genetic component in ovarian cancer development through epigenomic landscape; (2) to establish the functional relevance of genetic findings for clinical translation. This is a highly integrated multi-disciplinary research proposal, and these approaches to novel discovery and mechanistic understanding are desperately needed to advance our basic knowledge of this disease to develop clinical interventions that reduce mortality.",Identifying new drivers of ovarian cancer from the non-coding genome by converging germline risk variants and somatic mutations,10115485,K99CA256519,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Area', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Buffers', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epithelial ovarian cancer', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Human Genetics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Ovarian', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention approach', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prognosis', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer predisposition', 'cancer type', 'career development', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'ovarian neoplasm', 'population based', 'precursor cell', 'professor', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'success', 'tenure track', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'whole genome']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2021,173048
"Multi-ethnic high-throughput study to identify novel non-HLA genetic contributors to mortality after blood and marrow transplantation Project Summary Blood and marrow transplant (BMT) is an effective cure for many life-threatening hematologic diseases. Survival after BMT has improved dramatically over the past two decades, however up to 40% of patients still die within one year after HLA-matched unrelated donor allogeneic BMT. This project will build upon our prior genome-wide (GWAS) and exome-wide association studies (ExWAS) involving ~2,900 patients named Determining the Influence of Susceptibility COnveying Variants Related to one-Year mortality after BMT (DISCOVeRY-BMT). Our GWAS identified several donor loci that significantly increased recipient’s risk of disease-related mortality (DRM) and donor-recipient genotype mismatches significantly increased risk of transplant-related mortality (TRM) in European Americans (EAs). Our ExWAS discovered a rare nonsynonymous coding variant, where a donor-recipient genotype mismatch correlated with TRM and additional novel genes (e.g. TEX38, OR51D1, and NT5E) correlated with overall survival, TRM and DRM. Our goal for this proposal is two-fold: to deepen our understanding of non-HLA genetic contributors to BMT mortality, and to build the clinical-genomic prognostic models to translate such understanding into clinical practice. The first goal will be fulfilled in two directions. 1) We will systematically survey both rare and common variants using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and meta- GWAS in EAs as well as under-studied diverse populations in an effort to bridge the BMT survival disparity between EAs, African Americans, Asians and Hispanics. Our prior ExWAS in EAs demonstrated the important roles played by rare coding variants in BMT mortality, however, only 2% of rare variants are in the exome array. Therefore, we will use WES to assay all exonic variants in 5,598 multi-ethnic donor-recipient pairs. As the variants/genes we identify are direct candidates for causality, functional validation will be performed to investigate such relationships. In parallel, we will perform the largest meta-GWAS of BMT mortality to date. Through our collaborations, we have assembled all BMT GWAS data available in the US (8,576 donor-recipient pairs including 1,978 minority pairs). 2) We will interrogate WES and GWAS data to further reveal the biological networks contributing to BMT mortality. To meet the second goal, we will leverage our unique and powerful GWAS resource to develop prognostic models to predict patients’ personalized mortality risk. This is the first study to use next-generation sequencing technology to analyze the contribution of non-HLA coding variants on post-BMT mortality. GWAS data on 8,576 donor-recipient pairs, of which 5,598 pairs also have WES data, will make this the largest genetic study ever undertaken, and provide a real opportunity to understand the genetics of BMT mortality across diverse populations. The prognostic models we develop will provide a valuable tool to help reduce BMT mortality and enhance donor-recipient matching in routine clinical practice. Importantly, the data generated by this project will be shared publicly to serve as a resource for additional research to improve survivorship after BMT and enhance the public investment in this project. Project Narrative This is the first study to use both next-generation sequencing and genome-wide association study data to analyze the contribution of non-HLA genetic variants to mortality after allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) for life-threatening hematologic cancers. Importantly, our study population includes multiple races and ethnicities which will allow us to investigate the role of genetics on BMT survival across diverse populations. The data generated by this project will be shared publicly to serve as a resource for additional research to improve survivorship after this therapy and enhance the public investment in this project.",Multi-ethnic high-throughput study to identify novel non-HLA genetic contributors to mortality after blood and marrow transplantation,10276985,R01CA262899,"['10q21', '14q32', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Antigens', 'Asians', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Donor person', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hispanics', 'Immune response', 'Investments', 'Life', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Names', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in silico', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-ethnic', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'polygenic risk score', 'prognostic model', 'rare variant', 'study population', 'survival disparity', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'vaccine response']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R01,2021,954265
