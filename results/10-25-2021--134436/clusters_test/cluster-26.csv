"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,10171878,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'hematopoietic differentiation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,513500
"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH, PROJECT NARRATIVE The regulation of gene expression controls the determination of cell types, and aberrant gene expression can cause diseases such as cancer. RegulomeDB will enable researchers, clinicians, and sophisticated computer programs to relate DNA variants that lie in previously poorly understood regions of the human genome to possible functions thereby helping us understand the genetic basis of human variation and disease.",RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome,10245271,U24HG009293,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Quality Control', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cell determination', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'computer program', 'data integration', 'data wrangling', 'de novo mutation', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome annotation', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'meetings', 'outreach', 'random forest', 'social media', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'web platform', 'web site', 'web-accessible', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,674483
"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,10085663,R01HG009309,"['Archives', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase I', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,387500
"Systematic Identification of Core Regulatory Circuitry from ENCODE Data While much progress has been made generating high quality chromatin state and accessibility data from the ENCODE and Roadmap consortia, accurately identifying cell-type specific enhancers from these data remains a significant challenge. We have recently developed a computational approach (gkmSVM) to predict regulatory elements from DNA sequence, and we have shown that when gkmSVM is trained on DHS data from each of the human and mouse ENCODE and Roadmap cells and tissues, it can predict both cell specific enhancer activity and the impact of regulatory variants (deltaSVM) with greater precision than alternative approaches. The gkmSVM model encapsulates a set of cell-type specific weights describing the regulatory binding site vocabulary controlling chromatin accessibility in each cell type. A striking observation is that the significant gkmSVM weights are generally identifiable with a small (~20) set of TF binding sites which vary by cell-type, consistent with the hypothesis that cell-type specific expression programs are controlled by a small set of core factors tightly coupled in mutually interacting regulatory circuits. Perturbations of these core regulators enable transitions between stable differentiated cell-type states of this genetic circuit. Here, we will use gkmSVM to systematically identify the core regulatory circuitry in all existing ENCODE and Roadmap human and mouse cell lines and tissues, and produce DNA sequence based genomic regulatory maps and fine-scale predictions of core regulator binding sites within predicted regulatory regions. We will generate binding site models for core regulators in each cell type, assess the accuracy of our predictions through direct experimental validation. The value of this map critically depends on its accuracy, so we demonstrate that gkmSVM predictions consistently outperform alternative methods in massively parallel enhancer reporter and luciferase validation assays, in blind community assessments of regulatory element predictions (CAGI), and in predicting validated causal disease associated variants. In contrast, we show that methods using PWM descriptions of TF binding sites are significantly less accurate. We will produce base-pair resolution predictions of the cell specific TF binding sites (TFBS) within broader regulatory regions detected by multiple ENCODE epigenomic Mapping datasets, and to test these TFBS predictions in collaboration with Functional Characterization Centers (FCC). Our regulatory maps will help design and inform focused experiments probing regulatory mechanisms, and aid in the interpretation of disease associated non-coding variants. We propose to develop computational tools to systematically identify the core TF regulators using DNA sequence based machine learning (ML) in all existing ENCODE and Roadmap human and mouse cell lines and tissues, and to produce base-pair resolution predictions of the cell specific TF binding sites (TFBS) within broader regulatory regions detected by multiple ENCODE epigenomic Mapping datasets, and to test these TFBS predictions in collaboration with Functional Characterization Centers (FCC).",Systematic Identification of Core Regulatory Circuitry from ENCODE Data,10238262,U01HG009380,"['Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Enhancers', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mouse Cell Line', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'blind', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'programs']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,572256
"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D This section has not changed since the submission of the parent U01 grant. Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. This section has not changed since the submission of the parent U01 grant. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",10241049,U01HG009395,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedias', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guide RNA', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Ploidies', 'Published Comment', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'sequence learning', 'supervised learning', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2021,742538
"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non-coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well-described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome-wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE’s utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 100,000 CREs and 375,000 variants, representing ~100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element’s regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 20 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,10241056,UM1HG009435,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'trait']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2021,1496338
"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is to catalog all functional elements in the human genome through the integration and analysis of high-throughput data. We propose to continue the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, DAC) which will provide support and leadership in analyzing and integrating data from the ENCODE project as well as work closely with other ENCODE groups including the Data Coordination Center.

These investigators also have a history of successfully working collaboratively in large consortia, particularly with other ENCODE groups. Their publication records demonstrate their synergistic approach to producing high-impact science and useful resources that benefit the broader biomedical communities.

"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages.

"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,10208923,R01HG010045,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'comparative', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genomic locus', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'markov model', 'multi-task learning', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'novel', 'promoter', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,332892
"Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution Abstract The nematode C. elegans is unique among model organisms in having a defined lineage and known connections for all its 302 neurons. The genome sequence was completed more than 20 years ago, but knowing which genes in the genome are used in exactly which cells and what transcription factors are controlling that expression remains a major challenge. We have successfully applied single cell- (sc-)RNA-seq methods to one larval stage and three embryonic stages to measure the RNA content of individual cells across the whole animal. We also have preliminary data that indicates that we can assay chromatin accessibility at the single cell level using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). We now propose to collect both sc-RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data at multiple stages to determine the gene expression patterns of each cell in the worm and the active regulatory sequence throughout the entire life cycle of C. elegans. In turn we will use the combined data sets along with chromatin- immunoprecipitation- (ChIP-) seq data to impute what transcription factors are controlling expression of each gene in the genome in every cell and what regulatory sequences these transcription factors recognize. The results will provide a valuable resource to scientists studying the worm and addresses a major outstanding question in the molecular biology of development. In addition, these data sets, from an animal with a “ground truth” should serve as a platform for methods development in the single cell field. Narrative The nematode C. elegans is a simple animal that as an adult has just 959 somatic cells that arise from a known and constant lineage. We propose to use single cell methods to measure in every cell the expression of each gene and the active regulatory regions throughout the life cycle. Using these data and others, we will impute how these regulatory regions and the transcription factors that bind to them control gene expression in each cell.",Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution,10149376,R01HG010478,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dissociation', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Larva', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Tissues', 'Transposase', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'cost effectiveness', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'male', 'method development', 'muscular system', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcription factor', 'young adult']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,510309
"Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data Project Summary Understanding how genes' activities are controlled is crucial for elucidating the basic operating rules of biology and molecular mechanisms of diseases. Recent innovations in single-cell genomic technologies have opened the door to analyzing a variety of functional genomic features in individual cells. These technologies enable scientists to systematically discover unknown cell subpopulations in complex tissue and disease samples, and allow them to reconstruct a sample's gene regulatory landscape at an unprecedented cellular resolution. Despite these promising developments, many challenges still exist and must be overcome before one can fully decode gene regulation at the single-cell resolution. In particular, current technologies lack the ability to accurately measure the activity of each individual cis-regulatory element (CRE) in a single cell. They also cannot measure all functional genomic data types in the same cell. Moreover, the prevalent technical biases and noises in single-cell genomic data make computational analysis non-trivial. With rapid growth of data, lack of computational tools for data analysis has become a rate-limiting factor for effective applications of single-cell genomic technologies.  The objective of this proposal is to develop computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory landscape using single-cell genomic data. Our Aim 1 addresses the challenge of accurately measuring CRE activities in single cells using single-cell regulome data. Regulome, deﬁned as the activities of all cis-regulatory elements in a genome, contains crucial information for understanding gene regulation. The state-of-the-art technologies for mapping regulome in a single cell produce sparse data that cannot accurately measure activities of individual CREs. We will develop a new computational framework to allow more accurate analysis of individual CREs' activities in single cells using sparse data. Our Aim 2 addresses the challenge of collecting multiple functional genomic data types in the same cell. We will develop a method that uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the most widely used single-cell functional genomic technology, to predict cells' regulatory landscape. Since most scRNA-seq datasets do not have accompanying single-cell data for other -omics data types, our method will also signiﬁcantly expand the utility and increase the value of scRNA- seq experiments. Our Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating different data types generated by different single-cell genomic technologies from different cells. We will develop a method to align single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell regulome data to generate an integrated map of transcriptome and regulome.  Upon completion of this proposal, we will deliver our methods through open-source software tools. These tools will be widely useful for analyzing and integrating single-cell regulome and transcriptome data. By addressing several major challenges in single-cell genomics, our new methods and tools will help unleash the full potential of single-cell genomic technologies for studying gene regulation. As such, they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases. Project Narrative Understanding how genes' activities are controlled at single-cell resolution is crucial for studying human diseases. This proposal will develop a coordinated set of computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory programs using single-cell genomic data. These methods and tools will allow scientists to more accurately and comprehensively reconstruct gene regulatory landscape of individual cells in complex tissue and disease samples, and they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases.",Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data,10205134,R01HG010889,"['Address', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stem Cell Development', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transposase', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'multiple data types', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,409375
"Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome Abstract After the completion of the Human Genome Project, thousands of experiments from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have successfully proﬁled regulatory elements and epigenetic landscape along the genome. More recently, over 2,000 chromatin organization datasets have been generated from 4D Nucleome (4DN) Project, and they provide complementary information about how these genomic and epigenomic elements are spatially organized in a nucleus. Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization with previously proﬁled 1D epigenome in different cell types will be a key step to understand the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation over long genomic distances. However, there are two challenges. First, there is a resolution mismatch between chromatin organization data (e.g. Hi-C contacts) which are usually measured at 10k base pair resolution, and epigenome-based chromatin state features (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) whose signals are usually at tens to hundreds of base pairs. Second, existing computational approaches for analyzing epigenome, such as annotating genome and understanding regulatory elements, all treat the DNA sequence as one-dimensional data, leaving the important 3D structural information unutilized. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches for understanding the relationship between chromatin state features and chromatin organization, performing 3D and 4D genome annotation, and identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors, respectively. After the completion of the proposed work, we expect to have: (1) an accurate and interpretable computational model to predict chromatin contact maps at nucleosome resolution for a wide range of cell lines, (2) 3D and 4D genome annotations over dynamic chromatin organization, regulatory elements and epigenomic features, and (3) a computational method for identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors which can help us understand the orchestration of noncoding genetic variants. These results will provide fundamental understanding of disease-relevant genetic variation in the light of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to jointly analyze 3D chromatin organization data and 1D epigenomic features, and reveal the interplay among regulatory elements, epigenomic features, and dynamic chromatin organization. These new methods will help us understand the mechanisms of the genetic variants identiﬁed in genome-wide association studies, and understand the genetic basis of many human diseases.",Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome,10251159,R35HG011279,"['3-Dimensional', 'Base Pairing', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hi-C', 'Human Genome Project', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleosomes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'novel', 'three dimensional structure', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2021,439299
"Causal Effect Estimation of Regulatory Molecules Project Summary/Abstract Transcription factors and microRNAs are essential regulatory molecules (RM) that control messenger RNAs (mRNA) and are known to be dysregulated in human diseases. Each RM may affect multiple pathways of the cell which is both a blessing and a curse. If a therapy targets the proper RM, it can attack the disease from multiple fronts and increase efficacy. On the other hand, targeted therapy may result in serious adverse effects due to our limited knowledge of the downstream causal effect of RM manipulation. Although the local bindings between single RMs and their targets have been studied computationally and experimentally, the intensity of functional consequences of such bindings on the transcriptome is unclear. Here, I propose statistical machine learning techniques and causal inference methods to predict the observed variability of gene expression using only regulatory molecules and estimate their downstream causal effect on the entire transcriptome. To achieve this goal, I start in Aim 1 by building a multi-response predictive model to predict the whole transcriptome using only RMs. This goal is challenging because the dimension of the response vector is more than the number of samples and I will use techniques from high-dimensional statistics to address this issue. In Aim 2, I will go beyond predictive modeling by estimating the causal effect of RMs on the transcriptome using invariant causal prediction. I will leverage the rapidly growing literature which connects causal inference to invariant prediction accuracy across heterogeneous data sources to infer the causal effect of RMs on mRNA. Having developed both predictive and causal models of RMs contribution to gene regulation, in Aim 3 during the R00 phase, I will focus on the most recent advances in double/debiased machine learning which allows the use of scalable machine learning methods for reliable estimation of causal effect of RMs on transcription. My proposed research will bring the most advanced statistical machine learning and causal inference techniques to genomics research and help design more effective targeted therapies by providing insights into the global role of RMs in gene expression regulation. During the training phase of the award, with the support of my outstanding mentoring team and scientific advisory committee, I will gain expertise in molecular biology and genomics while perfecting my knowledge of causal inference and machine learning. The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – James Hospital and the Mathematical Biosciences Institute will provide me with the ideal interdisciplinary environment to bridge data science and genomics and will help me achieve my career development goals and transition to a tenure-track faculty position. Project Narrative Targeting regulatory elements has the advantage of concurrently attacking multiple damaged pathways, with the possible pitfall of toxicity due to adverse unintended effects. Understanding the functional global impact of therapy on the entire transcriptome will guide us in designing drugs with higher efficacy and lower toxicity.

"Deep tensor genomic imputation Project Summary/Abstract High-throughput sequencing assays allow scientists to measure biochemical properties like transcription factor binding, histone modiﬁcations, and gene expression in nearly any cell line or primary tissue (“biosample”). Unfortunately, measuring all possible biochemical properties in every biosample is infeasible, both because of limited sample availability and because the cost would be prohibitive. We have previously developed a state-of- the-art imputation method, called Avocado, that can ﬁll in the holes in such data sets. Avocado couples tensor factorization with a deep neural network. The method is scalable to large data sets and provides more accurate imputations than competing methods such as ChromImpute or PREDICTD. We have already applied Avocado systematically to the NIH ENCODE data set and made the imputations publicly available via the ENCODE web por tal.  Here, we propose to extend Avocado in four important ways. First, we will extend Avocado to handle single-cell data sets, thereby effectively turning each single-cell experiment into an in silico co-assay that measures multiple properties of each cell in parallel. Second, we will extend Avocado to work with data such as Hi-C, which measures three-dimensional properties of DNA. The extension involves converting Avocado's 3D tensor (biosample assay  genomic position) to a 4D tensor with two genomic position axes. This extension will apply to a wide variety of data types, including various types of Hi-C data, SPRITE, GAM, ChIA-PET and PLAC-seq. Third, we will enhance Avocado to use variant aware genomic sequence to enable high-resolution imputation of regulatory proﬁles. Finally, we will leverage the imputed data to infer cis-regulatory sequence annotations and the molecular impact of regulatory non-coding variants in one of the most comprehensive collections of cellular contexts.  All of the software produced by this project will be open source, and all of the imputed data and latent factorizations will be made publicly available via the web portals associated with the NIH 4D Nucleome and ENCODE Consortia, providing a valuable public resource for users of these data sets. Project narrative High-throughput sequencing can be used to measure many types of biochemical activity along the genome in a huge variety of primary cell types and cell lines (“biosamples”), but it is prohibitively expensive to measure all possible types of activity in all possible biosamples. Accordingly, we have developed a powerful machine learning approach to predict such measurements before they are performed. Here, we propose to increase Avocado's utility by extending the method to work with single-cell data types, to work with 3D genome architecture data, to incorporate information about DNA sequence and to decode regulatory DNA sequence and non-coding genetic variation.",Deep tensor genomic imputation,10096947,R01HG011466,"['3-Dimensional', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Avocado', 'Awareness', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Couples', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hi-C', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'cost', 'data standards', 'deep neural network', 'experimental study', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in silico', 'large datasets', 'next generation', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'syntax', 'transcription factor', 'web portal']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,398567
"Comprehensive mapping of multimodal chromatin state in single cells PROJECT SUMMARY Many non-Mendelian (polygenic) human genetic diseases involve multiple causal loci in noncoding regions of the genome, implicating mutations in regulatory elements rather than protein-coding genes as the cause of these diseases. Deciphering the etiology of these human genetic diseases requires an understanding of how genes are regulated during development and homeostasis to produce functional cell states. This regulation is encoded both through epigenetic chromatin state, and genetically encoded in the DNA sequence of regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters, silencers, and insulators. However, these regulatory elements and their activity states in human cells are not resolvable with current technologies. As aberrant gene regulation likely underlies many human diseases, understanding (1) the function of regulatory DNA elements and (2) their activity dynamics during healthy human development are essential. To address these two problems, I propose to: (i) develop new experimental methods to profile multimodal chromatin state in single cells; (ii) identify alterations in regulatory element activation states that guide cell fate choice during human hematopoiesis; (iii) identify the DNA sequence features important for regulatory element function; (iv) build community tools and resources for the analysis of single-cell chromatin data. Together these aims will provide methods and resources for the interrogation of the human functional genome, and the identification of regulatory state dynamics that generate human cell types. To succeed in achieving these aims, I will pursue additional training supported by co-mentors Dr. Rahul Satija (single-cell biology), Dr. Vijay Sankaran (hematopoiesis), Dr. Danny Reinberg (gene regulation), and Dr. David Knowles (machine learning). I have developed a 5-year career development plan that integrates scientific training in hematopoiesis and gene regulation, practical training and mentorship in deep learning, extensive leadership training through courses and mentorship, and seminars and workshops on academic writing. My team of scientific mentors will provide further guidance and mentorship in academic job searches. The New York Genome Center is an ideal environment for research and further career development, providing the cutting-edge research facilities and opportunities for further career development in a rich interdisciplinary environment. Completion of the proposed research program and career development plan will launch my independent scientific career as a leader in the field of single-cell epigenomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Information in the human genome encodes a multitude of functional cell states. How this information is decoded to produce these states, and how aberrant encodings produce aberrant states, is not well known.

"Measuring functional similarity between transcriptional enhancers using deep learning PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding transcriptional regulation remains as a major task in the molecular biology ﬁeld. Enhancers are genetic elements that regulate when and where genes are expressed and their expression levels. These elements are hard to discover because their locations and orientations are not constrained with respect to their target genes. Several diseases and susceptibility to certain diseases are linked to mutations and variants in enhancers. Multiple experimental and computational methods have been developed for locating enhancers. Computational methods are more suitable to handle the large number of genomes being sequenced now because they are faster, cheaper, and less labor intensive than experimental methods. Despite many available computational tools, we lack a sophisticated tool that can measure similarity in the enhancer activity of a pair of sequences. We propose here utilizing Deep Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (DANNs) to develop such a tool. The long-term objective of this project is to decipher the code governing gene regulation with the following speciﬁc aims: (i) design a computational tool for measuring enhancer-enhancer similarity, (ii) validate up to 96 putative enhancers experimentally, (iii) understand enhancer grammar, and (iv) annotate enhancers in more than 50 insect genomes. To achieve these aims, a novel application of DANNs is proposed. Current tools utilize DANNs to answer a yes-no question: does a sequence have similar activity to the tissue-speciﬁc enhancers comprising a particular training set of known enhancers? These approaches require training a separate network on each tissue, leading to inconsistent performances on different tissues. Instead, here we use a DANN to answer a related but different question: does this sequence have similar enhancer activity to a single known tissue-speciﬁc enhancer? This deep network should perform consistently on different cell types because it is trained on pairs of sequences — not individual sequences as is the case in the available tools — representing all tissues for which there are known enhancers. The DANN is trained to recognize sequence pairs with similar enhancer activities and those with dissimilar activities including (i) two enhancers active in two different tissues, (ii) one enhancer and a random genomic sequence, and (iii) two random genomic sequences. The tool outputs a score between 0 and 1, indicating how similar the enhancer activities of the two sequences are. Using a much simpler machine learning algorithm than DANNs, we demonstrate that pairs with similar enhancer activities can be separated from pairs of random genomic sequences or pairs of one enhancer and a random genomic sequence with a very high accuracy. The new tool has many important potential applications including consistent annotation of enhancers across cell types and related species. Our tool can annotate enhancers active in a cell type that has a small number of known enhancers, and it can annotate enhancers in related genomes when there is a set of known enhancers demarcated in one of them. Discovering new transcription factor binding sites is another potential application. Studying enhancer “design principles” and the effects of variants can be facilitated using the proposed tool. Such applications will advance our ﬁeld. PROJECT NARRATIVE An enhancer is a genetic element that controls when and in which cell type a gene is expressed as well as the expression level. Mutations and variants in enhancers are linked to a number of diseases — including cancer — and may increase the risk of developing certain diseases. We will apply machine learning (a branch of artiﬁcial intelligence) and experimental approaches to developing an advanced computational tool that measures the similarity in enhancer activity between two DNA regions, facilitating the discovery of enhancers and their study.",Measuring functional similarity between transcriptional enhancers using deep learning,10302539,R21HG011507,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding Sites', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diptera', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Distant', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hymenoptera', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Lepidoptera', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Order Coleoptera', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Physiological Processes', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Variant', 'artificial neural network', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic element', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'promoter', 'sequence learning', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY-KINGSVILLE,R21,2021,367891
"Model-based methods for single cell chromatin interactomic data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Millions of cis-regulatory elements (CRE) have been identified in mammalian genomes, which harbor large portion of GWAS variants associated with complex human diseases and traits. Interpreting the regulatory target genes of CRE and GWAS variants remains challenging, as majority of genes are not merely regulated by CREs in close one-dimensional (1D) vicinity. Instead, CREs can form DNA loops and regulate the expression of gene(s) from hundreds of kilobases (Kb) away. Thus, deep understanding of chromatin spatial organization can shed light on gene regulation and disease mechanisms. During the last decade, chromatin conformation capture (3C)-derived technologies (e.g., in situ Hi-C, capture Hi-C, ChIA-PET, PLAC-seq and HiChIP) have been widely used to provide a genome-wide view of chromatin spatial organization. However, these technologies are usually applied to bulk tissue or purified cell lines, and cannot reveal cell-type-specific chromatin interactome within complex tissues. Fortunately, harnessing the power of single cell technologies, single cell Hi-C (scHi-C) and scHi-C-derived multi-modal assays, including single cell Methyl-HiC and single- nucleus methyl-3C, have been rapidly advanced to study chromatin interactome at single cell resolution, providing powerful tools to study chromatin spatial organization in complex tissues and disease relevant cell types. While great strides have been made in scHi-C experimental technologies, computational methods for analyzing scHi-C data are largely lagging behind. The methodological gaps fall mainly in three aspects: (1) Current methods are inefficient to enhance resolution from extremely sparse scHi-C data. (2) Few methods exist for removing systematic biases of scHi-C data within each cell, and adjusting for batch effect across different cells. (3) No method is available to detect Kb resolution cell-type-specific chromatin interactions from scHi-C data. To fill in these gaps, I propose major research directions: (1) develop deep learning-based methods to impute sparse chromatin contacts in each cell, (2) develop non-parametric regression models to remove systematic biases within each cell, and to adjust batch effects across different cells, (3) develop a hybrid approach based on both global and local background models to identify cell-type-specific chromatin interactions, and predict putative target genes of GWAS variants associated with complex human diseases and traits, and (4) develop stand-alone, user-friendly software packages to analyze single cell chromatin interactomic data and disseminate results. Completion of the proposed study will provide robust and user friendly computational methods that allow us to analyze 3D genome organization at single cell resolution and interpret their regulatory role on gene expression and complex human diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization (chromatin interactome) plays a critical role in genome function and gene regulation. In this R35 grant application, I will develop model-based methods for imputing and normalizing chromatin chromatins at single cell resolution, identifying cell-type-specific long-range chromatin interactions, and predicting putative target genes of GWAS variants associated with complex human diseases and traits.",Model-based methods for single cell chromatin interactomic data,10293050,R35HG011922,"['3-Dimensional', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Assay', 'CISH gene', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Hi-C', 'Hybrids', 'In Situ', 'Light', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Play', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Systematic Bias', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'deep learning', 'falls', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'mammalian genome', 'multimodality', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R35,2021,480583
"Design, prediction, and prioritization of systematic perturbations of the human genome ABSTRACT Noncoding genetic variation that alters gene regulation is of paramount importance for health, disease, and evolution. Diseases ranging in incidence from the most common to the most rare all have substantial risk associated with regulatory variation; and most of the genetic differences between closely related species are noncoding. Whole genome sequencing can directly identify that variation but to realize its potential to elucidate the genetic determinants of health and disease, will require accurate annotation of this noncoding variation for functionality. In coding sequence, the genetic code allows variants to be annotated to a rough hierarchy of likely functional effects and pathogenicity. In noncoding sequence such annotation is less clear. Perturbation assays, i.e., assays that modify genetic or epigenetic states and measure the effect of those perturbations on regulatory endpoints, offer a possible path to annotating noncoding variation. However, to fully leverage this data, novel and sophisticated statistical and machine learning approaches are required to extract useful information from those assays, to integrate that information across regulatory endpoints, and to extrapolate findings so that annotation of previously unobserved (unperturbed) variation in diverse cell types is possible. The goal of the Duke Prediction Center is to develop the analytic approaches and tools that will allow for the routine annotation of noncoding variation for functionality and ultimately pathogenicity. Aim 1 is to establish best practices in perturbation assay design and analysis. This will allow IGVF characterization centers design their experiments so that, when coupled with optimized analyses, the data produced will be maximally informative for subsequent predictive modeling. Aim 2 is to develop novel mechanistic machine learning approaches for predicting the functional effect of noncoding variation on function in diverse cell-types. Aim 3 is to identify noncoding genomic regions that are subject to functional constraint which will be leveraged in prioritizing variants for pathogenicity. The expected outcomes of this project will be (i) robust estimates of optimal experimental design parameters and recommendations for analysis tools and best practices for the various assays used within the IGVF consortium, (ii) predicted functional effects of observed variation to be shared through the IGVF variant/phenotype catalog as well as a state-of-the-art machine learning method (and associated tools) that can identify previously-unknown interactions among genomic variants, both observed and novel, and predict their functional impact in diverse cell types, and (iii) a list of regulatory elements subject to functional constraint shared through the IGVF variant/phenotype catalog and a principled prioritization framework (and associated tools) for interpreting variation within patient genomes for pathogenicity. Due to the considerable success of genetics, there are thousands of unknown regulatory causes of disease. Each of those causes is an opportunity to improve treatment, diagnostics, or prevention. This project will be a major advance towards unlocking that potential. PROJECT NARRATIVE The culmination of the proposal will be a systematic and comprehensive approach for interpreting noncoding variants to understand the underlying mechanisms that link genetics to gene expression and causes of human disease. That outcome will transform human disease studies by allowing noncoding sequence variation to inform genetic causes of disease, both in novel disease gene discovery studies and in the diagnostic interpretation of individual patient genomes.","Design, prediction, and prioritization of systematic perturbations of the human genome",10295506,U01HG011967,"['Address', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalogs', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Computational Biology', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End Point Assay', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Explosion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Recommendation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gene discovery', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,353667
"Linking genome variation to transcriptional network dynamics in human B cells B cells of the immune system are a leading model for the analysis of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and cell type specific transcriptional control mechanisms. They represent a featured mammalian cell state in the ENCODE project for in depth chromatin and transcription factor profiling. Furthermore, the loci encoding the antibody heavy and light chain genes (IgH and IgL) have been used to uncover novel mechanisms of somatic DNA recombination and hypermutation that enable the generation of highly diverse antibody repertoires and affinity maturation in response to pathogen encounters or vaccines. Importantly, variation in the human B cell regulatory genome has been associated with autoimmune diseases and vaccine responses. In spite of these impressive advances, there has not been a comprehensive attempt to delineate the cis-regulome of primary human B cells in their resting, activated and terminally differentiated states or to assemble a signaling induced gene regulatory network that controls the activation dynamics and differentiation of B cells. This has impeded efforts to systematically analyze the consequences of genomic variation on the structure and temporal dynamics of the underlying B cell regulatory network in human health and disease. Based on our success in assembling the first comprehensive cis-regulome for primary murine B cells by coupling structural and functional genomics, an inter-disciplinary team is proposing to address the two major challenges highlighted above for human B cells. Thus, we hope to advance a generalizable framework for analyzing the causal connections between human genome variation and dynamic gene network regulation in diverse biological contexts. B cells of the immune system are a leading model for the analysis of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), and variation in the human B cell regulatory genome has been associated with autoimmune diseases and differential vaccine responses. However, there has not been a comprehensive attempt to delineate the cis-regulome of primary human B cells in their resting, activated and terminally differentiated states or to assemble corresponding dynamic GRNs. Based on our recent success in assembling the first comprehensive murine B cell cis-regulome, our inter-disciplinary team is proposing to assemble a human B cell cis-regulome and corresponding dynamic GRNs, and study the consequences of disease-associated non-coding variation in the context of these dynamic GRNs.",Linking genome variation to transcriptional network dynamics in human B cells,10297231,U01HG012041,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B cell differentiation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Computer Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'FAIRE sequencing', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Immunologist', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Plasma Cells', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'experimental analysis', 'functional genomics', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic profiles', 'genomic variation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'response', 'screening', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vaccine response']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2021,950000
"Defining causal roles of genomic variants on gene regulatory networks with spatiotemporally-resolved single-cell multiomics PROJECT SUMMARY A fundamental question in biology is to understand how genetic variation affects genome function to influence phenotypes. The majority of genetic variants associated with human diseases are located within non-coding genomic regions and may affect genome functions and phenotypes through modulating the activity of cis- regulatory elements and cell-type specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, our knowledge about the impact of genomic variants (alone or as combinations) on gene expression, GRN activity and ultimately cellular phenotypes are rather limited. Further, because transcription factors (TFs) and related cis-regulatory elements are known to have distinct functions based on cell-type and state, how genomic variants influence cell-type/state-specific activity of functional elements and phenotypes remains to be characterized in much greater details. This proposal aims to leverage a panel of multi-ethnic, gender-balanced human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines (European, African American and African hunter gatherers) as well as recent advances in single- cell time-resolved or multi-omics technologies, predictive modeling of regulatory networks by machine learning and high throughput single-cell perturbation methods to study the functional impact of genomic variations on regulatory network, cellular phenotypes. First, we will establish a robust experimental framework of deploying advanced time-resolved and multi-omic single-cell technologies for detecting functional genetic variants at single-cell level. Next, we will develop novel computational methods for integration of single-cell data across different modalities and for accurate reconstruction and predictive modeling of GRNs driving cellular identify, developmental dynamics (cardiac and neural lineage cell fate transition). Finally, we will apply high-throughput combinatorial genetic or epigenetic perturbation approaches to modulate activity of key genes or putative cis- regulatory elements at single-cell levels to improve our understanding of network level relationships among genomic variants and phenotypes. PROJECT NARRATIVE A fundamental question in biology is to understand how genetic variation affects genome function to influence phenotypes. Our in-depth characterization of functional impact of genomic variation on human developmental gene regulatory networks in ancestrally diverse populations will provide critical insights into human development and diseases and have the potential to greatly help translating disease risk alleles to therapeutic targets.",Defining causal roles of genomic variants on gene regulatory networks with spatiotemporally-resolved single-cell multiomics,10297331,U01HG012047,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Adherent Culture', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bar Codes', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Human Genetics', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multipotent Stem Cells', 'Organism', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Washington', 'base', 'biological systems', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome editing', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genomic tools', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'mRNA sequencing', 'member', 'methylome', 'multi-ethnic', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'risk variant', 'single cell technology', 'single molecule', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell differentiation', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U01,2021,1210000
"Genomic control of gene regulatory networks governing early human lineage decisions ABSTRACT  Predicting the impact of genomic variation requires quantitative modeling to deconstruct the interplay between multiple individual variants and to determine their combined effects on gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that control cell state and cell function. We focus on the GRNs that control early human development as a paradigm. Arguably the most important lineage decision during mammalian development is the decision of epiblast cells to exit the pluripotent state (a state when the cells have the potential to give rise to all somatic cells and germ cells), and differentiate into one of the three primary germ layers, the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. This pluripotent state and the trilineage differentiation can be captured using cultured human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Much attention has focused on the GRNs underlying the maintenance of the self-renewing pluripotent state, but the GRNs governing hESC trilineage differentiation remain largely unexplored. We previously conducted genome-scale CRISPR/Cas screens to discover protein-coding genes that regulate the transition of hESCs to definitive endoderm. Based on the genomic and genetic data and machine learning (gkm-SVM sequence analysis), we expanded our initial simple two transcription factor (TF) model to a multiple TF cooperative model. Here we propose an integrative approach examining the hESC transition to definitive endoderm, mesoderm and neuroectoderm germ layer identities to improve the generalizability of GRN models. We will perform quantitative genomic and proteomic measurements with high temporal and single-cell resolution. These quantitative measurements will be combined with perturbation of key GRN elements, core TFs and their target enhancers, to inform the generation of dynamic GRN models. To further improve the precision of our new GRN models, we will map cell trajectories during state transitions through lineage tracing combined with scRNA-seq. Beyond hESC guided differentiation, the physiological relevance of enhancers will be further interrogated in human and mouse organoids (gastruloids) and mouse embryos. We will then apply innovative new computational and algorithmic methods to our multimodal experimental data to generate GRN models, aiming to learn generalizable principles underlying the contribution of genomic variants to cellular and ultimately organismal phenotypes. Developing GRN models for the exit of pluripotency and the acquisition of germ layer identities involves dynamic modeling of the cell state transition, which will not only inform our understanding of early human development, but can also serve as the basis for construction of generalizable GRN models for biological transitions during embryonic development, adult tissue homeostasis and regeneration as well as inappropriate cell fate transitions that occur in pathological conditions such as cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE)  This project will construct models of gene regulatory networks controlling early human development by taking an integrative approach involving perturbation of core regulatory network elements, quantitative genomic and proteomic measurements with high temporal and single-cell resolution, and systems level analyses. Knowledge gained from the study will provide a conceptual framework for dissecting gene regulatory networks during cell state transitions, and reveal general features of genomic variants that contribute to cellular and organismal phenotypes.",Genomic control of gene regulatory networks governing early human lineage decisions,10297375,U01HG012051,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Adult', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin Conformation Capture and Sequencing', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Computations', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Endoderm', 'Enhancers', 'Epiblast', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Germ Cells', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hi-C', 'Histones', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Mesoderm', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neuroectoderm', 'Organoids', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Cell', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'pluripotency', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'self-renewal', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell differentiation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2021,1330000
"The impact of genomic variation on environment-induced changes in pancreatic beta cell states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Pancreatic beta cells secrete insulin in order to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. Insulin secretion is tightly regulated by glucose and modulated by numerous environmental signals, including other nutrients, hormones, and inflammatory cytokines. Exposure of beta cells to environmental signals affects gene regulatory programs within hours, and these signal-dependent changes serve to adapt insulin secretion to changes in organismal states. Genetic variants associated with measures of insulin secretion are strongly enriched in genomic elements active in beta cells, and many of these variants are also associated with risk of diabetes. Beta cells therefore possess characteristics that make them an ideal cellular model for studying signal-dependent gene regulatory processes relevant to human health and disease. However, the specific genomic programs that drive signal- induced state changes in beta cells remain poorly characterized. Recent advances in the development of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived multi-cellular islet organoid models by us and others provide a genetically tractable beta cell model for linking genomic activity to cellular phenotypes. Our group has further pioneered the development of numerous single cell assays, including chromatin accessibility, ultra-high-throughput paired chromatin accessibility and gene expression, and paired 3D chromatin interactions and DNA methylation; methods that we have successfully applied to both primary human islets and hPSC-islet organoids. We have further developed machine learning and network-based approaches for variant interpretation including from single cell RNA and epigenetic data. In this proposal we will develop novel gene regulatory network (GRN) models to predict network-level relationships among genomic elements, genes, and phenotypes derived from single cell multiomic maps charting signal- and time-dependent changes in hPSC-islet organoids. In Sections B and C we will measure genomic element activity, gene expression, and insulin secretion in hPSC-islet organoids exposed to ten different secretory signals each across four time points using paired single nucleus accessible chromatin and gene expression and paired single cell DNA methylation and 3D chromatin architecture assays. In Section D we will generate a GRN from these data, use machine learning to infer element-gene and element-phenotype relationships and use the trained models to refine the GRN. From the resulting GRN we will predict the effects of genetic variants in specific genomic elements on target gene expression, gene network activity, and cellular phenotype. In Section E we will validate and refine models by using medium-scale CRISPR interference of genomic elements individually and in combination as well as allele-specific gene editing of selected glucose-associated variants in hPSC-islet organoids and measuring gene expression changes in cis and trans. Together, the results, data, and methods from this project using a model of a cell type which both rapidly responds to environmental signals and has a quantifiable phenotypic output will be widely applicable to the community studying the dynamics of genomic regulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fine-tuned regulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic islet beta cells in response to environmental signals is critical for human health and survival. Our proposal will apply systematic, single cell-resolved multiomic data collection in human pluripotent stem cell-derived islet organoids exposed to secretory signals to predict and validate network-level relationships among genomic elements, genes, and insulin secretion phenotypes.",The impact of genomic variation on environment-induced changes in pancreatic beta cell states,10297450,U01HG012059,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Beta Cell', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Glucose', 'CRISPR interference', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Glucose', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Islets of Langerhans', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Network-based', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nutrient', 'Organoids', 'Output', 'Pancreas', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure of beta Cell of islet', 'Study models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'cytokine', 'diabetes risk', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insulin regulation', 'insulin secretion', 'islet', 'islet stem cells', 'model building', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'pancreatic juice', 'programs', 'response', 'stem cells', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2021,1280000
"Predicting context-specific molecular and phenotypic effects of genetic variation through the lens of the cis-regulatory code ABSTRACT A central challenge in human genomics is to interpret the regulatory functions of the noncoding genome, and to identify and interpret variants with regulatory functions. In this project we plan to leverage recent advances in experimental functional genomics (including single cell methods and high throughput perturbation methods) alongside recent progress in deep learning models of gene regulation, to make fundamental progress on these problems. We have assembled a team of investigators with diverse and complementary expertise – in deep learning, single-cell genomics, cellular QTLs and GWAS, and high throughput validations – to build, test, and implement predictive models for interpreting disease associations. Specifically, we aim to (1) Develop interpretable base-resolution deep-learning models for regulatory sequences; (2) Predict and validate cell type- specific effects of regulatory variants on molecular phenotypes and disease; (3) Collaborate with the IGVF Consortium to build nucleotide-level regulatory maps. Our ultimate goal in this project will be to create a nucleotide-resolution cis-regulatory map of the human genome to connect disease variants to functions and phenotypes, in diverse cell types, states, and spatial contexts.

"Deciphering the Genomics of Gene Network Regulation of T Cell and Fibroblast States in Autoimmune Inflammation Abstract Natural genetic variation impacts most human diseases, yet predicting how regulatory variants control gene expression and ultimately disease phenotypes poses considerable challenges. First, the polygenic inheritance influencing most conditions requires consideration of a vast number of genes and regulatory elements. This task is challenged by the complexity of gene regulation, where 3D regulatory interactions can link enhancers and genes over large genomic distances. Second, multiple interacting cell types are often dysregulated in disease pathology. This necessitates an understanding of how the collective variants associating with a disease affect each cell type involved in the disease process and subsequently how these dysregulated cellular phenotypes crossregulate and drive subsequent cellular states. In this IGVF project, we will use rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a human autoimmune inflammatory disease, as a case study to develop robust machine learning models of gene regulation to decipher the impact of genomic variation on multiple cellular drivers of pathology—namely, inflammatory T cell and fibroblast subsets found in affected joint tissue. The choice of RA is motivated by its public health importance, specified target tissue, access to clinical samples, considerable knowledge of disease-associated gene loci, and our team’s complementary expertise in machine learning, RA pathophysiology, immunology and inflammation, and single-cell functional genomics. We will develop an advanced machine learning framework to model the effects of allelic variation on gene regulatory networks based on the analysis of epigenomes, transcriptomes, and connectomes of mouse activated T cells and synovial fibroblasts and extend these models to RA patient joint tissue and primary cells. We will train allele-specific gene regulatory models (GRMs) that account for long-range regulatory interactions by integrating single-cell transcriptome and epigenome (sc-multiome) data with bulk 3D interactome analyses. A notable feature of our approach is that we leverage the genetic diversity of evolutionarily distant F1 hybrid mice to provide robust training data for these models, and then apply these advances to the human context through transfer learning. Highly parallelized Perturb-seq experiments in primary synovial fibroblasts from RA patients with single-cell multiomic readouts will then be used to evaluate and refine regulatory models and to train network models that connect gene expression programs to phenotype. Finally, we will combine spatial and single-cell transcriptomics conducted on samples from RA inflamed joints to model the organization and interactions between T cells and sedentary tissue-organizing fibroblasts within local cellular communities. The predictive GRMs that will be generated from our study along with the experimental systems for human disease will be readily transferrable to other polygenic disorders which must consider complex regulatory genomic networks for various interacting cell types in affected tissues. Narrative We will develop advanced machine learning approaches to combine single-cell multiomic and bulk 3D interactome data to model the impact of genetic variation on gene regulation, using rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a disease model. Our gene regulatory models and experimental analyses will focus on two cell types that drive RA tissue pathology—T cells and synovial fibroblasts—and will serve as a case study for examining the genetics of polygenic human diseases that dysregulate multiple interacting cell types within affected tissues.",Deciphering the Genomics of Gene Network Regulation of T Cell and Fibroblast States in Autoimmune Inflammation,10305241,U01HG012103,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Autoimmune', 'CAST/EiJ Mouse', 'Case Study', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Distant', 'Enhancers', 'Etiology', 'Fibroblasts', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'In Situ', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Organizational Models', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'T cell regulation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'arthropathies', 'autoimmune inflammation', 'cell community', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'disease phenotype', 'empowered', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genomic locus', 'genomic variation', 'human data', 'human disease', 'intercellular communication', 'joint inflammation', 'learning strategy', 'mouse genetics', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'sedentary', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2021,1280000
"Using Syntenic Gapped-kmer Composition to Detect Conserved Enhancers where Sequence Alignment Fails While thousands of genomic loci have been associated with common human disease, translating these disease associations to clinical impact is often limited by lack of appropriate human cell lines and our inability to unambiguously identify orthologous regulatory regions for studies in model organisms. Sequence alignment, the most frequently used method to detect evolutionary conservation of enhancers and promoters, accurately identifies genes and promoters, but often fails to detect many functionally conserved distal enhancers, in spite of the fact that orthologous TFs generally have conserved binding activity. We have developed a machine learning approach to identify the set of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) active in cell-type specific enhancers from epigenomic data using a gapped-kmer features that encompasses all possible TFBS (gkm-SVM), and this classifier can distinguish active enhancers from non-active regions. This DNA sequence based model can accurately predict enhancer activity in massively parallel reporter assays and the impact of variation in regulatory elements associated with human disease (deltaSVM). The central aim of this proposal is to develop a new computational method using the syntenic gapped-kmer composition to detect functionally conserved regulatory elements missed by conventional sequence alignment methods. Previous studies of enhancer evolution across mammals using sequence alignment have reported that promoters are more conserved than enhancers, and that enhancers are evolving rapidly. In contrast, using gapped k-mers, we find that cell-type specific enhancers and promoters in matched ENCODE/Roadmap tissues are equally functionally conserved, and that gapped k-mers can identify conserved enhancers that are undetectable by sequence alignment. We hypothesize that the improvements relative to sequence alignment methods arise because the gapped-kmer feature space is able to detect similarity between rearrangements and variations of TF binding sites which may vary at gapped positions but which retain similar binding affinities. We will develop a method to detect conserved regulatory regions using the gkm-SVM kernel as a metric of sequence conservation and optimize this method by comparing to genome-wide functional data. We will then develop algorithms to detect long range syntenic intervals of similar gapped k-mer composition and generate genome- wide maps of evolutionary conservation. We will validate the predictions with CRISPRi in human and mouse stem cells differentiated to endoderm. We propose to develop methods to use syntenic gapped-kmer sequence composition to generate maps of evolutionarily conserved regulatory regions and validate these predictions in human and mouse. This project will significantly contribute to our understanding of regulatory element constraint and evolution and will significantly enhance our ability use model organisms to study how human genetic variation contributes to common disease.",Using Syntenic Gapped-kmer Composition to Detect Conserved Enhancers where Sequence Alignment Fails,10480233,R56HG012110,"['ATAC-seq', 'Active Sites', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR interference', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endoderm', 'Enhancers', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'MADH2 gene', 'MADH4 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Promoter Regions', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Role', 'SOX17 gene', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'jun Oncogene', 'knock-down', 'promoter', 'screening', 'stem cell differentiation', 'success', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,388975
"Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development Abstract Craniofacial abnormalities are some of the most commonly occurring human birth defects worldwide, with up to 200,000 children born every year with some type of craniofacial defect. These defects can occur as part of complex syndromes that involve multiple tissues and organs. The syndromic forms of these disorders have been successfully linked to nearly 500 genes including TWIST1 for craniosynostosis and IRF6 for orofacial clefting. However more frequently no other part of the body is directly involved (50% of craniosynostoses, 70% of orofacial clefts). Genome wide association studies indicate heritability for such defects, however the vast majority of associations fall outside of genes suggesting defective gene regulation is a major contributor to incidence of such defects. Gene regulatory elements can be located throughout the genome and typically have tissue-specific activity, making them difficult to identify and predict what gene they control. The overall objective of this application is to integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets from early human and mouse craniofacial development from our lab as well as FaceBase to comprehensively predict regulatory element-gene interactions. Our hypothesis posits that conserved regulatory networks between human and mouse are enriched for disease relevant biology. In Aim 1 we propose to systematically identify chromatin states in human from 4.5 to 8 weeks of gestation and in mouse from embryonic days 9.5 to 15.5. In Aim 2 we propose to identify genes that are coordinately regulated in both species across these developmental windows. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to integrate these two disparate network types to identify regulatory element-gene pairings. We will experimentally validate predicted interactions in a culture model of cranial neural crest cells using proximity-ligation coupled with immunoprecipitation. Our proposed studies will generate the most comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptomic networks in a developing human tissue and for the first time identify the conserved regulatory architecture for building the mammalian orofacial complex. Defects in embryonic patterning resulting in clefts of orofacial tissue are common birth defects affecting more than 1 in 1000 live births. The genetic causes of these defects have been difficult to determine, but all current evidence suggests defective gene regulation during embryonic development underlies these birth defects. This project seeks to identify regulatory networks that control gene expression during craniofacial development and are conserved between human and mouse.",Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development,10083207,R03DE028588,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Body part', 'Cephalic', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coupled', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Neural Crest Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Syndrome', 'TWIST1 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computational pipelines', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'differential expression', 'embryo tissue', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'falls', 'gene interaction', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'human tissue', 'multiple omics', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'programs', 'promoter', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R03,2021,164000
"Integrating Biology into In Silico Methodologies: Modern approaches for incorporating biological reasoning and understanding into computational methods. 1 This proposal is for PA-18-648, NIH Support for Conferences and Scientific Meetings –  2 funding intended to help finance a two-day standalone “SOT CCT” workshop titled Integrating  3 Biology into In Silico Methodologies: Modern Approaches for incorporating biological  4 reasoning and understanding into computational methods. As a “Contemporary Concepts  5 in Toxicology” meeting, this workshop has the full backing, including being financially  6 underwritten, by the Society of Toxicology.  7 Computational modeling is an important tool for assessing the safety and use of  8 chemicals across many industries, including chemical, pharmaceutical, and consumer products.  9 Moreover, in silico methodologies offer academia and regulatory a fast and cheap method of 10 prioritizing its efforts to maintain compliance and safety in the market and environment. 11 This conference is designed to promote the development of actionable insights and 12 methodologies for increasing the biological relevance of in silico solutions. Specifically, this 13 conference will focus on solving the “black box effect”. There are many ways to validate a 14 model’s accuracy and domain – however if the model cannot explain what is happening 15 biologically, its use is severely diminished. This workshop will bring together regulatory, 16 academia, industry, and service providers to discuss current solutions and efforts, as well as 17 ongoing and future research. One goal of this conference will be to develop a roadmap for the 18 incorporation of AOPs (and similar biological reasonings) for computational tools. 19 This workshop has great appeal for multiple stakeholders within toxicology, namely 20 industry, academia, regulators, as well as service providers. The use of machine-learning to 21 replace laboratory toxicological tests is paramount to the future of the industry (3Rs). The use 22 of in silico models are explicitly referenced by NICEATM’s U.S. Strategic Roadmap, as well as 23 TSCA. Moreover, many industries and regulatory entities are taking significant steps away from 24 animal testing. Most recently, the US EPA stated that it will eliminate animal testing by 2035. 25 This workshop will bring together different stakeholders to discuss the current state of 26 AOPs and in silico methodologies, and to work towards a unified approach for their 27 incorporation. The final outcome of the workshop will be a white-paper that not only reviews the 28 current landscape but discusses concretes steps, as outlined in the breakout session, needed 29 for the regulatory acceptance of machine learning technologies – specifically a roadmap for the 30 inclusion of AOPs into computational tools and explanations.

"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biologicalpathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of  information  from  the  NIH’s  ENCODE  project.  We  will  characterize  which  transcriptional  regulators  are  most  likely  responsible  for  perturbed  gene  expression,  their  signaling pathways and downstream targets. Previously unknown or understudied networks or genes identified  targeted for further analyses in placental growth and maturity and future prospective clinical studies.        PROJECT NARRATIVE    The normal development of the placental is essential for optimal pregnancy outcomes, and understanding normal  and  pathological  placental  development  will  allow  new  opportunities  to  prevent  major  public  health  concerns  such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. This work will seek to develop new, non-­ invasive  strategies  to  monitor  human  placental  maturation,  reflecting  normal  development,  against  which  deviations can be determined earlier in pregnancy for more effective interventions.   ","Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems

"Determining lineage decisions and gene regulatory networks governing the generation of key progenitor cell types during early human brain development Abstract The long term goal of this proposal is to quantitatively understand how gene regulatory networks (GRNs) generate the diversity of cell types during the development of the human brain. The focus of this proposal is to determine how key progenitor cell types that are uniquely enriched in humans are generated. Such an understanding is essential for uncovering the mechanisms of human developmental diseases. There are three challenges to achieving this goal: 1. Ethical issues in working with developing human tissue, 2. Computational and experimental techniques to determine the sequence of progenitor cell states and state transitions that give rise to the diversity of cell types, 3. the difficultly in building quantitative models of the gene regulatory networks in the absence of data to determine the thousands of biochemical constants. The approach of the proposal is to build the necessary computational, mathematical and experimental framework to overcome these challenges. To recapitulate early human brain development, the proposal will employ an in vitro human embryonic stem cell differentiation system. To obtain snapshots of the underlying gene regulatory network, high throughput single cell sequencing will be employed to obtain transcriptional profiles of thousands of single cells during the course of development. The challenge of inferring the sequence of cell states and cell state transitions will be overcome through a novel statistical method to obtain a joint probability distribution of the cell states, sequence of transitions and a key set of genes whose dynamics reflect these states and transitions. The inferences will be tested by mapping to in vivo data and using viral lineage tracing. The origins of forebrain and outer radial glial cells (oRG) progenitors uniquely enriched in the developing human forebrain will thus be determined. The challenge of building predictive models will be overcome by using methods from theoretical physics and ensemble modeling from statistics to build models that make probabilistic predictions. By using the available data as constraints on the model, the framework will extract joint probability distributions of all the parameters of the model. These distribution functions will then be used to produce probabilistic predictions about the responses of the underlying GRNs to perturbations. High probability predictions will be tested experimentally by perturbing gene expression and signaling during early brain development and the model will be iteratively improved. The success of this proposal will result in the first quantitative model of the gene regulatory network controlling the generation of forebrain and the oRG progenitor cells. If achieved, this work therefore would represent a major insight into the molecular and cellular events that give rise to the disproportionately gyrated human brain. Narrative The project seeks to gain a quantitative understanding of the molecular networks within cells that control the generation of key progenitor cell types that arise during human brain development. To do so, it will develop modeling and computational tools as well as test these tools on human embryonic stem cell lines. In the longer term, a quantitative understanding of the circuits within cells that control development will allow us to uncover mechanisms underlying developmental disease.",Determining lineage decisions and gene regulatory networks governing the generation of key progenitor cell types during early human brain development,10140399,R01HD100036,"['Animal Model', 'Bar Codes', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Ethical Issues', 'Event', 'Forebrain Development', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'LHX2 gene', 'Lentils - dietary', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neocortex', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Organism', 'Physics', 'Probability', 'Prosencephalon', 'RNA', 'Radial', 'Regulator Genes', 'Role', 'SOX11 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'WNT Signaling Pathway', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'course development', 'developmental disease', 'glial cell development', 'human data', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'human fetus tissue', 'human stem cells', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'molecular marker', 'neocortical', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cells', 'subventricular zone', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NICHD,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,473866
"AICORE-kids: Artificial Intelligence COVID-19 Risk AssEssment for kids This work is directed at characterizing pediatric COVID-19 and stratifying incoming patients by projected (future) disease severity. Such stratification has several implications: immediately improving treatment planning, and as disease mechanistic pathways are uncovered, directing treatment. Predicting future severity will inform the risks of outpatient treatment; to the patients themselves, their family, other caregivers/cohabitants, and to schools and employers. As varying levels of “reopening” are adopted across the country (and the world), such prognostication will inform policy on the handling of pediatric carriers in the community. Based on our preliminary analysis we assert that a combination of novel assays including quantitative serology inflammatory markers (cytokine/chemokine profiles, immune profiles), transcriptomics, epigenomics, longitudinal physiological monitoring, time series analysis, imaging, radiomics and clinical observation including social determinants of health, contains adequate information even at early stages of infection to stratify the disease and predict disease severity. We propose an artificial intelligence/machine learning approach to integrate this rich and heterogeneous dataset, characterize the spectrum of disease and identify biosignatures that predict severity in progressive disease. To facilitate translation of the approaches developed in this work to a wide user community, we incorporate a Translational Development function, to oversee the design-control process and ensure readiness of our methods for regulatory review.

"Hit-and-Run transcription: The impact of transient interactions in dynamic gene regulatory networks that mediate rapid nutrient signaling Project Summary: This grant exploits TIME - the 4th and largely unexplored dimension of transcription - to capture transient interactions in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that are important, but missed, in vivo. This is because genome- scale methods to capture transcription factor (TF) target interactions favor stable binding, and reporter gene studies which detect transient TF-target interactions in seconds, miss global responses needed for GRN models. We aim to fill the time-gap in our collective knowledge of dynamic GRNs by experimentally capturing transient TF-target interactions globally using a cell-based temporal TF perturbation assay (Aims 1 & 2), and evaluate their importance in forecasting gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3), a main goal of systems biology. We model temporal GRNs controlling nitrogen (N)-signaling in plants, but our approaches are broadly applicable. We exploit a cell-based assay for temporal TF perturbation, TARGET, which captures transient TF-target interactions genome-wide; i) by TF-mediated gene regulation even in the absence of detectable TF-binding, ii) within minutes of controlled TF nuclear entry, and iii) identifies highly transient TF-binding leading to sustained transcription by affinity-capture of de novo mRNAs. We discovered that i) a single TF can stably or transiently bind to, and induce or repress, distinct sets of targets depending on their cis-context, ii) that transient TF-targets captured only in cells control early N-responses in planta, for two master TFs in our GRNs (bZIP1 & NLP7). This genome-wide data supports a Hit-and-Run transcription model, where a TF Hit can initiate a stable transcriptional complex, including recruitment of TF partners, enabling transcription to continue after the initiating TF is no longer bound, the Run. This could allow a small number of TF molecules to rapidly affect a large number of target genes by acting catalytically. Our studies have been cited and influenced thinking of transient transcription mechanisms across yeast, stems cells, and were invoked to explain the new discovery of transient binding of Zelda/Bicoid to a reporter gene in Drosophila. Herein, we deploy experimental and computational innovations to test the pervasiveness and in vivo significance of a conceptual innovation - transient Hit-and- Run interactions in GRNs. Our experimental innovations include; i) Assays for Hit-and-Run activity across all 70 TF families in Arabidopsis, using a higher throughput version of the cell-based TARGET assay we recently published, ii) new methods to capture TF-target interactions using time-series biotin-ChIP and DamID, which leaves DNA methylation marks on transient TF-target interactions, supported by preliminary data (Aims 1 & 2). Our computational innovations include: i) ConnectTF, a platform to integrate TF-DNA binding and RNA-seq data and identify candidate Hit-and-Run TFs, and approaches to assess the in planta relevance of transient TF- target interactions in GRNs, such as ii) our newly published Network Walking method, and iii) OutPredict, a new time-based method to forecast gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3). Our experimental & computational approaches are broadly applicable and our results are relevant to environmental N-use affecting human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This work illustrates a combined experimental and computational approach to discover gene regulatory networks in a pathway, process, or trait - applied across a range of problems in biology, agriculture and medicine.

"Resolving single-cell brain regulatory elements with bulk data supervised models Gene regulation is an important determinant of the complex specialization of cells in the human brain, and nucleotide changes within regulatory elements contribute to risk for psychiatric disorders. We therefore hypothesize that these debilitating diseases are driven in part by genetic variants that alter gene expression and disturb the balance and function of cell types in brain tissue. Single-cell open chromatin assays are a promising approach to testing this hypothesis by mapping variants to regulatory elements specific to and shared across cell populations. There are two major barriers to this strategy, for which our project proposes modeling solutions. First, despite being the best assay currently, single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) suffers from low resolution, meaning that an open chromatin region may be supported by zero or few reads in a given cell. This makes it hard to identify coherent cell populations. We propose a network model for semi-supervised clustering of cells in scATAC-seq that leverages information from higher-coverage bulk tissue experiments and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), if available. The expected outcomes from applying this model to compendia of brain data from public repositories and our collaborators are (i) identification of open chromatin regions that differentiate cell types and states, and (ii) discovery of resolved cell populations whose open chromatin is enriched for psychiatric disorder associated genetic variants. These results alone may not be enough to develop a mechanistic understanding of how variants impact brain function. To address this second challenge, we will implement a computationally efficient, machine-learning framework for predicting the specific regulatory functions of single-cell open chromatin regions from our network model and other approaches. Gene regulatory enhancers are particularly amenable to this approach, because high-throughput mouse transgenics and massively parallel reporter assays have generated enough validated enhancers for supervised learning. Our framework will be easy to apply to other regulatory functions, such as insulating boundaries in chromatin capture data. By developing a compressed, yet flexible, featurization of massive bulk and single-cell data compendia, we will enable rapid iteration with computationally intensive prediction algorithms to be applied to single-cell open chromatin regions. Our approach will also incorporate transfer learning from data-rich (e.g., postmortem or mouse brains) to data-poor settings (e.g., human late-gestation brains). We expect predicted regulatory elements to be more enriched for psychiatric disorder genetic risk, to provide mechanistic insight regarding how variants cause disease, and to be useful molecular tools. Together our two proposed computational approaches will leverage the complementary strengths of bulk and single-cell data to resolve regulatory elements that drive the exquisite diversity of cells in developing and adult brains towards mapping the non-coding contribution of psychiatric disease. The human brain is a complex tissue comprised of diverse cell types with distinct gene regulation and function, making it difficult to mechanistically link genetic mutations to differences in brain health. This project will develop a network model and machine-learning framework that leverage single-cell and bulk genomics data to identify genome sequences that control gene expression in specific cell populations and states. We hypothesize that these cell type resolved regulatory elements will shed light on how sequence variants outside protein-coding genes increase risk for psychiatric disorders.",Resolving single-cell brain regulatory elements with bulk data supervised models,10144503,R01MH123178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Censuses', 'Chickens', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neuraxis', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'XCL1 gene', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'egg', 'epigenomics', 'equilibration disorder', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'multiple data types', 'network models', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'promoter', 'psychiatric genomics', 'public repository', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'web server', 'whole genome']",NIMH,J.

"A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT  The incidence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders has been increasing for decades, leaving millions of afflicted individuals. Despite the high heritability, their underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Most risk loci are located in noncoding genomic elements without direct effects on protein products. Comprehensive functional annotation and variant impact quantification are essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand how genetic variants contribute to psychiatric diseases. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR-seq) with population-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the genetic regulatory grammar in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and to prioritize genetic variants in psychiatric disorders. Specifically, we will (1) dissect the cis- regulatory landscape of the PFC using population-scale epigenetics data, (2) construct multi- model gene regulatory networks by linking distal cis-regulatory elements to genes using chromatin co-variability analyses, (3) integrate genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data to identify key transcription factors and variants that contribute to psychiatric disorders. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on one genome, this proposed work presents a truly novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles from hundreds of individuals. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements will expand the number of known functional regions in the human brain by at least an order. We will release our methods and resources in the form of web services, distributed open-source software, and annotation databases, which will also benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders.  In addition to its scientific content, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in computational genomics and neurogenetics. This training will take place at Yale University (in the Dept. of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry) under the mentorship of Prof. Mark Gerstein (functional genomics), Prof. Nenad Sestan (neurogenetics), and Prof. Hongyu Zhao (statistical genetics and machine learning). A committee of experienced psychiatric disease experts and data scientists will also provide advice on both scientific research and career development. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to discover cis- regulatory elements in the noncoding genome by incorporating novel functional characterization technologies (such as STARR-seq) with genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data from psychiatric patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely on a single genome, this work assumes a dynamic regulatory program in each individual and explores the regulatory heterogeneity across hundreds of epigenomes, thereby significantly expanding our current knowledge of the noncoding genome and facilitating functional interpretation of genetic variants. Furthermore, it will also generate publicly available annotation resources and software packages for the scientific community, thereby significantly accelerating the pace of novel therapeutic target discovery for treating psychiatric disorders.",A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders,10219797,K01MH123896,"['Affect', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Entropy', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'genomic profiles', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenetics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'open source', 'programs', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'web services']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K01,2021,111394
"Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia Project Summary Schizophrenia (SCZ) genomics has achieved unprecedented advances. A decade ago, there was perhaps one solid finding, and there are now ~270 loci that meet consensus criteria for significance and replication. As observed for other complex psychiatric disorders, the identified regions are overwhelmingly noncoding, strongly suggesting that genetic variation in gene regulatory elements is a major mechanistic contributor. Further investigation of those regulatory mechanisms is precluded by a fundamental gap in the ability to identify, characterize, and quantify brain-relevant regulatory elements, and limited understanding of how genetic variation within those elements influences their function. To address this knowledge gap, this project will comprehensively identify, characterize, quantify, and validate noncoding functional noncoding regulatory elements and variants in neuronal cells. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that noncoding variation contributes to psychiatric disorders by directly altering the function of regulatory elements in the brain. The motivation for the proposed study is that identifying regulatory mechanisms of psychiatric disorders has the potential to translate into improved diagnosis and treatment. Powered by a team with strong interdisciplinary expertise in psychiatric disorders, functional genomics, technology development, and statistical genetics, this hypothesis will be tested by completing three specific aims: 1) Comprehensive integration of diverse data types to generate hypotheses that “connect” psychiatric genetic results to specific genes; 2) perform high-throughput CRISPR epigenome editing screens to test Aim 1 hypotheses in a natural biological context; 3) Develop mechanistic understanding and validate functional noncoding SCZ risk variants using TF binding assays and iPS-derived neurons from SCZ cases with high genetic risk scores. Our approach is innovative because it uses a highly complementary and diverse set of experimental approaches to drive targeted genetic and functional investigation into regulatory mechanisms relevant for SCZ. In doing so, the proposed research provides a much-needed path forward to understand how noncoding variation contributes to complex human phenotypes. Project Narrative / Relevance Genetic research for psychiatric disorders has achieved remarkable advances in narrowing down regions of the genome that increase risk. However, the exact mechanism for why certain individuals are at higher risk than others remains unknown. The goal of this grant is to identify, characterize, and validate functional noncoding mutations that contribute to schizophrenia. Understanding how specific DNA variants directly contribute to psychiatric disorders will be critical for developing improved diagnostics and treatment therapies.",Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia,10115982,R01MH125236,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Awareness', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organoids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Solid', 'Sweden', 'Synapses', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain volume', 'cell type', 'disorder risk', 'diverse data', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'excitatory neuron', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mind control', 'mouse model', 'nerve stem cell', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'risk variant', 'schizophrenia risk', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'technology development', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1653935
"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased. This project will provide that high-resolution view.",Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes,10078275,R01GM125722,"['Antibodies', 'Bar Codes', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-protein crosslink', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Event', 'Formaldehyde', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Health', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'K-562', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Uncertainty', 'billboard', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'crosslink', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'organizational structure', 'promoter', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'syntax', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2021,453058
"Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries PROJECT SUMMARY Short sequence elements in DNA and RNA determine the levels and composition of mRNAs and proteins, making it critical that we can accurately model how any given sequence will affect transcription, splicing or translation. Such models of cis-regulation will fill in gaps in our knowledge of these core gene expression processes. Additionally, as large numbers of human genomes are sequenced, the ability to predict the effects of sequence variation on the ultimate levels of proteins will be integral to the interpretation of variation in regulatory sequences. Similarly, the construction of metabolic pathways with defined levels of expression and the engineering of synthetic gene networks require accurate knowledge of how regulatory sequences affect expression. This application seeks to use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case for learning how any short regulatory sequence affects protein levels. A predictive model will be trained on a set of libraries two orders of magnitude more complex than have been characterized to date. Libraries will be generated of a growth reporter gene with a million random sequences of 50 nucleotides that comprise either a DNA element that regulates transcription or an RNA element that regulates splicing or translation. The libraries will be transformed into yeast, and the yeast will be placed under selection such that they grow according to the ability of each random sequence to contribute to protein expression. A convolution neural network approach will be used to learn the relationship between these “fitness” phenotypes and their associated genotypes. Although yeast is a single-celled eukaryote, it has been the source of most of the original findings on gene expression, and these findings form the basis for much of our knowledge of more complex eukaryotes. Furthermore, the short sequences in yeast that comprise the DNA- and RNA-binding sites of regulatory proteins tend to be comparable in size to those of other organisms. Yeast is used often in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and the work proposed here will result in novel tools for quantitatively controlling its gene expression. Initial results with a library of 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) indicate that we can construct a model to account for a large fraction of the observed variability in expression, and that the model extends to native sequence elements. The model allowed us to forward engineer 5' UTRs to have increased activity. Specific aims of this application are to assess the effects of random sequences targeted to upstream regulatory elements, core promoter elements, 5' UTRs, introns and 3' UTRs; to learn predictive and interpretable models using convolutional neural networks and to identify novel functional cis-regulatory elements; and to validate our models on native sequences and combinatorial libraries, and by engineering synthetic sequence elements with user-specified properties. In sum, the proposal seeks to construct a comprehensive and predictive model of regulatory sequence–function relationships for a well-studied single- celled eukaryote, providing a basis for similar studies on other organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research seeks to generate a model for how regulatory sequences present in the genome of a simple organism affect the expression of a protein. These studies will be important for ultimately understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease. The results will also improve the ability to engineer metabolic pathways to produce a protein, chemical, drug or other compound.",Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries,10172925,R01GM125809,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eukaryota', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Process', 'Gene Library', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sum', 'Synthetic Genes', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fitness', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'human disease', 'improved', 'member', 'metabolic engineering', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'protein expression', 'scale up', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,350902
"New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Cellular state transitions (i.e. from pluripotent to committed, replicative to quiescent, etc.) require the  coordinated regulation of thousands of genes. Therapeutically harnessing these transitions holds great  promise for human health;; for instance, autologous stem cell therapy has been successfully used in  regenerative medicine and cancer treatments, among others. While some of the key regulatory switches are  known, the field lacks a systems-­level understanding of the genomic circuits that control these transitions,  information that is critical for informed clinical intervention. Here, we will develop an integrated computational  framework to identify core gene regulatory circuits from large gene networks and predict their dynamics and  regulatory functions without the need of detailed network kinetic parameters. Advances in genomics profiling  technology have enabled the mapping of gene regulatory networks, thus we now have the capacity to identify  combinatorial interactions among genes and the master regulators of state transitions. Some systems biology  approaches have simulated the dynamics of a gene regulatory circuit, but traditional methods suffer from two  key issues. First, there is no rational rule to choose an appropriate set of regulator genes in a large network to  model. Second, since it is hard to directly measure most network kinetic parameters from experiment,  modeling results are based on a set of guessed parameters that can be less than optimal, limiting the  application of mathematical modeling to large systems and the prediction power of systems biology. To  address these issues, we recently developed algorithm named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE). RACIPE  generates an ensemble of circuit models, each of which corresponds to a distinct set of random kinetic  parameters, and uniquely identifies robust features, such as clusters of stable gene expression states, by  statistical analysis. We will further enhance RACIPE algorithms for large systems and new data analysis tools  using machine learning. This approach will convert a traditional nonlinear dynamics problem into a data  analysis problem, an essential step for extending the application of gene circuit modeling to large systems. It  also provides a novel strategy to integrate top-­down genomics approaches with bottom-­up mathematical  modeling. The algorithms will be tested and refined using literature-­based gene networks, public genomics  data, and data from collaboration, with a focus on cell differentiation in developmental processes and state  transitions in oncogenesis. Success of the project will result in a comprehensive toolkit that will unveil the gene  regulatory mechanism of cellular decision-­making in any cell of interest. The algorithmic development is   expected to have a broad impact on not only basic research in systems biology but also shed light on  therapeutic intervention in genomic medicine.      RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  Most human complex diseases are multigenic, but our understanding of the interactions between genes in  healthy states and how they are disrupted in disease states is lacking. Computational algorithms will be  designed to construct and model gene regulatory circuits of higher complexity to fill an important gap in our  understanding of the maintenance and transitions among cellular states and their abnormal behavior in  disease. In this proposal, we will develop a suite of systems-­biology tools to extend gene circuit modeling to  large systems and integrate genomics data relevant to fundamental cell biology, cancer, and other human  diseases.   ",New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits,10268260,R35GM128717,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autologous', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Public Health', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'novel strategies', 'stem cell therapy', 'success', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,392500
"Discovery of diabetes-relevant ÃÂ² cell enhancers through 4D enhancer mapping, integrative analysis, and large-scale CRISPRi perturbation screens ABSTRACT  Enhancers are essential regulatory elements that together with transcription factors (TFs) instruct cell- type specific transcriptional programs during development, tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Initiatives such as the ENCODE project, revealed tens of thousands putative enhancers based on linear proximity, using criteria like chromatin accessibility, TF binding, and histone modifications such as H3K27ac. However, a main challenge of uncovering functional enhancers and assigning them to target genes lies in the complexity of the 3D chromatin organization, which can influence enhancer specificity and activity. Using an advanced chromosome conformation capture assay, we recently captured the dynamic rewiring of 3D enhancer networks during mouse somatic cell reprogramming and discovered multi-connected enhancers that we named “3D enhancer hubs”. Here we extend the 3D mapping approach to human primary islets, and compare islets from healthy and type 2 diabetes (T2D) donors to assemble a 4D atlas to capture the rewiring of 3D enhancer network in disease progression. At the same time, we plan to compare the enhancer network in adult islets to earlier stages of development by using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to generate early β cells and their developmental precursors. Utilizing these 4D genomic data, we will computationally nominate core β-cell specific enhancers relevant to β cell development, function, and T2D, and then interrogate these putative enhancers through large-scale CRISPRi mediated perturbation screens using hPSC-β cells. Enhancers identified from the screening effort will be further validated in an established human β cell line and primary human islet β cells. This proposal addresses a critical gap in the 4DN initiative, that is how to translate 3D genomics data into functional data with respect to gene expression in the context of human health. Successful completion of our aims will establish a paradigm for the discovery and interrogation of functional enhancers that instruct transcriptional programs specific to a cell type of interest, reveal unique insights into their mechanisms of action, and identify enhancers with relevance to human development and disease. For instance, uncovering functional enhancers could assist the identification of noncoding causal variants identified in genome-wide association studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE)  This project will take an integrative approach involving generating a 4D atlas of regulatory interactions during both development and disease progressions, computationally nominating diabetes-relevant β cell enhancers through integrative analysis and discovering functional enhancers through large-scale perturbation screens. Knowledge gained from the study will provide a conceptual framework for dissecting gene regulatory networks that instruct the β cell fate and function during development and in diabetic conditions.","Discovery of diabetes-relevant ÃÂ² cell enhancers through 4D enhancer mapping, integrative analysis, and large-scale CRISPRi perturbation screens",10264095,U01DK128852,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Atlases', 'B-Cell Development', 'Beta Cell', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'CRISPR interference', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Ensure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hi-C', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Human Genetics', 'Islet Cell', 'Islets of Langerhans', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural regeneration', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Somatic Cell', 'Specificity', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'clinical application', 'diabetes pathogenesis', 'diabetic', 'gene function', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'islet', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'precursor cell', 'programs', 'promoter', 'screening', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2021,698106
"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,10226063,R35GM128938,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Distal', 'Experimental Designs', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'graph theory', 'histone modification', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'statistics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2021,449649
"Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human biology and disease. High throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) is making it possible to survey the expressed genes and their alternative splicing variations in a wide variety of cellular conditions. However, the short reads are challenging to analyze, demanding highly sophisticated computational methods that can extract meaningful AS information efficiently, accurately, and in a comprehensive way.

"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms.

"Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation How do changes in DNA sequence impact organismal properties? This is a central question of modern  biology, and insights into it can help us understand, among other things, why patients respond  differently to the same treatment, or why some species exhibit behavioral properties not seen in  other species. A major hurdle in solving this ‘genotype-to-phenotype’ problem is our poor knowledge  of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypes and cellular processes, and how those  mechanisms are encoded in DNA. It also leads to severe difficulties in prioritizing  phenotype-linked non-coding variants (polymorphisms) for further investigation. Driven by these  challenges, my lab seeks to develop quantitative frameworks for describing and  discovering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have made significant progress towards this  goal in two main directions: (1) We have developed detailed biophysical models of the  cis-regulatory encoding of gene expression. Using these models we have shown how the regulatory  function of transcription factor (TF) binding sites depends on their sequence and DNA shape, as  well as their ‘trans-context’, e.g., cellular concentrations of regulators, and  ‘cis-context’, e.g., proximity to other TF binding sites and chromatin states. (2) We have  devised statistical models to discover TF-gene interactions from transcriptomic data, as well as  other types of ‘omics’ data if available. Working closely with biologists, we have applied these  models to understand phenotypes such as cytotoxic drug response in cell lines, behavioral response  to social encounters, and embryonic development. Building on the strong foundations of our  past work, I propose to establish a research program that studies transcriptional regulation  holistically at the cis- and trans- levels. Our new pursuits will include: (1) use of our  computational, sequence-level models to describe two data-rich mammalian regulatory programs, an  experimental collaboration to dissect the cis-regulatory logic of a key inflammation gene using  massively parallel reporter assays, and major advances in our modeling techniques; (2) new  machine learning methods for reconstructing networks of TF-gene interactions that explain  phenotypic differences, integration of cis- and trans-regulatory evidence from multi-omics  data, and collaborations to apply these methods in cancer pharmacogenomics and behavioral  neurogenomics; (3) a new probabilistic framework to combine traditional statistical scores of a  non-coding variant with quantitative predictions of its regulatory impact based on the  above-mentioned techniques. Explorations of new forms of synergy among these related goals of  network reconstruction, cis-regulatory sequence modeling and variant interpretation will be woven  throughout our research program. The proposed work will answer fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms underlying  phenotypic differences between individuals, such as why different patients respond differently to  the same drug. We will develop new computational methods for discovery of such mechanisms from a  variety of genomics data sets. We will work closely with experimental biologists and use our tools  to study important biological topics including cancer drug response, inflammation, and effect of  estrogen on breast cancer.","Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation",10267176,R35GM131819,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytotoxic agent', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Embryonic Development', 'Estrogens', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'biophysical model', 'gene interaction', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neurogenomics', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'social', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2021,356979
"Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays an essential role in genome stability, gene regulation, and many diseases, including cancer. The recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and its variants provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate higher-order chromatin organization. Despite the rapidly accumulating resources for investigating 3D genome organization, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of the genome organization remain largely incomplete. Hi-C analyses and 3D genome research are still in their early stage and face several challenges. First, high-resolution chromatin contact maps require extremely deep sequencing and hence have been achieved only for a few cell lines. Second, it is computationally challenging to complement 3D genome structure with one-dimensional (1D) genomic and epigenomic features. Third, recent studies have just begun to infer associations between chromatin interactions and genetic variants and to identify potential target genes of those variants at the genome-wide scale. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term research goal is to develop innovative computational and statistical methods to uncover the interplay between 3D genome structure and function. Speciﬁcally, in the next ﬁve years, I will i) develop computational approaches to enhance the resolution of existing Hi-C data and investigate ﬁne-scale 3D genome architecture as well as its spatiotemporal dynamics and ii) build scalable and interpretable machine learning models that leverage 1D epigenomic data to predict cell type-speciﬁc 3D chromatin interactions and gene expression and elucidate the function of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and human diseases. The completion of the proposed work will deepen our knowledge of 3D genome architecture as well as its functions in gene regulation and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching mission of my research is to understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene regulation.

"Systems Biology of Shape and Size Regulation Abstract The molecular regulation of body shape and size during development and regeneration involves numerous pathways precisely integrated together with the biophysical properties of cellular and tissue dynamics, a complex process poorly understood at the level of whole animals. The overall goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the genetic regulation and coordination of large-scale tissue growth by developing and applying a novel integrated systems biology approach. Combining in vivo experiments and their morphological formalization with machine learning of mathematical biophysical models, we will discern the molecular mechanisms that control growth, shape, and size regulation. We will leverage the robustness of the planarian worm to address the molecular and physical mechanisms regulating their extraordinary homeostatic and regenerative capacity to grow, degrow, and regenerate their whole-body shapes and organs from almost any amputation and across one order of magnitude in sizes. This work will develop novel computational systems biology methods and integrate them with whole-body gene expression imaging and surgical and genetic manipulations assays to elucidate the molecular regulators of body shape and size. Morphological, genetic, and surgical data will be formalized with novel mathematical ontologies, which will serve as input to new machine learning methods able to infer mechanistic gene regulatory networks. The regulatory networks will be quantitatively modeled with a novel mathematical continuous approach for whole-body biophysical simulation, including tissue growth, adhesion molecules, and gene regulation. This computational framework combining machine learning with biophysical modeling will be able to discover the mechanisms of growth and shape regulation from large formalized experimental datasets. Novel genetic interactions will be discovered by the machine learning methodology, which predictions in terms of morphological and gene expression outcomes resulting from genetic and surgical manipulations will be validated at the bench via RNAi and in situ hybridization assays. Integrating machine learning, biophysical mathematical modeling, ontological formalizations, and in vivo surgical and molecular assays represents a comprehensive systems biology approach for elucidating the regulation of shape and size. This work will provide a mechanistic understanding of the diverse genetic pathways that regulate tissue growth dynamics and how they interact precisely between them and with tissue biophysics to create and maintain whole-body scale targeted shapes and sizes. This work will pave the way for new applications and novel therapies in human developmental, regenerative, and cancer medicine. Project Narrative The genetic regulation of the shape and size of internal organs and whole body is crucial during development, regeneration, and homeostasis.

"Advanced algorithms to infer and analyze 3D genome structures Project Summary For the past decade, the population-cell Hi-C technique has significantly improved our ability to discover genome-wide DNA proximities. However, because population Hi-C is based on a pool of cells, it will not help us reveal each single cell's 3D genome structure or understand cell-to-cell variability in terms of 3D genome structure and gene regulation. It is also difficult to achieve a high resolution, such as 1 Kbp, with population Hi- C; therefore, when finding and analyzing the spatial interactions for the promoter or enhancer regions typically associated with biologically-important regulatory elements, population Hi-C data's resolution is too low to be useful. Moreover, while we know that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a key role in the formation of genome 3D structures, the question is whether long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the process since lncRNAs have been found to recruit proteins needed for chromatin remodeling, and our preliminary research has found that lncRNA LINC00346 directly interacts with CTCF. Finally, while members of the bioinformatics community, including the PI, have developed many algorithms to reconstruct 3D genome structures based on population Hi-C data, important questions still must be answered regarding how 3D genome structures are involved in gene regulation and whether there are relationships between 3D genome structures and genetic and epigenetic features. The PI proposes to conduct leading research to overcome these challenges and address these questions. During the next five years, the PI will develop algorithms to reconstruct the 3D whole- genome structures for single cells and analyze cell-to-cell variabilities in terms of 3D genome structure and gene regulation. The PI will develop a deep learning algorithm to enhance the resolution of population Hi-C data to that of Capture Hi-C data (1 Kbp) so that we can make good use of the large amount of Hi-C data accumulated in the past decade. An online database will be built to allow the community to access both population and single-cell 3D genome structures in an integrated way. The PI will work with a cancer biologist to discover any lncRNAs that function as a scaffold to fine-tune the CTCF-cohesin protein complex, as well as two neuron scientists to develop a more complete understanding of gene regulation while considering 3D genome and other genetic and epigenetic features. Given the PI's track record and productivity, having three computational goals and two collaborative goals is not only feasible but computationally and biologically rewarding. In five years, once the proposed studies are accomplished, the PI should have established a uniquely independent place in the field of 3D genome, maintaining leading positions in inferring single-cell 3D genome structures, enhancing Hi-C data resolution, and building 3D genome databases, while establishing similar positions in reconstructing high-resolution 3D genome structures, finding lncRNAs' roles in the formation of genome structures, and understanding how 3D genome structures are involved in gene regulation. Project Narrative The three-dimensional (3D) structure of genome is critically important for gene regulation; and the abnormal 3D genome structures are often associated with diseases such as cancer. This proposal aims to reconstruct and analyze the 3D genome structures of thousands of individual cells, study how 3D genome structures participate in gene regulation, determine whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the formation of genome structures, and build an online knowledge base integrating 3D genome structures with other biological information.",Advanced algorithms to infer and analyze 3D genome structures,10237362,R35GM137974,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hi-C', 'Individual', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Neurons', 'Other Genetics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'base', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cohesin', 'deep learning algorithm', 'genome database', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'promoter', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'scaffold', 'three dimensional structure', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R35,2021,366706
"Unlocking sequence-structure-function-disease relationships in large protein super-families Project Summary Predicting disease phenotypes from genotypes is a grand challenge in biology and personalized medicine. Our long-term goal is to address this challenge using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Working towards this goal, we have developed and deployed a powerful evolutionary systems approach to map the complex relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in biomedically important protein super-families such as protein kinases. We have made important contributions describing the unique modes of allosteric regulation in various protein kinases, deciphering the structural basis of oncogenic activation in a subset of receptor tyrosine kinases, uncovering the regulation of pseudokinases, and developing new tools and resources for addressing data integration challenges in the signaling field. We propose to build on these impactful studies to answer key questions emanating from our ongoing studies such as: What are the functions of pseudokinases, the catalytically-inert members of the kinome, and how can we use pseudokinases to better predict and characterize non-catalytic functions of kinases? What are the functions of conserved cysteine residues in regulatory sites of protein and small molecule kinases and are they post-translationally modified in redox signaling and oxidative stress response that are causally associated with age-related disorders? How can we enhance existing computational models for predicting genome-phenome relationships using structural information, and can machine learning on structurally enhanced knowledge graphs reveal new relationships between patient-derived mutations and disease phenotypes? We propose to answer these questions using a variety of approaches including statistical mining of large sequence datasets, molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, mass spectrometry, biochemical analysis and in vivo assays. Completion of this work is expected to reveal new allosteric sites for targeting pseudokinase and kinase non-catalytic functions in diseases, and significantly advance our understanding of kinase regulatory mechanisms in disease and normal states. Our work will create new tools and resources for knowledge graph mining and provide explainable models for inferring causal relationships linking genomes and phenomes with potential applications in personalized medicine. Finally, the scope and impact of our work will be significantly broadened by participation in studies extending our specialized tools and technological approaches developed for the study of kinases to other biomedically important gene families such as glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases. Project Narrative Many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders are causally associated with abnormal protein kinase and glycosyltransferase functions. By characterizing the regulatory functions of these proteins in disease and normal states and by developing new tools to predict disease phenotypes from genotypes, the proposed studies will accelerate the targeting of these proteins for drug discovery and personalized medicine.",Unlocking sequence-structure-function-disease relationships in large protein super-families,10086608,R35GM139656,"['Address', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Allosteric Site', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cysteine', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Inflammatory', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenic', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patients', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Work', 'age related', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'broadening participation research', 'data integration', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'glycosyltransferase', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'knowledge graph', 'member', 'molecular dynamics', 'personalized medicine', 'phenome', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'small molecule', 'sulfotransferase', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R35,2021,357769
"Understanding the regulation and impact of transposable elements in Vertebrate health and disease Project summary  The overarching goal of my lab is to understand understudied mechanisms of genomic regulation, and how they influence lifelong Vertebrate health and disease. In multi-cellular organisms, diverse cell types are characterized by specific genomic regulation patterns, and the precise control of these patterns is key not only for development, but also for cell/tissue homeostasis in adults. Indeed, loss of fine control in genomic regulation has been linked to disease (e.g. cancer, neurodegeneration) and age-related functional decline. An interesting and understudied family of genomic elements lies in dormant genetic parasites (e.g. transposons, also called “jumping genes”). Although transposons can represent up to 80% of some eukaryotic genomes, they remain critically understudied, since they were historically dismissed as unimportant (i.e. “junk DNA”), and their high copy numbers and repetitive nature pose unique technical challenges. Consistent with their potential impact in health and disease, the ability of cells to suppress transposon activity is disrupted with disease and with aging. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that many aspects of biology and genomic regulation differ between males and females, including emerging data suggesting potential sex-dimorphism in transposon activity. However, how transposable elements are regulated throughout life in healthy somatic tissues and across biological sexes, and how they influence vertebrate health, remains largely unknown. Thus, we propose to decipher how transposons are controlled in healthy somatic cells (including in male vs. female cells), and how loss of that control could influence Vertebrate health and disease. To explore this question, my group will use a unique combination of ‘omics’ approaches, machine-learning, and experimental validation in animal models. We use two vertebrate models for their respective strengths: the laboratory mouse (e.g. powerful genetics, validated antibodies, etc.) and the African turquoise killifish, a naturally short-lived model organism I have helped develop (e.g. short generation time/lifespan, strain diversity, cost-effectiveness, etc.). First, we will decipher sex-dimorphic regulation of transposon activity, determining the impact of gonadal hormones vs. sex- chromosomes on such regulation. Second, we will use functional genomics to identify new regulators of transposon activity in somatic cells. Finally, we will evaluate the impact of transposon control in key somatic tissues and across sexes on lifelong vertebrate health using the naturally short-lived African turquoise killifish as a model. Ultimately, understanding the fine control of transposon in healthy cells will help devise strategies to prevent their misregulation in disease, by allowing us to maintain youthful and healthy genomic regulation landscapes. 1 Project narrative  Disruption of genomic regulation is accompanied by striking functional changes across cell types and species. However, how mobile genetic elements are regulated throughout life, across biological sexes, and how they influence physiology in response to external or internal cues, remains largely unknown. By leveraging big data and state-of-the-art experimental approaches on vertebrate models including mouse and the emerging African turquoise killifish, the proposed research program will advance our understanding of mobile genetic element control in healthy somatic cells, and shed light on how these elements can influence vertebrate health and disease. 1",Understanding the regulation and impact of transposable elements in Vertebrate health and disease,10265910,R35GM142395,"['Adult', 'African', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Big Data', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Cues', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Family', 'Female', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Hormones', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Jumping Genes', 'Junk DNA', 'Killifishes', 'Laboratory mice', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mobile Genetic Elements', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sex Chromosomes', 'Somatic Cell', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'age related', 'biological sex', 'cell type', 'cost effectiveness', 'functional decline', 'functional genomics', 'male', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R35,2021,412500
"REDfly: The regulatory sequence resource for Drosophila and other insects We have developed a unique resource, the REDfly (Regulatory Element Database for Fly) database of transcriptional regulatory elements, to provide regulatory annotation for the genome of Drosophila and other insects. The genomic sequences regulating gene expression—transcriptional cis-regulatory modules (CRMs, e.g. “enhancers”) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs)—are not currently curated by any other major database resources. This is a serious deficiency as CRMs play critical roles with respect to birth defects and chronic diseases as well as normal development, phenotypic variation, and evolution. Knowledge of experimentally validated CRMs and TFBSs is vital for many areas of research including interpretation and validation of data developed by large-scale genomics projects, providing training data for machine-learning CRM- discovery methods, genome annotation, modeling gene regulatory networks, studying the evolution of gene regulation, and numerous aspects of the basic biology of transcriptional regulation. Knowledge of insect CRMs is also an important step in developing biotechnology methods for control of insect disease vectors and for eliminating pathogen transmission. REDfly includes experimentally verified CRMs and TFBSs along with their DNA sequence, their associated genes, and the expression patterns they direct. It is the most detailed existing platform for metazoan regulatory element annotation and is widely acknowledged as the premier resource in the regulatory genomics arena. Only REDfly integrates all of the available insect cis-regulatory information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive collection of regulatory elements. The objectives of this proposal are to keep REDfly up to date with the rapidly increasing numbers of CRMs and TFBSs being identified and to update the REDfly site to maximize its utility to the research community. The focus is on: (1) Curation. REDfly will continue to be kept up-to-date as new studies are published, and valuable data and metadata will be added to existing records. (2) User interface. We will develop more sophisticated search, display, and download capabilities to keep pace with the vastly increased amounts and types of data now contained in the database. We will update software components that have become obsolete in the decade since their initial implementation. (3) Data integration. We will increase integration of disparate data types and develop confidence scores for annotations. (4) Workflow. We will increase our curation efficiency and ability through improved workflows. (5) Ontology support. We will improve how we use biomedical ontologies through incorporating the latest ontology- related software, including ontology browsers and SPARQL queries. The proposed activities are significant as they will keep up-to-date a high-value resource for multiple research communities and increase REDfly’s utility by adding needed new features and functions. REDfly has already demonstrated its essential and unique value as an important platform for supporting hypothesis-driven empirical and computational research in multiple research areas. It will have greatly increased impact through the updates and enhancements proposed here. The proposed research is relevant to public health because gene regulatory sequences have been linked to birth defects and both chronic and acute diseases. Knowledge of such sequences in insects is also critical in devising means for insect biocontrol and controlling insect-transmitted pathogens. The REDfly database is of proven value in contributing to our understanding of regulatory sequences by serving as a significant source of raw data for analysis, hypothesis generation, assessment and validation, and empirical research in a wide spectrum of important research areas spanning molecular and developmental biology, genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics.",REDfly: The regulatory sequence resource for Drosophila and other insects,10267371,U24GM142435,"['Acute Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arthropods', 'Attention', 'Binding Sites', 'Biocontrols', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genome', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Elements', 'Empirical Research', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Insect Control', 'Insecta', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Ontology', 'Paper', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'fly', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insect disease vector', 'knowledge base', 'model organisms databases', 'ontology development', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'sex', 'transcription factor', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,U24,2021,471718
"Computational methods to predict gene regulatory network dynamics and cell state transitions Project Summary The goal of this research program is to provide tools for the discovery of transcriptional networks that control cell fate decisions. Cell fate decisions driven by cell state transitions underlie essential cell processes from development to cellular reprogramming. There is an opportunity to make use of publicly available genomic data to develop predictive computational models of cell state transition dynamics. The methods proposed will offer means to gain insight into cell fate decision-making and how it is transcriptionally regulated, given specific cell fate decision points and suitable data. Examples of such decision points include control of epidermal regeneration, or the maintenance of balance among myeloid cell fates during hematopoiesis. In order to bridge the gap between genomics and cell dynamics, statistical and computational modeling challenges must be overcome. Two key challenges form the basis of this research program: 1) developing statistical methods to infer regulatory networks while accounting for the levels of variability between single cells, and 2) developing computational models to couple gene regulatory dynamics within cells and cell-cell communication between cells. To address the first challenge, we will develop machine learning models to predict gene expression dynamics from time-series data. These models will be able to classify genes by their temporal patterns, and the results will inform gene network inference. We will then develop methods for network inference that integrate muti-modal data (single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing) as well as cell-cell signaling information to learn networks that control specific cell state transitions. To address the second challenge, we will develop differential equation-based multiscale models of the gene regulatory network dynamics coupled with the cell- external signaling dynamics. This will allow us to capture both molecular and cellular dynamics in high resolution, and thus identify which parameters exert key control over the system. We will use Bayesian methods for parameter inference to fit models to data and perform model selection, adapting methods where needed for multiscale model inference. Models will be rigorously evaluated through their application to specific systems, including cell differentiation (e.g. myeloid fate decisions during hematopoiesis) and development (e.g. nephron progenitor cell fate decisions). In each of these organ systems, models predictions will be tested experimentally via collaborations. Following iterative testing, open-source, validated methods will be made widely available for the study of the dynamic processes of cell fate decision-making. Project Narrative Cell fate decisions are essential for development and the maintenance of organs throughout life, thus understanding them underlies health challenges ranging from developmental disorders to cancer. This project will develop computational methods using genomic data to study the dynamic gene expression programs that control cell fate decisions. The result will be new tools with which to study dynamic cellular processes in single cells.",Computational methods to predict gene regulatory network dynamics and cell state transitions,10276680,R35GM143019,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Fate Control', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Differential Equation', 'Equilibrium', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Myelogenous', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Natural regeneration', 'Organ', 'Pattern', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'XCL1 gene', 'base', 'body system', 'developmental disease', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'intercellular communication', 'learning network', 'multi-scale modeling', 'nephron progenitor', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'stem cells', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R35,2021,412500
"Sequence models of genome regulatory architecture in 3D Project Summary Interpreting individual genome sequence and the consequence of any sequence variation is critical for the study of the genetic basis of diseases and the path toward precision medicine. Genomic sequence is at the basis of multiple levels of genome regulation which are highly intertwined, including chromatin protein binding, 3D genome architecture, and gene transcription. Decoding these regulatory functions directly from the sequence will provide a computational platform for scalable prediction of variant effects and interrogation of base pair-level sequence functions with “in silico mutagenesis”. Progress has been made in decoding regulatory genomic sequence, including with the development of deep learning sequence models. However, the sequence-basis of complex phenomena such as transcriptional regulation will not be fully resolved without accounting for genome structure and long-range 3D sequence context. Genome structures at multiple spatial scales, including promoter- enhancer interactions, transcriptional condensates, topologically associating domains, chromatin compartments, and nuclear bodies can have strong impacts on transcriptional regulation. With data and techniques that have only now become sufficient to tackle this challenge, we will study these phenomena and trace complex regulatory output back to the basis of sequence dependencies by developing sequence models of 3D genome regulatory architecture. We will develop a computational framework of deep learning sequence models with the capability of modeling multiscale 3D genome interactions and integrating long-range sequence information, for comprehensively interpreting the regulatory functions of genome sequence. The proposed work will open up new possibilities for interpreting and applying structural and transcriptional impacts of sequence variations, including asking how genetic factors, such as large structural variants, affect gene expression through remodeling of genome structural organization in healthy and disease states. Project Narrative The genomic sequence directs its 3D organization and gene regulation which is essential for the normal development and function of the human body. Genome variations across individuals may disrupt structural and gene regulations and contribute to susceptibility to diseases and response to therapeutics, yet the consequences of genome variations are generally unknown. Computational models proposed in this project will decode the structural and transcriptional impact of any genome sequence and open up new possibilities in assessing the impacts of genome variants and understanding their roles in disease genetics.",Sequence models of genome regulatory architecture in 3D,10242561,DP2GM146336,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding Proteins', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nuclear', 'Output', 'Predisposition', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'chromatin protein', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'in silico', 'multi-scale modeling', 'organizational structure', 'precision medicine', 'promoter', 'response', 'sequence learning', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIGMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DP2,2021,1476000
"Genetic regulation of atrial gene expression in development and disease SUMMARY  Precise regulation of atrial gene expression is crucial to maintain atrial homeostasis, and disorders or gene mutations that impact atrial gene expression can cause atrial fibrillation (AF), a serious arrhythmia that affects an estimated 33 million people worldwide. However, there remain many gaps in our understanding of atrial gene regulation, including the mechanisms that underlie chamber-selective gene expression. Human genetic studies have shown that sequence variants near the cardiac transcription factor gene TBX5 are associated with greater AF risk, and mice with Tbx5 deficiency develop AF. Although recent work has identified some TBX5-regulated genes that contribute to AF susceptibility, the atrial TBX5-centered transcriptional network is incompletely explored. Elucidation of this network and its sensitivity to TBX5 dose would reveal nodal points in AF pathogenesis and may suggest new approaches to prevent or treat AF. The overarching goal of this re- search proposal is to elucidate the atrial gene regulatory network and how it is perturbed in AF. The proposal buillds on novel reagents and techniques developed in the Pu lab to interrogate transcriptional mechanisms in vivo, including highly sensitive and reproducible cardiac transcription factor ChIP-seq through in vivo biotinyla- tion (bioChIP-seq), massively parallel in vivo measurement of cis-regulatory element (CRE) activity (AAV- MPRA assay), and mosaic gene inactivation strategies to hone in direct, cell autonomous effects of gene inac- tivation. In Aim 1, we use bioChIP-seq and AAV-MPRA to define atrial CREs and to dissect the sequence fea- tures required for their chamber selective activity. In Aim 2, we determine the effect of TBX5 deficiency on the occupancy of other TFs and p300, the activity of CREs, and the expression of atrial genes. We use these data to define the TBX5-centered atrial gene regulatory network, and to determine how this network is perturbed by TBX5 haploinsufficiency or knockout. In Aim 3, we test the hypothesis, suggested by our preliminary data, that TBX5 regulates atrial genes through functional and physical interaction with TEAD1. Successful completion of this proposal will lead to new insights into atrial gene regulation and its perturbation in AF. NARRATIVE  The heart's upper chambers, the atria, and its lower chambers, the ventricles, contain fundamentally dis- tinct types of muscle cells, and are affected by different types of disease. One common and severe disease specific to the atria is atrial fibrillation, which occurs in over 9% of older individuals. This proposal will investi- gate the mechanisms that maintain atrial muscle cell gene expression, and perturbation of these mechanisms that cause atrial fibrillation, resulting in new insights into the causes of atrial diseases such as atrial fibrillation.",Genetic regulation of atrial gene expression in development and disease,10138240,R01HL156503,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Age-Years', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotinylation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Data', 'Dependovirus', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Dose', 'EP300 gene', 'Enhancers', 'Etiology', 'GATA4 gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Transduction Agent', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Metabolic stress', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mus', 'Muscle Cells', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nodal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Precipitation', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'biochip', 'combinatorial', 'dosage', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'heart function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'muscle enhancer factor-2A', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'organ growth', 'prevent', 'programs', 'stem', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,607338
"Identification of Transposable Element Insertions in the Kids First Data Project Summary Insertion of transposable elements (TEs, sometimes referred to as “jumping genes”) into the human genome can be pathogenic. Our aim in this project is to use sophisticated computational approaches to characterize TE insertions in the whole-genome sequencing data generated in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program and identify any insertional mutations that may disrupt gene function. The large scale of the Kids First program provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the role of TE insertions in childhood cancers and structural birth defects, as well as to create a resource of reference TE maps that will be important for all other TE studies. We will first modify our existing algorithm called xTEA for the trio design of the Kids First studies and increase the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. Then, we will apply it to the thousands of trios that have been profiled in the Kids First program, using a pipeline optimized for the cloud environment. The resulting set of TE insertions (especially L1, Alu, SVA, and HERV insertions) will be curated with all relevant features and be made into a database for the community. We will also apply machine learning methods to improve the calls once a sufficient amount of training data have been obtained. To investigate the potential pathogenicity of the mutation, we will first focus on insertions within genes, but we will also explore those in regulatory elements inferred from epigenetic profiling data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transposable elements, or “jumping genes”, are genetic elements that can alter the DNA of an individual.

"A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition Abstract Drug metabolism and disposition are essential xenobiotic responses. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding RNAs larger than 200 nucleotides (nt) in length and do not have protein-coding potentials. Although many of the biological functions of lncRNAs have been recognized, it is unclear whether and how lncRNAs can regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters and if so, whether the regulations are implicated in cancer chemo-resistance. Through integrative analysis of cancer non-coding genomic and high-through drug screening data of 505 cancer cell lines, our preliminary study have discovered and functionally characterized a group of ADME(drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, whose up-regulation is associated with resistance to more than 100 chemotherapy compounds and may regulate drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters through interacting with xenobiotic nuclear receptor. We hypothesize that dysregulation of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs is an important contributor for the development of cancer chemo-resistance. Mechanistically, ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs. We propose three specific aims to test our hypotheses: In Aim 1, we will perform bioinformatic analysis and molecularly clone of lncRNAs associated with cancer chemo-resistance and clinical prognosis. In Aim 2: we will functional characterize of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, using in vivo and in vitro cancer chemotherapy models. In Aim 3: we will determine the mechanism by which ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Chemotherapy remains a mainstay in the clinical management of cancer patients, but chemo-resistance is a major challenge to overcome. Understanding the novel lncRNA responsive and xenobiotic nuclear receptor- mediated chemo-resistance will help provide novel strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy and avoid the development of chemo-resistance. Narrative The goal of this study is to reveal a novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition. Specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that a group of novel lncRNAs, identified by our computational analysis and experimental validation, can affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs.
