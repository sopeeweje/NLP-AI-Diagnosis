"Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Auditory WM dysfunctions are evidenced in individuals with speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as central auditory processing disorders (CAPD). Better understanding of auditory WM would help develop more precise biomarkers and targeted interventions for these deficits. Evidence for neuronal activation related to auditory WM patterns have been found in laboratory animals as well as in non- invasive human neuroimaging studies, both in auditory cortices (AC) and elsewhere in the brain. Recent human fMRI data also provide some evidence on item-specific activation patterns in ACs and frontal cortices. However, exactly where in the brain auditory WM content is stored and, more importantly, how the memorized information is represented is still unclear.  This research program pursues a better understanding of human auditory WM by attempting to infer its contents from the brain: Using state-of-the-art non-invasive neuroimaging and advanced signal-analysis methods we will search for cortical activation patterns that would predict item-specific WM information. We will examine brain function non-invasively with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional MRI (fMRI), and validate the findings using intracranial EEG (iEEG) measurements in presurgical patients. Recent studies suggest that, instead of persistent activation patterns, WM is supported by short-term synaptic facilitation, i.e., ""activity-silent"" population-level mechanisms. We hypothesize that these activity-silent representations could be decoded by analyzing the aftereffects of generic auditory ""impulse stimuli"" or TMS, which are utilized to ""ping"" the underlying cortical network during memory maintenance. We also hypothesize that although auditory WM likely involves co-operation of multiple brain regions, which are involved in articulatory-motor functions, perceptual categorization, or semantic processing, the retention of auditory-sensory attributes such as spectrotemporal modulation patterns critically depends on ACs. To examine WM of such auditory attributes, we will use tasks with dynamic ripple sound stimuli, which are spectrotemporally similar to human vocalizations but resist non-auditory processing strategies.  The major significance of this project is that it will increase the understanding of auditory WM, a crucial cognitive function whose neuronal bases have remained elusive. The results may also help develop more precise tools for characterizing auditory WM dysfunctions in hearing and communication deficits as well as in disorders such as dyslexia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Our research program pursues a better theoretical understanding of this crucial cognitive function using advanced multimodal neuroimaging methods, validated using intracranial recordings in pre-surgical patients. Our results may also help develop more precise tools for characterizing auditory WM dysfunctions in speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia.",Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity,10105316,R01DC016915,"['Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual Disorders', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Problem Solving', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cortex mapping', 'electric field', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'operation', 'programs', 'semantic processing', 'sound', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,599963
"Network encoding of short-term memory in primary auditory cortex Project Summary/Abstract  Short-term memory (STM) is a fundamental component of hearing that is critical to speech comprehension and auditory communication. Mounting evidence has indicated that the activity in primary auditory cortex (A1) changes when we perform auditory tasks. In this project, our long-term objective is to understand how A1 changes its neural activity and connectivity during the maintenance of auditory STM.  We will study how auditory STM is encoded in the structure of neural networks in A1 layer 2/3 (L2/3). We choose to study L2/3 because auditory STM involves an intracortical circuit, and L2/3 is dense in intracortical connectivity. To the best of our knowledge, the representation of STM in neural network structure has not been studied in A1. To explore this topic, we will have animals compare two sequential sounds that are separated by a silent delay. The animals must memorize the first sound to compare with the second sound to give a correct behavioral response during the task. We will record neuronal responses in A1 L2/3 while the animals perform this task. We hypothesize that the neural networks that arise during the first sound will be sustained during the delay until the second sound. We will use both simple and complex sounds to understand how acoustic complexity affects neuronal network structure. Furthermore, we will determine if there exists a stimulus-invariant representation of acoustic periodicity, i.e., `pitch', in neuronal networks. Our preliminary results suggest that neural activity in auditory cortex depends on if the animal successfully discriminates between high vs. low frequency pure-tones. Thus, our results shed light on how the brain's auditory responsiveness depends on how we listen and react to sound.  Listening can be challenging for both healthy and hearing-impaired people. Our studies will help clarify the basic understanding of how the brain allows us to listen. As a result, our work will contribute to future therapies designed to enable better hearing in every-day settings. Project Narrative  Short-term memory allows us to find meaning in sequences of sound, like phonemes in speech or notes in a melody, by briefly storing auditory information in the brain while we are listening. Here, we will record from the brains of mice while they perform auditory tasks that require short-term memory. Our studies will shed light on how neuronal networks in the brain encode our perceptions and memories of sound.",Network encoding of short-term memory in primary auditory cortex,10142438,R21DC017829,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Decision Making', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Maintenance', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Music', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pitch Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Training', 'Work', 'awake', 'behavioral response', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'graph theory', 'hearing impairment', 'information organization', 'neural network', 'normal hearing', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'therapy design', 'two-photon']",NIDCD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2021,154500
"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,10171740,R00AG054732,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Arousal', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Comparative Study', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Dopamine', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Foundations', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Norepinephrine', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Psychological Theory', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'comparative', 'emerging adult', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'information processing', 'lens', 'neural network', 'psychobiology', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'visual information', 'young adult']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2021,247426
"Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease The entorhinal cortex (EC) is long known to be the region affected first in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with symptoms such as disorientation, confusion and inability to navigate appearing early in life. But more recently, a region in the brainstem- locus coeruleus (LC) was found to have tau accumulation in young healthy adults, making it the first region in the brain with AD pathology. The LC is known to be important for arousal and controls the sleep/wake switch. The neurons of LC project to several regions including EC and hippocampus which are known to be important for spatial memory. Unsurprisingly, one of the earliest symptoms of AD is spatial difficulties and it is possible that early pathology in LC affects sleep leading to spatial memory deficits. With both LC and EC important for memory, we aim to identify which of them is more vulnerable to tau and Aβ pathology. To explore this possibility, we will first inject LC and EC regions of wildtype mouse with pathological tau derived from human AD brains to make them dysfunctional, and evaluate their neuronal function. We will also assess sleep and test memory performance in relevant behavior tasks. To understand how aβ affects tau pathology, we will inject human tau in the APP Knock-In mice which has physiological amounts of APP expressed in them. We will determine if Aβ together with tau worsens the neuronal function of LC and EC neurons and it sleep and memory is impaired further. We will use multi-region silicon probes to simultaneously record activity from LC or medial EC and hippocampal neurons. The MEC and hippocampal neurons are well characterized with properties that can be easily measured using spatial navigation tasks. We will make use of virtual reality head-fixed setup for the animals to navigate in, and allowing us to quickly test animal’s memory in any context and environment. The animals will be tested for object-location memory and context-dependent memory in virtual environment. We will use machine learning algorithms to decode animal’s position in the LC, MEC and HPC neural data and determine if it is affected by tau or Aβ or both. We will also assess sleep parameters and correlate with memory. We hypothesize that tau in LC and EC will make its neurons dysfunctional and directly affect sleep and memory, and this in concert with Aβ will exacerbate neuronal dysfunction leading to increased sleep problems and spatial memory impairment as seen in early AD. With this we aim to identify electrophysiological biomarker of neuronal dysfunction before the onset of behavioral troubles. We will test if increasing the neuronal firing in hypoactive neurons and reducing the firing in hyperactive neurons will restore downstream neuronal dysfunction and reverse sleep problems and cognitive impairment. The proposal brings together diverse fields (neuroscience, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical and predictive tests to interrogate function in vulnerable brain regions that are dysfunctional in AD. The locus coeruleus and the entorhinal cortex region of the brain are among the first to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, causing sleep problems and cognitive dysfunction. Using multi-region recording probes we will evaluate their function to determine which one of them is more vulnerable to tau and aβ pathology. We will test if by using optogenetic approach the neurons in these regions can be rescued and cognitive deficits be reversed.",Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease,10142333,R01AG064066,"['20 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Disorientation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home', 'Human', 'Hyperactivity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mus', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'computational neuroscience', 'entorhinal cortex', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'neuron loss', 'non rapid eye movement', 'optogenetics', 'predictive test', 'rapid eye movement', 'relating to nervous system', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep regulation', 'spatial memory', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'virtual environment', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'way finding']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,622966
"Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage Project Summary / Abstract In the hours after learning, the activation of gene expression follows a specific pattern, producing transient waves of expression needed for long-term memory consolidation. These changes require non-genetic (i.e., “epigenetic”) events, including modifications to: DNA-organizing proteins known as histones, the DNA itself, and the accessibility of DNA to proteins. Additionally, the molecular changes necessary for memory require a form of RNA-based regulation. In the absence of such changes, the long-lasting regulation of gene expression during memory storage fails, and this could account for defects in memory that accompany many psychiatric disorders. Our long-term goal is to define novel epigenetic mechanisms underlying memory storage and synaptic plasticity by taking advantage of recent advances in our understanding of histone modifications, in the development of single-cell RNA technology, and in the function of regulatory mechanisms mediated by small noncoding RNAs. During the previous funding period, we defined a novel metabolic source of acetyl-CoA in the nucleus and have obtained preliminary data about new forms of histone acylation and crotonylation associated with spatial learning. We also developed bioinformatic tools to analyze single nuclear RNA sequencing data to identify neurons activated by learning. We further established the reversal of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated mRNA silencing as a novel epigenetic means of regulating activity-dependent translation, linking synaptic activity to translational upregulation of key memory-related targets. These major findings provide the basis of our proposed experiments that we believe will define the next frontiers in our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms of memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the impact of a novel histone modification, histone crotonylation, on the epigenetic landscape and gene expression during memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 2, we will define cell type-specific transcriptional signatures of the hippocampal neurons during memory consolidation and retrieval. In Specific Aim 3, we will elucidate the microRNA- dependent mechanisms that regulate long-term memory and synaptic plasticity driven by a microRNA processing complex. An understanding of these key epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved in the consolidation and storage of long-term memories is expected to ultimately lead to the development of new treatments for the debilitating cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Project Narrative The regulation of specific genes critical to the storage of memories (“memory consolidation”) and changes in neuronal function (“plasticity”) vital for learning are controlled by a number of mechanisms that are not themselves regulated by genetics. We propose to determine the functional roles of such epigenetic processes in memory consolidation and plasticity, and to define the sets of genes that are activated, in individual cells, during memory consolidation. This research promises to provide information that will be critical to the development of novel therapeutics capable of alleviating the cognitive deficits underlying many psychiatric disorders.",Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage,10211384,R01MH087463,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Acetylation', 'Acyl Coenzyme A', 'Acylation', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Coenzyme A', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Histones', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear RNA', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Ribonucleases', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Derepression', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translational Repression', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'long term memory', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,740506
"Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning Learning is how organisms adapt to changes in their environment and involves the coordination of neural systems mediating cognition, emotion, and motor control. The major goal of the proposed research program is to elucidate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems during associative learning. Interactions between these neural systems are particularly important because the context and emotional significance of stimuli provide essential information for acquisition and performance of motor responses. The breakdown of interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems in various neurological disorders can therefore have devastating consequences for learned behaviors. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and cerebellum play significant roles in cognition, emotional responses, and motor learning, respectively. The proposed research program constitutes a comprehensive analysis of cerebellar interactions with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during associative motor learning. Our general conceptual framework is that the cerebellum receives inputs from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex via the pons regarding which stimuli are important and when they occur, and the cerebellum then sends error-driven feedback to these forebrain systems to facilitate learning about important events. This conceptual framework takes into account the bidirectional relationship between the cerebellum and the relevant forebrain systems as well as interactions between forebrain systems. Multi-site electrophysiology, pathway-specific optogenetics, and precise behavioral analyses will be combined to investigate circuit-level interactions between the cerebellum, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex during associative learning and extinction (inhibitory learning) training. The proposed studies would significantly advance understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying cerebellar interactions with the forebrain. This would be a substantial contribution to the field because it has been known that the cerebellum must interact with the forebrain in many contexts that are crucial for everyday life such as learning, memory, planning, control of emotions, and communication, but very little is known mechanistically about how the cerebellum interacts with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Memory deficits are found with many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and following stroke; the breakdown of interactions between memory systems can be particularly debilitating. This proposal examines the neural mechanisms underlying interactions between emotional and motor memory systems during associative learning. Elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying memory system interactions is potentially important for developing treatments for memory deficits.",Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning,10069403,R01NS088567,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Blinking', 'Cerebellum', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Data', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pontine structure', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Prosencephalon', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'granule cell', 'indexing', 'learned behavior', 'learning extinction', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,379571
"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation Project Summary/Abstract One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign—yet annoying—examples of ‘normal’ forgetting, it is also a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have emphasized the critical role of pattern separation in reducing memory interference. Pattern separation involves coding similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for confusion is thereby minimized. While there is general agreement that pattern separation is implemented by the hippocampus—and that pattern separation is important for reducing memory interference—there remain several fundamental gaps in our understanding of how, when, and why pattern separation occurs. In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity—that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation—to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. Project Narrative A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may only represent an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia—groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate— memory confusion and interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting, including in younger and older adults, and will lead to fundamental new insight into how the brain resolves interference between similar memories.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,10123856,R01NS089729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory Disorders', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'age related', 'clinically significant', 'data mining', 'dentate gyrus', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forgetting', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'insight', 'motivated behavior', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,485965
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,10247567,U19NS104648,"['Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'cost effectiveness', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'instrumentation', 'large scale data', 'member', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'social computing', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2021,3062362
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data.

"Computational and Circuit Mechanisms Underlying Rapid Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The mammalian brain has a remarkable ability to store and retrieve information. Detailed memories can be formed after as little as one exposure, and those memories can be retained for decades. This ability is compromised following damage to structures located in the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus and the adjacent cortex. Over the past decade, many studies have highlighted interactions between the hippocampus and neocortex, in particular, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), as having an essential role in memory consolidation. However, the circuit mechanisms that support memory consolidation are not well-understood, particularly in the primate brain. Impaired memory is an important component of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, temporal lobe epilepsy, depression, and schizophrenia that collectively affect over twenty million Americans. Our long-range goal is to contribute to a better understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie memory processes, in order to bring us closer to developing new therapies for these disabled patients. Psychological theories and behavioral studies have suggested that rapid, single-trial accumulation of information is facilitated by prior knowledge, a cognitive map or “mental schema” that provides a framework onto which new information can be assimilated. This concept is relevant for understanding potential hippocampal-neocortical interactions in the service of memory consolidation. The experiments proposed here will directly examine the neural circuits in the hippocampus, PFC, and PPC that support schema development and new learning. The overall goal of this U-19 Program is to develop a comprehensive theory of the circuit mechanisms that support rapid learning. To achieve these goals, we will make use of a multi-laboratory research framework with an ambitious effort that requires multiple areas of expertise, exemplified by our team members. Our team effort is organized around four Research Projects, each supported by Data Science and Administrative Cores. Through parallel projects in monkeys and humans, we will perform large-scale recordings simultaneously across the hippocampus, PFC and PPC to assess modulations in cross-regional connectivity during schema development and new association and categorization learning. Complementary theoretical approaches will integrate large-scale circuit modeling of the human and nonhuman primate brain based on measured mesoscopic connectivity and training recurrent neural networks to perform cognitive tasks. We will test the hypothesis that in the course of schema instantiation, a task structure is encoded in the form of a low-dimensional structure in the space of connection weights, which is reflected in a low- dimensional subspace of neural dynamics. During new learning, the system benefits from the schema to narrow weight parameter search, thereby speeding up learning.

"Hippocampal-cortical networks underlying memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge ABSTRACT Language and memory overlap heavily in brain circuitry and in our day-to-day lives. Both are also frequently disrupted in neurological conditions such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. We have a limited understanding of the mechanisms by which cortical language centers integrate with memory circuits; for example, to support the retrieval of linguistic knowledge. This limits our insight into disease pathophysiology and slows the development of more effective therapies for cognitive impairments. This K23 will support an investigation of how language and memory integrate in the human brain, by harnessing unique innovations and resources. First, we will use special high-density grid and depth electrodes to record from many hundreds of local neuronal populations distributed throughout memory and language centers, among patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for refractory epilepsy. Second, to target distinct moments of linguistic-mnemonic integration, we have customized an auditory naming behavioral task that combines controlled yet natural language stimuli with memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge. Third, I will apply state-of-the-art analyses with pattern classifiers and computational linguistics, an approach that could improve the framework of how we understand neural representations of deep language processing. I will first evaluate whether the activity patterns in cortical language centers and the hippocampus reveal neural signatures of dynamic integration during knowledge retrieval, and whether their activity patterns reflect mutual information sufficient to predict the linguistic content of task trials (Aim 1). I will then use electrical stimulation to selectively disrupt neural processing in these regions, to determine if and how they contribute to distinct stages of language and memory integration (Aim 2). This approach will also allow us to probe whether the hippocampus is required for semantic memory, a long-debated question arising from classic literature. My mentorship team has a constellation of expertise aligning with my training plan and the goals of this investigation, including cortical language neurophysiology, hippocampal memory neurophysiology, and investigative neurostimulation. This proposal builds upon my prior expertise in translational intracranial recordings and neural signal processing, and my long-term career goal of understanding and improving treatments for cognitive impairments in epilepsy. I will receive training, coursework, and direct mentorship in skillsets that I will continue to use throughout my scientific career, including language and memory neurophysiology, human neurostimulation, neuroethics, machine learning, computational linguistics, scientific communication, and independent laboratory management. The knowledge and training acquired during this award period will allow me to establish an independent laboratory and emerge as a leader in human intracranial neurophysiology, applying my expertise to unmet needs in epilepsy. NARRATIVE Memory and language functions can be devastatingly impaired by neurological diseases such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. This investigation seeks to understand how the neural circuits that underlie these functions work together to retrieve knowledge from memory, a precious human ability used in our day-to- day lives.

"Neural mechanisms of specificity and generalization learning Project summary Memory-based cognition depends on both the ability to remember specific details of individual experiences (specificity) and the ability to combine information across experiences to derive new knowledge (generalization). It is well established that the hippocampus rapidly encodes specific events, but the mechanisms of memory generalization are less clear. Traditionally, a division of labor has been postulated between the hippocampus, learning rapidly to support specificity, and other memory systems, learning slowly and incrementally to support generalization. More recent research has also shown a role of the hippocampus in rapid generalization, where new knowledge is derived by combining information across a small number of events. It is currently debated whether the hippocampal contribution to generalization is fully explainable by its role in storing specific experiences or whether the hippocampus integrates information across experiences to form generalized knowledge. Furthermore, it is unclear whether generalization learning proceeds at the expense of memory for specific details or whether multiple types of memory representations form and co-exist to serve multiple forms of cognition. The current project tests the hypotheses that representations at distinct levels of specificity form in parallel along the long axis of the hippocampus through interactions with distinct cortical regions. More anterior generalized representations inform generalization. More posterior specific representations support memory specificity but can also inform generalization decisions under circumstances when generalized representations have not been formed. To test these hypotheses, the proposed studies use functional MRI in humans during concept-learning tasks in which both specificity and generalization learning is indexed using (1) behavioral methods, (2) cognitive modeling and model-based fMRI, and (3) neural pattern similarity analyses. The studies will determine the mechanism(s) of memory generalization and how it relates to memory for specific events, the degree to which the formation of distinct representation is under strategic control, and the hippocampal-cortical interactions that contribute to specificity and generalization learning. The results will reveal whether specificity and generalization are two behavioral expressions supported by a single neural representation, a single neural system that can form different types of memory representations under different task demands, or distinct neural systems that form distinct representations. The results will inform current theories of memory function and help reconcile a decades-long debate regarding the nature of concept representations. The basic science knowledge obtained here will help shed light on the memory and generalization mechanisms that may go awry in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Memory allows us to remember specific past experiences, but also find commonalities across experiences generalizable to novel situations. The proposed research will improve our understanding of mechanisms supporting memory specificity and generalization, their contribution to decision-making, and their implementation in the healthy brain. These findings will generate new predictions about the causes of a wide variety of memory impairments, such as reduced memory specificity in aging and Alzheimer’s disease, imbalance of specificity and generalization learning in anxiety, depression, and autism, and mixed patterns of impairments following a stroke.",Neural mechanisms of specificity and generalization learning,10224354,R01NS112366,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Episodic memory', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,322153
"The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative Music is a powerful memory cue that can reliably transport us to our past -- in  effect, strengthening the associative bond between our present and our past. Modern  neuroscientific investigations of episodic memory could benefit from the use of music due to its  role as a potent memory cue. In this proposal, my goal is to understand how music shapes memory   for past events and how these associations between events are represented in the brain.  The proposed work builds on recent functional MRI studies that have used naturalistic experimental  paradigms such as movie watching and recall to test and refine theories of memory  that (previously) had only been tested under highly-controlled conditions. Here we explore how film  scores shape memory for movies. In movies, film scores sometimes have recurrent structure where a  particular theme song will be repeated throughout, potentially bringing back to mind information  from previous events in which that theme song had been played. Based on prior work showing   that retrieval of a memory strengthens that memory, we predict that the presence of  recurrent musical structure in a film will trigger retrieval of previous events during  movie-watching, which (in turn) will boost memory for these events on a later recall test. In our  study, two groups of participants are recruited: The first group watches a version of a movie in  its original form (with the film score intact) and the control group watches the same film with the  entire film score removed (while preserving dialogue and ambient sounds). Participants from both  groups are asked to return the following day to recall the entire movie in chronological order. By  comparing neural activity between scenes containing music and previous scenes containing the same  (or similar) music between the two groups, we expect to find evidence of neural reinstatement of  past scenes in the music group; furthermore, we predict that higher levels of reinstatement during  movie-viewing will be associated with better subsequent recall of the movie in the music group  relative to the control group. This work will provide basic-science insight into how memory works  in real-world contexts. It will also shed light on how musical cues can strengthen memories and  improve recall; if the predicted cueing effects are observed, these techniques could be used in  future work to boost performance in memory-impaired clinical populations. The effects of music on memory in naturalistic settings are not yet well understood. In this  project, we aim to study how memory for films is affected by the presence or absence of the film  score and whether these effects can be measured neurally. This work will help develop new  neural measures of music-evoked episodic memory as well as expand our understanding of music's  effect on memory under natural conditions.",The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative,10334404,F99NS118740,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Distant', 'Electroencephalography', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Film', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Music', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'memory recall', 'memory retrieval', 'movie', 'novel', 'portability', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2021,47036
"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive. Indeed, recurrent or inappropriately expressed fearful memories are a major component of several psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Therefore, understanding how memory traces for fearful events are formed, change over time, under what conditions they remain specific or generalize, and how they are impacted by behavioral extinction are critical questions to not only understanding how the brain uses information but also for informing the development of new treatment/prevention strategies for disorders characterized by inappropriate fear memories. Here two PIs (Drs. Josselyn and Frankland), both New Investigators, will combine their expertise to address these important questions. Because all techniques are associated with caveats and limitations, we will use a variety of techniques including optogenetic manipulation, brain-wide neuronal activity mapping and the use of graph-theory to produce “engram maps” and real time in vivo calcium imaging combined with behavior. Together, the ability to manipulate and observe an engram as it forms, changes over time and with behavioral extinction is innovative and may lead to a shift in the very definition of an engram, as well as increase our understanding for developing treatments aimed at resolving inappropriate fear memories. Project Narrative More effective treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders will be facilitated by better understanding how the brain forms memory traces supporting fear memories, how these change over time and with extinction.","The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction",10087966,R01MH119421,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endoscopes', 'Event', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Opsin', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Virus', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'data analysis pipeline', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'fear memory', 'graph theory', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory consolidation', 'neuronal excitability', 'optogenetics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHLDRN (TORONTO),R01,2021,337780
"Circuit Dynamics for encoding and remembering sequence of events Project Summary We experience the world as a continuous sequence of events, but we remember the events as segmented episodes (e.g., my sister’s wedding). During encoding, we associate a sequence of relevant events and segment deviant events. At retrieval, episodic memory utilizes the encoded associations to replay the flow of events. The encoded associations lead to remembering the sequence of events that occurred within an episode better than the flow of events across segments. The hippocampus and the prefrontal cortices (PFC) are essential parts of the neural circuit for segmenting, linking and retrieving memories of associated events. This proposal aims to identify neural dynamics in the hippocampus-PFC circuit that support encoding a naturalistic flow of events, i.e., sequences of words. We will determine the neural dynamics using intracranial encephalography (iEEG) acquired from the hippocampus and PFC of epileptic patients, who have electrodes implemented for pre-surgical seizure monitoring. Our experiment requires patients to listen to a narrative and later recall the flow of events. During the past year, I developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that quantifies the associations of words depending on the narrative context. I will use NLP model for annotation of the iEEG data to determine neural dynamics engaged during encoding sequences of words. Our research program (mainly data collection), like all other human subject research, has been significantly affected by the COVID mitigation efforts. We were not able to collect the required iEEG data to fulfill the aims of the planned K99 phase during the past year. With the vaccination of researchers and medical staff and screening of patients before the hospitalization, our data collection program is reopening with considerations. The extension to the K99 will allow us to catch up with the data collection that is required for the planned training on advanced data analysis. The central hypotheses are that bidirectional communications between the hippocampus and PFC support the encoding of sequences of events and successful subsequent memory. To address a causal relationship between hippocampal function and event segmentation, I will study speech comprehension and speech memory in developmental amnesic patients who suffer from hippocampal damage and have trouble tracking reference points in a speech. The combination of iEEG, NLP modeling, and patients’ behavioral data will provide valuable insights into the neural dynamics of effective speech encoding that predicts subsequent memory, which may inform development into therapeutic interventions. Project Narrative The ability to segment the world into meaningful episodes engages the human hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Using direct electrophysiological recording from the human brain, advanced analytical techniques, Natural Language Processing models, and the behavior of patients with hippocampal lesions, this proposal will determine the neural dynamics for efficient encoding of sequences of words that predicts successful memory formation. The findings of this proposal may help inform the development of neural prosthetics for assisting patients with memory deficits.",Circuit Dynamics for encoding and remembering sequence of events,10375038,K99MH120048,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Subject Research', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Medical Staff', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Seizures', 'Sister', 'Speech', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Vaccination', 'advanced analytics', 'coronavirus disease', 'deviant', 'encephalography', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurodevelopment', 'patient screening', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2021,78705
"Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying neuronal sequence coordination across hippocampus and neocortex and their role in learning and memory. Cells that participated in a recent experience are reactivated in the form of ordered sequences that recapitulate behavior in a temporally compressed manner. These reactivations are coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the neocortex. It has been proposed that SWRs and associated neuronal sequences mediate memory consolidation, planning and learning but a direct proof of these functions is still lacking. Additionally, several brain disorders characterized by learning and memory deficits have been related to disrupted SWRs. To guide behavior and decision making, the neocortex is believed to generalize across individual experiences encoded in the hippocampus to infer environmental regularities and rules. SWRs entrain neocortical activity, but how downstream cortical areas read out the hippocampal code transmitted during SWRs and use this information to guide goal-oriented behavior is unknown.  I will perform silicon probe recordings and optogenetic manipulations in the hippocampus and its main cortical target regions of behaving rats and mice to test the functional role and circuit mechanisms of SWR sequences during the different phases of goal-oriented behavior. First, I will use a novel optogenetic approach for closed-loop manipulation of SWRs to directly test whether SWRs associated sequences support memory-guided behavior. My preliminary data supports the hypothesis that SWRs became longer with increased memory demands thus allowing extended replay events, and that those prolonged sequences are necessary and sufficient for memory-guided navigation and spatial learning. Second, I will examine the impact of SWRs on downstream cortical targets, in the context of goal-oriented spatial behavior. I will test if there is a specific functional topography of hippocampo-cortical interactions, with dorsal and ventral hippocampal SWRs propagating preferentially to retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices. I hypothesized that hippocampo –cortical synchrony during SWRs will gradually increase with learning and that this process could lead to the generation of abstract representations, or schemas, in the cortex that will facilitate future decisions. Finally, I will test whether SWR-associated cortical sequences are locally generated or inherited from the hippocampus and how different classes of interneurons contribute to them. To achieve this, I will record and optogenetically manipulate different cell sub-types in transgenic mice.  By using an innovative experimental approach, the proposed project will provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms and behavioral role of neuronal sequences involved in learning and memory. This knowledge will also shed light into the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in neural disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. It may also open new avenues for more targeted, closed-loop interventions in these disorders.  The scientific skills developed during the training period of this project will be crucial for the accomplishment of the immediate scientific goals and become the pillars for the research I will develop in my future independent laboratory. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to understand how distributed brain circuits generate neuronal dynamics that support learning and memory. It will directly test if the sequential reactivation of cell assemblies that recapitulate experience is necessary for memory-guided behavior and elucidate how these sequences are coordinated on a global scale. These experiments will not only be important for understanding the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory in healthy brains but also how neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer or schizophrenia lead to their impairment.",Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning,10432328,R00MH120343,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Spatial Behavior', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Viral', 'cell assembly', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'goal oriented behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIMH,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R00,2021,248680
"Tracking the dynamics of how schemas scaffold recall Project Summary Every new experience in our life takes place within the context of familiar environments and situations. However, most research on memory has focused on the artificial memorization of word lists, symbols or pictures; these studies do not meaningfully address how structured prior knowledge about the world (e.g., in the form of a familiar spatial map, or knowledge of how restaurant meals unfold over time) can scaffold new learning. In the proposed studies, I aim to precisely characterize how and where prior knowledge and new information are represented, how they get linked at encoding, and how they interact at recall to allow memories to be retrieved. In the first proposed study of my F99 phase, I test the hypothesis that hippocampal engagement at event boundaries during learning binds new information (i.e. objects) to the scaffold of existing knowledge (i.e. knowledge of a familiar location), and that hippocampal activation during recall mediates the successful retrieval of the bound object from the location in which it was stored. I also test the hypothesis that distinctive representations of spatial locations in the brain will reduce interference between objects stored in those locations. There is a potential downside to using prior knowledge as a scaffold: When there is too much information attached to one part of the scaffold, old and new memories will interfere with each other. How, then, could someone prioritize the retrieval of new memories over older (now-irrelevant) memories that were linked to the scaffold? Recent research on intentional forgetting suggests a solution to this limitation. Specifically, in my second proposed study, I test the hypothesis (supported by neurophysiological evidence, prior neuroimaging results, and computational models) that previously encoded memories can be weakened by moderately activating their neural representation, thereby “cleaning” the scaffold and reducing interference. In the K00 phase, I will extend my research to identify pathologies in how clinical populations use prior knowledge to interpret and remember their experiences, using tools from computational psychiatry; I also plan to design new technological tools to address these issues. Overall, the proposed project makes use of naturalistic and ecologically valid stimuli (in the form of continuous stimuli and immersive virtual reality) paired with advanced machine learning tools applied to brain imaging data, to study the fundamental nature of how new and old information are linked to allow learning. In the long-term, the findings from this project regarding how prior knowledge can be optimally leveraged to support new learning will lead to the development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals make better use of prior knowledge to support new learning, as well as remedies for groups where deficiencies in prior knowledge prevent them from learning properly. Project Narrative In my dissertation, I will use newly-developed machine learning techniques to study how the brain uses prior knowledge (about the spatial structure of an environment, or how certain types of events unfold in time) to scaffold new learning. By precisely characterizing how this scaffolding process works, my research will help to identify ways in which prior knowledge can be more optimally leveraged to support learning. This will lead to the development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals make better use of intact prior knowledge to support new learning, as well as remedies for groups where deficiencies in prior knowledge prevent them from learning properly.",Tracking the dynamics of how schemas scaffold recall,10156352,F99NS120644,"['Address', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Restaurants', 'Retrieval', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'field study', 'forgetting', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'phase 1 testing', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual world']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2021,40000
"Individualized Closed Loop TMS for Working Memory Enhancement ABSTRACT The proposed project is designed to increase precision and responsiveness in transcranial magnetic stimulation therapies across the neuropsychiatric spectrum and specifically in working memory deficits which are common across a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions. Cutting edge functional imaging studies suggest that using multiple types of imaging datasets yield more reliable estimates of brain network communication. Our methods yield a combined resting and task fMRI functional network mapping individualized for each participant that will allow precise identification of brain stimulation targets associated with optimal working memory performance (Aim 1). To close the loop in designing TMS protocols that respond to an individual person's brain activation state, we will also develop and test a real-time brain decoder to determine when optimal working memory states are online (Aim 2). By iteratively testing excitatory neuromodulation frequencies at this stimulation site and capturing the relative movement of brain states towards or away from optimal working memory states, we will settle on the optimal frequency for augmenting working memory performance in each individual (Aim 3). We will validate this approach by administering either the `best' or `worst' (random assignment to each participant) neuromodulation protocol across several days then testing working memory performance and brain activation in a final MRI scan session. The multi-modal based TMS targeting and individualized frequency optimization techniques will be based on our findings and packaged into a combined software suite in Docker containers made available to the scientific and clinical community at the conclusion of this project (Aim 4). NARRATIVE The next generation of brain stimulation therapies for mental health disorders will be more individualized and will use cutting edge neuroscience and brain imaging techniques to guide them. To propel this transition, we will develop a more spatiotemporally precise and reliable target for transcranial magnetic stimulation as well as a stimulation frequency chosen for each individual based on functional MRI and in-scanner TMS readouts that optimize working memory brain states for each participant. The integrated targeting and neuromodulation tailored to each person will be accomplished with a single software suite that will be the product of this investigation and will help scientists and clinicians to accomplish robust individualized targeting and effective brain responsive neuromodulation.",Individualized Closed Loop TMS for Working Memory Enhancement,10204952,R01MH120811,"['Aging', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Docking', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'MRI Scans', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Movement', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'awake', 'base', 'design', 'health application', 'imaging study', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'next generation', 'noninvasive brain stimulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'portability', 'recurrent neural network', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,723565
"Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies   Project Summary Decades of psychology research have shown that working memory is limited, and humans can only hold a few items in mind at the same time. However, cognitive tasks like planning and problem solving require access to many pieces of information at once. To overcome this constraint, we enlist mnemonic strategies, for instance grouping pieces of information into chunks, as we commonly do to remember telephone or social security numbers. Mnemonic chunking allows us to flexibly organize information on line, providing a fundamental building block for advanced cognitive abilities. Chunking impairments occur when damage or dysfunction involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), for instance in patients with schizophrenia, and severely compromises overall cognitive function. Thus, determining how the brain organizes information is a necessary step toward understanding the mechanisms of advanced cognition, and how these go awry in disease states. A key challenge is that strategies for organizing information are self-generated and highly variable in a laboratory setting. A central innovation of this proposal is the novel computational approach used to identify spontaneous mnemonic chunking in macaque monkeys. This is critical because animal models allow us to interrogate brain function with advanced neurophysiological tools. Here, we will use high-density, multi-site recording and targeted neuromodulation to understand the circuit mechanisms that chunk mnemonic information. Previous theoretical work suggests that chunks arise from compressed working memory representations that act as neural shorthand, economizing on processing resources at the cost of degrading some original information. Neurons in dlPFC encode items in working memory, and their dynamics are shaped by recurrent interactions with the basal ganglia. Thus, we hypothesize that corticostriatal interactions promote the efficient reorganization of working memory that underlies chunking. To test this we will investigate dlPFC- striatal dynamics when monkeys spontaneously chunk information in a self-organized working memory task. We will record large numbers of single neurons and local field potentials, and dynamically decode representations held in working memory to assess how mnemonic codes and corticostriatal interactions change when items are or are not chunked. In addition, exogenous stimulation will test the causal role of striatal circuits in promoting the formation of mnemonic chunks. Together, these experiments will determine how the brain establishes mnemonic chunks to optimize working memory performance. This will shed light on a fundamental feature of advanced cognition, and how dysfunction in these mechanisms could give rise to disorders of thought and memory. Finally, understanding mechanisms that optimize cognitive function in a biological system may fuel creative advances that optimize performance in artificial intelligence systems.   Project Narrative This project focuses on understanding circuit dynamics in the prefrontal cortex that mediate mnemonic chunking, a critical strategy for improving working memory performance in advanced cognition. Specifically, we will assess how mnemonic information is bound together in the dynamics of frontal and striatal circuits, and whether these processes can be enhanced with targeted circuit modulation. Our results could provide insights into core deficits in cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia, and open the door for novel approaches that enhance cognitive function in the setting of working memory deficits.",Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies,10098347,R01MH121480,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Security Number', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Work', 'behavior test', 'biological systems', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'density', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'memory recall', 'microstimulation', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,460527
"The laminar organization of 'index' versus 'attribute' coding in neocortex We propose a circuit-level principal underlying how brains acquire 'episodic' memories and reprocess them into compact, efficient 'schemas': The attributes or 'contents' of experience are represented primarily in the deeper layers of neocortex (NC), whereas the superficial layers are dedicated to encoding the contexts in which the attributes occur. Synaptic associations between superficial context codes and deep attribute codes permit contexts to evoke appropriate attribute output hence enabling memory recall and predictive behavior.  The hippocampus (HC) is essential for acquisition of memories and for their reprocessing into efficient, schematic representations of the world. NC exhibits dense local but sparse long-range connectivity, which severely limits its ability to make rapid, long-range associations. HC likely solves this dilemma by merging the totality of the brain's current internal state (i.e., sensory input and internal variables such as hunger, fear, current goals) into a unique, 'index' code that is projected to NC, and associated with its current, distributed, attribute representation. Retrieval of an index code evokes the corresponding attributes. Such HC-orchestrated retrieval may enable the gradual rewiring of NC circuitry in a manner that captures the overall statistics of experience, much the same way as deep, artificial, neural networks learn incrementally by small connection weight adjustments directed by the overall statistics of the input. Our hypothesis on the laminar division of labor in this process is based on the facts that HC output is directed primarily to upper layers of NC, which implements a 'spatial' coding scheme that is lost after HC lesions; and that the deeper layers of NC frequently exhibit more robust responsiveness to and discrimination of sensory inputs than the superficial ones.  We propose to record cellular level, neural ensemble activity simultaneously from deep and superficial layers in primary and association cortex, using high-density, electrophysiological recording. First, we attempt to establish the 'attribute vs index' principal by showing that deep cells shift their firing locations with shifts in the relevant sensory attributes, whereas superficial cells do not. Next we test the hypothesis that, as NC accumulates large amounts of diverse experience, attribute representations in deeper layers becomes sparser and more categorically organized, whereas superficial layer coding is relatively unchanged. To accomplish this, we employ a recent chemogenetic advance that enables us to acquire large amounts of resting-state cellular data, in which we expect the predicted changes will be most easily observed. We also explore the statistics of excitatory-inhibitory cell functional connectivity that may underlie such coding statistics changes. The expected advances in understanding cortical memory and schema encoding circuits will ultimately improve clinical assessment of, and intervention in memory and cognitive disorders. This project uses advanced electrophysiological neural ensemble recording to test circuit-level hypotheses about the fundamental interactions between the hippocampal formation and the neocortex that enables episodic memories to be captured quickly and subsequently consolidated into efficient schemas for adaptive behavior. The overarching hypothesis is that the laminar structure of neocortex is optimized to subserve a particular type of information representation, in which the global context of experiences is encoded in sparse activity patterns in Layer II-III that are derived from the output of the hippocampal formation and that associatively link together the attributes (i.e., content) of experience, which are represented more densely in the deeper layers (Layer V). Overall, these experiments will shed new light on the cortex-wide, circuit-level details of how memory works, leading ultimately to improved interventions in cases of memory impairment due to trauma, disease and the aging process and other cognitive deficits such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders.",The laminar organization of 'index' versus 'attribute' coding in neocortex,10205913,R01NS121764,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hunger', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Memory', 'Memory Disorders', 'Memory impairment', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Supporting Cell', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Weight', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'association cortex', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'density', 'detector', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'learning network', 'memory acquisition', 'memory recall', 'neural circuit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trend', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2021,1988300
"CRCNS: Role of Mossy Cells in Gating Plasticity Hippocampal Granule Cells We propose an international collaborative multidisciplinary research project to investigate neural circuit mechanisms of spatial memory formation in the mammalian brain. In both humans and rodents, the hippocampus is a brain region required to store long-term memories. This process depends on activity- dependent changes in the strengths of connections between neurons, known as synaptic plasticity. In the input layer of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, a principal cell type called the granule cell receives synaptic inputs from cortex carrying information about spatial navigation, and it is thought that synaptic plasticity at these inputs stores a map of space in dentate granule cells. Like most hippocampal and cortical circuits, the dentate gyrus is comprised of multiple neuronal cell types, many of which are inhibitory interneurons. However, the dentate gyrus also contains a unique class of local excitatory interneurons,, called mossy cells, which form local synapses onto granule cells and inhibitory interneurons, but do not project outside the dentate gyrus. It is a major goal of this project to reconcile the direct excitatory and indirect inhibitory influences of mossy cells on granule cells, which could have opposing effects on spatial information processing and memory storage. Recent work has shown that mossy cells are required for the formation of new spatial memories, though the underlying mechanism is completely unknown. Interestingly, the mossy cell inputs and cortical inputs to granule cells segregate onto proximal and distal regions of granule cell dendrites, respectively. In other cell types, synchronous activation of proximal and distal input pathways evokes local dendritic spikes that potently induce synaptic plasticity. However, whether this occurs in granule cells in response to coincidence of feedforward input from cortex and feedback input from mossy cells has not been investigated. Therefore, in order to test the role of mossy cell input in gating dendritic spiking and plasticity in dentate granule cells, we propose to 1) directly record from granule cell dendrites in vitro in response to precisely controlled input patterns, 2) directly image the activity of granule cell dendrites in vivo during spatial navigation while chemogenetically silencing mossy cells, and 3) develop experimentally-constrained computational models of dentate gyrus cells and circuits to investigate how a dedicated feedback neuron type like mossy cells affects the storage and recall of information in a neural circuit. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Humans with temporal lobe epilepsy and traumatic brain injury exhibit specific degeneration of hippocampal mossy cells, and suffer from deficits in memory and cognition. While existing pharmacological treatments reduce seizure frequency and severity in some epileptic patients, no treatments exist for the associated learning and memory disorders. We expect our research to generate new insight and inform the development of new treatment strategies for neural circuit dysfunction. n/a",CRCNS: Role of Mossy Cells in Gating Plasticity Hippocampal Granule Cells,10169524,R01MH121979,"['Affect', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Calcium Spikes', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Dendrites', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Germany', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Interneurons', 'Learning Disorders', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Memory Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Supporting Cell', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'dentate gyrus', 'design', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'granule cell', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'long term memory', 'neural circuit', 'place fields', 'response', 'spatial memory', 'treatment strategy', 'two-photon', 'way finding']",NIMH,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,186674
"The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay Project Summary The hippocampus is a critical site for rapid memory formation and retrieval, with extensively documented functions representing spatial and navigational variables, yet less is known of the means by which it guides behavior. Bursts of hippocampal activity identified in many species as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events are promising neural mechanisms to link hippocampal activity and behavioral function, since during SWRs hippocampus can represent positions the animal previously experienced, or will traverse in the near future. This proposal considers the food-caching behaviors of chickadees, who use a hippocampal-dependent, one- shot memory to guide cache retrieval. This behavior is exceptionally promising to link hippocampal activity to individual experiences, which has been a barrier to determining the nature of representations during SWR and their function in previous studies. These studies will develop a comprehensive account of how chickadee behavior is affected by cache site memory, determine whether SWRs are related to memory-specific components of caching behavior, and determine whether SWRs represent individual cache sites to assist later retrieval. I hypothesize that memory-guided behavior is distinguishable from random foraging. I will use video tracking to measure the behavioral microstructure of chickadee caching behavior, including postural and gaze time series, and develop quantitative models of behavioral motifs and their temporal structure. Using these tools to compare memory-guided and random foraging behaviors, I will develop decoders that indicate precisely how and when behavior appears memory-guided. I hypothesize that SWRs occur more often, and are more predictive of behavior, when behavior is memory- guided. I will use electrophysiology in freely moving chickadees during caching to relate SWRs to the microstructural analysis of behavior and decoding of behavioral strategy. I hypothesize that SWRs reactivate representations of previous, individual caching events, and that this reactivation improves subsequent retrieval for that individual site. Using electrophysiological recordings in caching birds, I will relate reactivations to the accuracy of retrieval behavior. Using online SWR detection and suppression, I will further determine if SWRs causally affect later retrieval behavior. Project Narrative Food caching birds are a unique model system for dissecting the fundamental principles of hippocampal function. Thorough characterization and computational modeling of this behavior, and the specific contribution of hippocampal memory, will allow insight into the neural mechanisms by which hippocampal representations guide behavior.

"Decoding and Selective Modulation of Human Memory During Awake/Sleep Cycles PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Episodic memories integrate the content of human experience in space and time and constitute the core of one's identity. Memory formation involves processing, and constructing interpretations of the incoming information in our daily lives and is one of the first functions compromised in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. With population aging, we face a “Cognitive Tsunami” of millions of people with memory disorders. Thus, understanding neural mechanisms of memory, and finding interventions that enhance these processes is a critical endeavor with the potential to improve the lives of countless people world-wide.  Although it is established that memory is critical for cognitive well-being, and sleep is critical for memory consolidation, the underlying mechanisms in the human brain are poorly understood. Research on memory and sleep so far has suffered from a gap between non-invasive cognitive research in humans and detailed electrophysiological research in animals. Moreover, most human studies are dominated by stimulus response methodologies where the presented stimuli constitute limited, discretized, aspects of memory. This approach, albeit well-controlled, is far from the rich narrative of episodes we experience. Thus, to mechanistically probe human memory consolidation, it is imperative to (a) employ methodologies that incorporate the continuous and multimodal nature of experience; (b) identify relevant neural activation patterns and how they are transformed and reactivated during sleep; (c) establish means to causally modulate memory processes during sleep.  Building upon our exploratory U01 project, this proposal seeks a breakthrough in our understanding by going beyond the state-of-the-art, and via the application of integrative and multidisciplinary approaches. It capitalizes on a highly unique opportunity to record and modulate neuronal activity of a large number of single neurons and neuronal assemblies in the human brain. In parallel, it exploits the high dimensionality of the data as an asset through the use of cutting-edge Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, which have emerged as promising analysis tools. Specifically, the project will investigate the presence, and decoding, of distributed neural patterns associated with memory for different aspects of experience during wakefulness and identify their reactivation during sleep. The proposal aims to selectively modulate memory via application of novel closed-loop stimulation in sleep in concert with the DL model predictions.  We anticipate that this project is poised to shed light on the relationship between sleep and memory, and its modulation from a novel perspective. Such an ambitious goal can only be achieved with unrivaled combination of experience, access to a clinical setting, and interdisciplinary collaborations such as those proposed in this project. By combining the opportunity to stimulate and record neural activity with the computational power of artificial intelligence, this project aims to offer findings with far reaching implications for basic neuroscience and contribute to the development of novel therapies for human memory disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Memory impairment and disruptions in sleep architecture co-occur in various neurological disorders, suggesting that elucidating the mechanisms underlying the entanglement between memory and sleep may offer the opportunity to improve the lives of people suffering from memory disorders as well as promote the significance of healthy sleep habits for the general public. The proposed multidisciplinary project seeks a transformative understanding of memory processes and consolidation during sleep by combining the unique capability of direct recordings from the human brain at multiple levels of resolution—single neurons, localized neuronal assemblies, intracranial local field potentials—in neurosurgical patients monitored with intracranial depth electrodes, and computational power of artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the project will probe causal mechanisms of consolidation by application of auditory and electrical stimulations—with high temporal and spatial precision— using innovative model-driven closed-loop technology, which can help lay the foundation for future therapeutic interventions of memory disorders.",Decoding and Selective Modulation of Human Memory During Awake/Sleep Cycles,10289993,U01NS123128,"['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory Disorders', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tsunami', 'Visual', 'Wakefulness', 'aging population', 'awake', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'learning strategy', 'memory consolidation', 'memory process', 'memory recognition', 'memory retrieval', 'movie', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sleep behavior', 'tool', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2021,1350000
"Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Working memory (WM), the cognitive entity that allows for temporary storage and manipulation of informa- tion, is crucial for much of what gives life subjective meaning, and enables an individual to participate in larger society. This includes following a conversation, finding a supermarket item, planning, driving, learning new skills—most anything that requires holding in mind information from long-term memory and/or sensory input for use requires WM. As a result, WM dysfunction has devastating effects, and regrettably, millions—individuals with schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, dementia, and more—experience varying degrees of WM impairment, which is almost totally treatment resistant. Given its role in neurocognitive health and disease, understanding the mechanisms of WM is imperative. Correspondingly, this project will explore in depth the circuit basis for WM.  The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be a primary orchestrator of WM, processing input from other brain regions for WM instantiation. In spatial working memory (SWM), a WM subdomain regularly studied across species, interactions of the PFC with the ventral hippocampus and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) are considered essential, with PFC-MD interactions undergirding neural maintenance of WM content and subsequent action selection. Notably, the PFC is quite heterogeneous, being composed of layers that differ both in their cellular composition and in their connectivity. Yet the possibility that these laminar subregions might uniquely contribute to the multifaceted ways in which the PFC empowers WM is only now being explored: recent studies suggest that superficial PFC layers support WM content maintenance, while deep PFC layers support post-maintenance action selection. This proposal expands upon these studies by using novel technology to explore cellular-resolution laminar representations in WM.  Specifically, this proposal examines what WM content is encoded in the activity of individual cells vs. popula- tions in the different PFC layers (Aim 1) and assesses the dependence of these laminar WM representations on input from the MD (Aim 2). To do so, calcium imaging will be performed through microendoscopes in mice genetically and surgically specified to express calcium indicators in particular PFC layers. These mice will perform a trial-based delayed nonmatch to sample WM task in a custom-built, automated 8-armed radial maze, and for Aim 2 will have MD input to the PFC optogenetically silenced during behavior and imaging (to simulate the MD-PFC hypoconnectivity regularly observed in those with WM deficits). Finally, for rigorous mapping of behavior to neural activity, novel machine learning behavioral classification paradigms will be used.  WM provides the cognitive building blocks for the very fabric of quotidian life—sustaining social relationships, maintaining a job, living independently, learning new things and more. Given such complexity, detailed interrogation of WM circuit mechanisms is required. Accordingly, this proposal uses emerging technologies to explore circuit mechanisms of both WM function and dysfunction, advancing pursuits of therapeutic innovation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Working memory, the cognitive entity through which information can be temporarily held in mind for processing, is fundamental to many essential human activities, from holding a conversation, to walking home from the bus stop, to introspecting. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been known to undergird working memory, with information maintenance empowered by input from the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), but how the different PFC layers support this complex and versatile capability remains largely unclear. This proposal will assess the neural representations in PFC layers during spatial working memory, and how they depend on MD input, to better establish circuit mechanisms for working memory instantiation, to the end of moving us closer to eventual therapies for the millions affected by working memory impairment.",Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze,10198670,F31MH124323,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Critical Thinking', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medial', 'Medial Dorsal Nucleus', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Mind', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opsin', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Supermarket', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Textiles', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'arm', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cellular imaging', 'cost', 'empowered', 'experience', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'long term memory', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'microendoscope', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'self-directed learning', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'social relationships', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2021,46036
"Optimizing sleep spindle measurements as translational assays of memory consolidation This research proposal addresses a key challenge to drug development: the paucity of biomarkers that reveal whether interventions affect implicated brain circuitry at early stages, in animals and humans, before embarking on lengthy and expensive clinical trials. Studies of humans and rodents have established sleep spindles, defining EEG oscillations of stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as a mechanism of memory consolidation. A growing body of work implicates sleep spindle abnormalities in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders characterized by memory impairment. In schizophrenia, sleep spindle deficits predict impaired sleep- dependent memory consolidation. Findings that increasing spindles via drugs or auditory or transcranial brain stimulation during sleep improves memory in healthy people, provides the impetus to target spindles to improve memory in disorders. But targeting spindles does not inevitably improve memory. Complementary rodent and human studies provide an explanation: sleep-dependent memory consolidation relies not on spindles alone, but on their precise temporal coordination with the other two cardinal NREM sleep oscillations: cortical slow oscillations (SOs) and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. These findings make it clear that while spindles are promising targets for improving memory, (i) effective therapies need to increase spindles AND preserve or enhance their coupling with SOs and ripples, and (ii) to evaluate efficacy, we need new assays to identify spindles that couple with SOs and ripples to mediate memory versus those that do not. We propose to: (i) identify the most powerful translational measures of sleep spindles as assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation (UG3), and (ii) to noninvasively manipulate them to compare their responses in healthy humans and rodents (UH3). Using invasive recordings in epilepsy patients and local field potentials (LFPs) in rats, we will first demonstrate that spindles that couple with both SOs and ripples (TriCS: triple-coupled spindles) are associated with memory consolidation, thereby validating TriCS as a translational biomarker of memory. We will then use machine learning to develop a classifier that identifies TriCS based solely on their scalp EEG features. We will validate the EEG spindle classifier by applying it to a dataset from healthy humans to demonstrate that TriCS, but not non-coupled spindles, correlate with memory consolidation. In both species, we will determine which spindle assay TriCS, SO-coupled spindles (SOCS) or total spindles predicts memory best. Finally, we will noninvasively manipulate the spindle assays in humans and rats. Genetic studies are implicating specific pathophysiologic mechanisms of spindle deficits in schizophrenia and autism and identifying novel targets and treatments. The rodent and human spindle assays that we will develop will facilitate the translation of these advances to the clinic by allowing the efficient evaluation of potential interventions early in the treatment development pipeline and the identification of the most promising candidates for clinical trials. A fundamental challenge to finding effective treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders is the paucity of biomarkers that can gauge whether a potential intervention affects abnormal circuitry early in the treatment development pipeline, before embarking on expensive and lengthy clinical trials. This research proposal will develop novel physiological assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation in humans and rodents that can be used to predict the efficacy of newly emerging treatments. These assays will enable the efficient screening and identification of treatments that can alleviate highly disabling cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",Optimizing sleep spindle measurements as translational assays of memory consolidation,10112344,UG3MH125273,"['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Eszopiclone', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Polysomnography', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rodent', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'clinical candidate', 'density', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'improved', 'memory consolidation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'preservation', 'response', 'screening', 'sleep spindle', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,UG3,2021,734247
"Neural signatures of virtual and real-world navigation and spatial learning PROJECT SUMMARY Navigation is one of our most foundational behavioral capacities, and substantial work using rodent models has established the hippocampus as a critical contributor to this complex behavior. However, efforts to model these effects in humans have been limited, both in scope and generalizability. Little work has explored the interaction in the hippocampus between navigation and foundational non-navigation learning processes, like statistical learning, and it therefore remains unclear how navigation processes are integrated with and may be supported by these learning mechanisms. Further, studies in humans have primarily consisted of virtual navigation, limiting applicability and relevance of the established neural signals to real-world navigation behavior. Understanding how navigation and statistical learning compete or cooperate in the human hippocampus will significantly inform models of memory systems and consolidation, and addressing these questions in a real-world paradigm will close a wide gap in our understanding of human navigation. This requires a multimodal approach, coupling the high temporal and spatial resolution of intracranial EEG (iEEG) in epilepsy patients with quantitative behavioral measures of human navigation and learning. In my doctoral dissertation work thus far, I have used behavioral, computational, and iEEG methods to test hypotheses about the interaction between statistical learning and spatial navigation in the human hippocampus and related structures. My work has produced impactful findings via novel computational modeling techniques and innovative multivariate iEEG analyses. In my proposed research and training program, I will use a cutting-edge research method to collect direct neural recordings from chronic brain implants in human participants as they physically ambulate in the real world. Through my multidisciplinary research mentors, this experience will provide me training with novel research methodology and ecologically valid experiment design, as well as clinical perspectives, considerations, and practices for working with patients with epilepsy. In my proposed postdoctoral training phase, I will pursue a more clinical focus, returning to the question of how modern cognitive neuroscience can guide assessments and therapies for hippocampal disease. I will gain theoretical and practical experience with high-resolution imaging and data collection with hippocampal atrophy populations, including epilepsy and Alzheimer’s patients. This research program has the potential to inform and substantially extend models of human navigation and memory by exploring the intersection of multiple processing demands on the hippocampus as a shared neural resource, and how these processes operate in the real world. This work represents the convergence of disparate literatures on hippocampal function, and informs diagnosis and treatment of hippocampal patients. This program will equip me not only with expertise in behavioral, computational, and neuroscientific methodologies, but the basic and clinical theoretical acumen necessary to conduct independent investigation as a principal investigator across disciplines. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research program seeks to evaluate and extend theories of spatial navigation and learning in humans by assessing the complex role of the hippocampus. The series of proposed projects stands to significantly benefit public health by exploring behavioral and neural assays of hippocampal disease in patient populations, with the potential to ultimately influence therapies for associated navigational and memory deficits. Integration of behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging methods, across basic and clinical approaches, are key components of this project which will enable empirically and theoretically supported paths forward in addressing this particularly debilitating form of neurodegeneration.",Neural signatures of virtual and real-world navigation and spatial learning,10393754,F99NS125835,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Animal Model', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Ethics', 'Felis catus', 'Fire - disasters', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Movement', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Organism', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high resolution imaging', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'human model', 'innovation', 'learned behavior', 'multimodality', 'neural implant', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'patient population', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial memory', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'theories', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'way finding']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,F99,2021,45044
"Neural Dynamics of Local Sleep Spindles and Their Role in Memory Project Summary During sleep, our brains remain active and exhibit a range of characteristic electrical signals not observed during awake periods. These characteristic signals are assumed to be fundamental events in the sleeping brain’s organization of information into our memories. The research described in this proposal will utilize intracranial depth electrode data to further our understanding of memory consolidation in humans. Despite the fundamental role sleep and memory play in our lives, little is definitively known about how memories are formed and maintained. The availability of intracranial data presents a rare opportunity for fresh insight. The research described in this proposal will determine the role local spindles play in memory consolidation. Spindles are transient bursts of 11-16 Hz oscillations in the electroencephalogram, and their activity could serve as a unique biomarker for mental health conditions and memory-related pathology and performance. Spindles were once considered relatively uniform electrical events, globally distributed throughout the neocortex. This understanding is complicated by recent findings of local spindles restricted to specific brain regions. The role of local spindles in memory consolidation remains a mystery. Aim 1 will determine if local spindle activity (like global spindle activity) is sensitive to the acquisition of new information related to a procedural memory task. Task-related sounds played during sleep are known to reactivate the associated memories and lead to improved recall of those memories after awakening. The replay of select auditory cues during sleep, which is known to bias memory formation, will allow us to hone in on and examine the neural dynamics associated with those particular moments in time. We will examine how the local spindle neural dynamics that immediately follow cue presentation relate to improvement on the task. The use of intracranial data will allow us not only to detect local spindles, but also to relate them to activity in deep brain structures like the hippocampus, which is thought to play a critical role in sleep-mediated memory consolidation. Aim 2 will employ the same procedure as in Aim 1, but using a declarative memory task in which subjects are asked to recall the locations of various objects presented on a computer screen. Success in our aims will provide a detailed understanding of how local spindle dynamics contribute to both declarative and procedural memory consolidation and inform the broader effort to understand how oscillatory activity during sleep consolidates memories. This work will also support the identification of effective sleep interventions for memory improvement in health and disease. Project Narrative During sleep, our brains remain active and exhibit a range of characteristic electrical signals not observed during awake periods; these signals are believed to be fundamental to the organization of information into memories. The research described in this proposal will utilize intracranial depth electrode data to further our understanding of memory consolidation in humans during sleep. The knowledge gained from this work will not only advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which memories are formed in the normal working brain, but also help us understand how these mechanisms fail in the brains of those suffering from health disorders associated with cognitive and memory impairment.",Neural Dynamics of Local Sleep Spindles and Their Role in Memory,10289438,R21MH127567,"['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smell Perception', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'improved', 'information organization', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'non rapid eye movement', 'procedural memory', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'sleep spindle', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'success']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R21,2021,246424
"Critical role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells The goal of this proposal is to study the role of transcription factor TCF-1 in determining the epigenetic identity of memory CD8+ T cells. Our adaptive immune system has evolved a unique capacity to remember a pathogen through the generation of memory T cells, which protect the host in the event of reinfection. A better understanding of memory T cell differentiation is crucial for developing strategies to limit T cell responses in organ transplantation or enhance T cell responses during chronic infections. Although it is known that the transcription factor TCF-1 is required for memory CD8+ T cell function, the mechanisms through which this protein controls memory T cell fate remain unclear. Recently, we discovered that a mechanism through which TCF-1 controls the development of T cells relates to its unprecedented ability to create the chromatin accessibility landscape of naïve T cells. We found that TCF-1 is selectively enriched at genomic regions that become accessible at the earliest stages of development and is required for the accessibility of these regulatory elements. At the single-cell level, TCF-1 can dictate a coordinate opening of chromatin in T cells. Moreover, ectopic TCF-1 can directly erase repressive chromatin marks in non-T cells, generating de novo open chromatin and inducing the expression of T cell genes. While our recent data determined the novel role of TCF-1 on the epigenome during T cell development, our findings also raised another critical question: what is the role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells? We hypothesize that TCF-1 in cooperation with transcription factor partners defines the epigenetic landscape of memory T cells. Our new preliminary data further indicate that TCF-1 expression post T cell activation in vitro can lead to gains in chromatin accessibility at pro-memory genes. However, it remains unclear if TCF-1 expression in T cells responding to an infection can create the epigenetic identity of memory T cells. The domains of TCF-1 required for targeting the chromatin and its potential cooperating factors also remain unknown. How TCF-1 dependent changes on the epigenome relate to pro-memory genes needs to be defined. To answer these questions, we will interrogate the effect of TCF-1 and its potential partners on the chromatin state and accessibility of CD8+ T cells in vitro. Using the state-of-the-art tools, we will generate the map of TCF-1 dependent 3D genome organization and define how changes on the epigenome relate to memory genes. We will further translate these findings in vivo exploiting single-cell epigenomic, transcriptomic, and flow cytometry assays. The expected outcome of this proposal is a detailed understanding of the fundamental interaction between TCF-1 and the chromatin in peripheral T cells which can be exploited to devise combination therapies including epigenetic editing to selectively alter T cell fate at will. Our adaptive immune system has evolved a unique capacity to remember a pathogen through the generation of memory T cells, which protect the host in the event of reinfection.
