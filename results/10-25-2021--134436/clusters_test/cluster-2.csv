"Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas PROJECT SUMMARY Meningiomas, which arise from arachnoid cells, make up >1/3 of all intracranial tumors. While typically benign, these tumors induce clinical symptoms due to mass effect and peritumoral edema. In cases requiring intervention, gross total resection provides the best outcomes when possible. However, treatment strategy is ultimately decided by determining the proper balance between surgical difficulty and the patient's overall health. Two mechanical properties are important predictors of surgical difficulty: tumor stiffness and adherence to surrounding tissues. Knowledge of these properties before surgery would allow clinicians to more accurately assess surgical risk and identify the most effective treatment strategy. Mechanical properties are difficult to predict by conventional imaging approaches, but can be directly assessed by Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and related Slip Interface Imaging (SII). In published studies, we have shown that MRE-based stiffness estimates are significantly correlated with tumor stiffness in meningiomas and pituitary adenomas. Furthermore, SII accurately predicted tumor adherence in meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas. Still, challenges remain to make these findings clinically-impactful. For estimating stiffness, the primary limitation lies in resolution. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will develop a voxel- wise classifier of tumor stiffness. This aim will build on our recently published neural network-based inversion (NNI), which has demonstrated superior performance to conventional direct inversions in simulation and in the brain. In Aim 1a, we will advance NNI by implementing more complex neural network architectures and creating more realistic simulations for training. In Aim 1b, the advances will be validated in a phantom with inhomogeneous stiffness. Finally, in Aim 1c with the aid of our Neurosurgery collaborators, we will collect a large sample of surgical stiffness assessments. We will use these assessments to train a voxel-wise stiffness classifier, which will then be validated in a separate test set. This aim will result in a map that conveys both stiffness and confidence in the prediction on a scale that is clinically meaningful to surgeons. The most-pressing limitations in SII include the subjective interpretation of the images and the lack of spatially resolved predictions. Aim 2 will address these challenges by developing a voxel-wise slip interface classifier. In Aim 2a, we will investigate a neural network-based predictor of slip interfaces to add to our current methods. In Aim 2b, we will evaluate if this new method can improve predictions in phantom experiments. In Aim 2c, we will again leverage surgical assessments of meningioma adherence to train and test a voxel-wise classifier. The result of this aim will be a map of tumor adherence represented as an easily interpreted probability. Taken together, these aims will provide neurosurgeons with clinically-important information to improve patient management. More broadly, technical advances made in this project will impact the entire MRE field. PROJECT NARRATIVE Meningiomas are the most common type of intracranial tumor and are best treated by total resection when possible. The mechanical properties of these tumors are important factors in surgical difficulty, where soft, non- adherent tumors are more easily removed that firm or adherent tumors. This project will use Magnetic Resonance Elastography and related Slip Interface Imaging to directly measure these properties, providing new clinically-important information to neurosurgeons and patients.",Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas,10071162,R01EB027064,"['Acoustic Neuroma', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Arachnoid mater', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Skull Base Neoplasms', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'mechanical properties', 'meningioma', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neurosurgery', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,350595
"Mechanisms Determining Dysregulation of the NRF2 Oxidative Stress Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ABSTRACT  The principle investigator, Dr. Travis Schrank, MD, PhD, is a first-year faculty member in the University of North Carolina Department of Otolaryngology. He has been hired in a surgeon-scientist role and presently has 75% protected time for research. His past training in computational biophysics and experimental biochemistry have motivated and equipped him pursue an independent research career in computational genomics and head and neck cancer molecular biology. The presented research aims are an outgrowth of the PI's ongoing efforts to improve RNA based methods for identifying NRF2 active head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors.  NRF2 is the key transcriptional regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, and has been related to poor patient outcome and radiation response in multiple cancer types. Mutational activation of NRF2 is observed in 8% of HPV negative (HPV-) HNSCC. However, our estimates based on RNA transcription suggest that NRF2 is aberrantly activated in 24% of HPV- HNSCC. This work has identified atypical NRF2 and CUL3 variants which are associated with NRF2 activation. The functional consequences of these variants will be investigated (Aim 1). We also find that the prohormone Neurotensin is highly expressed in NRF2 active HNSCC tumors without NRF2 pathway mutations. Our preliminary data suggest that pro-Neurotensin may activate NRF2, through a previously unreported interaction with KEAP1 (a regulator of NRF2 stability). This novel function of pro-Neurotensin will be investigated in Aim 2. Suppression of NRF2 activity is well known to radio-sensitize cancer cells. We have also identified a partially suppressed pattern of NRF2 target expression in HPV associated (HPV+) HNSCC tumors, which are highly sensitive to radiation. p14ARF is also highly expressed in HPV+ HNSCC, binds NRF2, and suppresses transactivation of some NRF2 targets. Aim 3 will explore the hypothesis that NRF2 target suppression due to high levels of p14ARF, contributes to the radio-sensitivity of these tumors.  The proposed work will be impactful for several reasons, 1) the tumor subclassification method developed address the very common problem of imperfect clinical/genomic annotations of tumor RNA expression data, 2) the first known/reported signaling role for the prohormone form of Neurotensin will be explored, and 3) identification of NRF2 targets associated with radiation response may suggest novel approaches to treatment.  UNC has exceptionally strong institutional expertise and resources related to cancer genomics. The mentorship committee also has key project specific expertise in NRF2 biology, computational genomics, p14ARF and Neurotensin. Collectively the mentorship team has previously trained four K award recipients and includes two surgeon-scientists who can provide critical career guidance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aberrant activation of the transcription factor NRF2, a key regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, is frequently seen in HPV negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is associated with a poor prognosis. Functionally validated somatic mutations of this pathway can only account for 30% of the observed activation. The objective of this proposal is to identify and characterize novel genomic and proteomic mechanisms of NRF2 activation in order to advance strategies for the diagnosis and targeted treatment of patients with NRF2 active tumors.",Mechanisms Determining Dysregulation of the NRF2 Oxidative Stress Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma,10249359,K08DE029241,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'CDKN2A gene', 'CUL3 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Faculty', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'MDM2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Mediating', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Neurotensin', 'Neurotensin Receptors', 'North Carolina', 'Otolaryngology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Primary Carcinoma', 'Prognosis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiosensitization', 'Reading Frames', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Surgeon', 'TP53 gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transactivation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'genetic signature', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oral HPV-positive head and neck cancers', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'prohormone', 'proneurotensin', 'radiation resistance', 'radiation response', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational genomics', 'treatment risk', 'tumor']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K08,2021,173993
"Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MR Fingerprinting ABSTRACT We propose to develop a fast, quantitative chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging technique, by integrating CEST with MR fingerprinting (MRF) and deep-learning techniques in a unified framework, with the ultimate goal of translation into routine clinical practice. CEST imaging is an important molecular MRI method that can generate contrast based on the proton exchange between solute labile protons and bulk water protons in tissue. Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging, a variant of CEST-based molecular MRI, is based on the amide protons (-NH) of endogenous mobile proteins and peptides in tissue. APT-MRI has been used successfully to image protein content and pH, enabling tumor grading and the differentiation of active recurrent tumor from treatment effects. However, most currently used APT imaging protocols depend on the acquisition of qualitative, so-called APT-weighted (APTw) images, limiting the detection sensitivity to quantitative parameters, such as pH or protein concentration. Currently, quantitative APT imaging is often attempted by assessing a so-called Z-spectrum, generated by measuring the normalized water signal intensity as a function of saturation frequency offset under varied radiofrequency (RF) saturation powers, which is time-consuming. Thus, the development of fast, quantitative APT imaging techniques is needed. MRF is a novel quantitative imaging method that simultaneously quantifies multiple tissue properties using pseudorandom acquisition parameters, and thus, significantly improves scan efficiency compared to conventional techniques. MRF has been successfully applied in patient studies to evaluate the range of and changes in MR relaxation times, T1 and T2, providing initial evidence of its clinical utility. Recent advances in deep neural networks open a new possibility to efficiently solve general inversion problems in MRF reconstruction, and to produce high-quality estimates of tissue parameters at high speed. Our hypothesis is that, by combining APT, MRF, and deep-learning techniques, we can highly accelerate image acquisition and accurately estimate the quantitative values of the tissue. Our hypotheses will be tested through three specific aims: 1) to develop a fast 3D APT-MRF sequence and design an optimal RF saturation schedule using deep-learning; 2) to quantify absolute amide proton concentrations and exchange rates using convolutional neural networks; and 3) to demonstrate the initial clinical utility of the technology in brain cancer, which will be confirmed by radiographically-guided stereotactic biopsy. Through quantitative APT imaging technology, a priori knowledge of the pH and protein content in gliomas may help in the stratification of patients into personalized therapeutic strategies and help monitor treatment response. NARRATIVE This research proposal is designed to optimize the speed of a novel quantitative CEST MRI technique to a clinical timeframe and to evaluate the accuracy of this technique for identifying active tumor within heterogeneous gliomas. This would allow more precise biopsy sampling of the tumor core, and differentiate active recurrent tumor from treatment effects, which could eventually help to delay or avoid surgery, e.g., where tissue sampling is only for diagnosis.",Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MR Fingerprinting,10295906,R01EB029974,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Amides', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Proposals', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'detection sensitivity', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large-scale database', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'personalized therapeutic', 'quantitative imaging', 'radio frequency', 'reconstruction', 'solute', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,360691
"Development of a web-based predictive model of nanoparticle delivery to tumors by integrating physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling with artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Many studies have shown that nanoparticle (NP)-based drug formulations are effective in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in lab animals, but the translation of animal results to clinical success is low. This is partly due to two fundamental challenges in this field, which are low delivery efficiency of NPs to the tumor and lack of a robust computational model to account for NP pharmacokinetic (PK) differences across species and thus allow one to predict tumor delivery and extrapolate the results from animals to humans. The objective of this proposal is to develop a robust, validated, and predictive generic physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for NPs in male and female tumor-bearing mice. Our hypothesis is that tissue distribution and tumor delivery of different NPs can be predicted with a generic PBPK model by training with hundreds of datasets with advanced mathematical methods, such as Bayesian-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations and/or artificial neural network (ANN) methods using species- and sex-specific physiological and NP-specific physicochemical parameters. Three specific aims were designed to achieve this objective. Aim 1: To develop a Bayesian-based robust generic PBPK model for NPs in male and female tumor-bearing mice. Aim 2: To develop a Bayesian-based robust and predictive generic PBPK model for NPs in male and female tumor-bearing mice by incorporating artificial intelligence. Aim 3: To validate and optimize the Bayesian-PBPK- ANN model with new experimental data and convert it to a web-based interface. In Aim 1, a Bayesian-MCMC method will be used to ensure model parameters are rigorously optimized and unbiased. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that incorporation of artificial intelligence methods, such as ANN will significantly improve the prediction accuracy, efficiency, and applicable domain of the Bayesian-PBPK model. In Aim 3, we will conduct PK and tissue distribution experiments in tumor-bearing mice to validate our model. Recently, we published a simple PBPK model for NPs in tumor-bearing mice and a Nano-Tumor Database that contains 376 datasets. These studies make this proposal highly feasible. This project is novel because: (1) it is a new application of Bayesian-MCMC and ANN methods in cancer nanomedicine; (2) it provides a tool to compare potential sex differences in NP tumor delivery; (3) the model will be “predictive”, which makes it different from previous studies that were mostly “correlative” analysis; and (4) the model will be converted to a web-based interface to facilitate its application to a wider audience. This project is significant since it addresses a crucial problem of low delivery efficiency of cancer nanomedicines, which has been a critical barrier to progress over the last 20 years. This project has broad impacts because it will greatly improve our fundamental understanding of the key factors of NP tumor delivery and any potential sex-dependence, and will provide a tangible tool to improve the design of NPs with higher tumor delivery efficiency to accelerate clinical translation of cancer nanomedicines from animals to humans, and also reduce/eliminate animal experimentation in nanomedicine studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the field of nanomedicine, there are many laboratory studies that have shown nanoparticle-based new drug formulations are effective in treating cancer in mice, but the translation of animal results to clinical success in humans is limited, in part, due to low delivery efficiency of nanoparticles to the tumor and lack of a robust computational model that can predict the tumor delivery efficiency of nanoparticles and extrapolate the results from animals to humans. This project is relevant to public health because the knowledge gained from the proposed research will improve our understanding of the key determinants of tissue distribution and tumor delivery of nanoparticles, which are essential for the design of effective nanomedicines. In addition, the proposed research will create a publicly available web-based interface that allows researchers to predict organ and tumor delivery efficiency of nanoparticles, thereby reducing or eliminating animal experimentation in nanomedicine studies and to accelerate clinical translation of nanoparticle-based anticancer drug formulations to benefit cancer patients.",Development of a web-based predictive model of nanoparticle delivery to tumors by integrating physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling with artificial intelligence,10180594,R01EB031022,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Artificial nanoparticles', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biodistribution', 'Breast Osteosarcoma', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Ensure', 'Excretory function', 'Experimental Designs', 'Female', 'Formulation', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Markov Chains', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sex Differences', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'absorption', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical methods', 'nano', 'nanoGold', 'nanomedicine', 'nanoparticle', 'nanoparticle delivery', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'physiologically based pharmacokinetics', 'predictive modeling', 'sex', 'species difference', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly', 'web based interface', 'zeta potential']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,343125
"OCT as a Platform for Non-Invasive Virtual H&E Biopsy The broad objective of this project is to develop imaging instrumentation and algorithmic technology to perform non-invasive, real-time, in-vivo, 3D, virtual H&E biopsies. One in four people worldwide will ultimately be affected by cancer. Surgical removal is the main treatment for most solid cancers. The surgeon is tasked with the delicate balancing act of excising enough tissue to avoid leaving behind residual cancer cells while not removing too much tissue, which can harm organ function. This is particularly important for brain tumors, the most common type of solid tumor in children and the leading cause of pediatric cancer mortality. The gold standard for detecting most solid cancers and confirming tumor margins is hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue sections, which require an invasive biopsy procedure. Unfortunately, current non-invasive in-vivo imaging modalities do not produce images of comparable usefulness. We propose a novel imaging modality called a ""virtual H&E biopsy'' that would generate H&E-like images of living tissue in real time. non-invasively up to 1 mm into the tissue. This imaging modality would be able to provide real-time diagnosis of tumor margins and invasiveness by scanning a large tissue area for residual cancer cells. Such information would guide treatment decisions for diseases such as brain and skin cancer. Beyond its clinical benefits, this technology can also be used for research into tumor development and tumor responses to treatment by providing in-vivo H&E-like images of healthy and tumorous tissue microstructures changing over time. To generate virtual H&E images, we will optimize a new imaging instrument we have developed based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and image translation by a generative adversarial neural network (GAN). The key breakthrough enabling us to train a GAN to generate virtual H&E images is a technique called optical barcoding, which we used to obtain a dataset of OCT images and corresponding real H&E images aligned to single-cell precision. We have demonstrated this virtual H&E system with ex-vivo human skin tissue samples. For the proposed project, we will first train a GAN to generate virtual H&E images of healthy mouse brain tissue and glioblastoma mouse brain tissue ex-vivo (Aim 1 ). Second, we will use transfer learning to retrain the GAN to generate virtual H&E images of mouse brain tissue of in-vivo OCT scan (Aim 2a), and track for the first time how H&E images change as a mouse glioblastoma tumor develops (Aim 2b}. Finally, we will assess whether the GAN can be retrained across species by applying transfer learning on the mouse-brain trained GAN and use it to generate a virtual H&E biopsy of ex-vivo low-grade human glioma (Aim 3). To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first time transfer learning has been applied across species for biomedical images. Such transfer learning can accelerate virtual biopsy research since mouse samples are significantly easier to obtain and handle, thereby opening up applications in locations where acquiring a human dataset for training a virtual biopsy GAN would be difficult or impossible to achieve (e.g., the retina). 8. Project Narrative We aim to develop next-generation medical imaging technologies that would allow the creation of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) biopsy-like images but without cutting the tissue and in real time. This imaging technology may provide both new basic understanding of cancer development, and clinical tools to aid in early diagnosis and tumor margin detection for better treatment management of cancer patients. As a first application, we aim to demonstrate virtual H&E biopsy on brain tumors, ultimately giving surgeons the ability to precisely determine brain tumor margins during surgery but before actually cutting into the brain.",OCT as a Platform for Non-Invasive Virtual H&E Biopsy,10254780,DP5OD031858,"['3-Dimensional', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Glioblastoma', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'COVID-19', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Department chair', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Harvest', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Industry', 'Injections', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moon', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Speaking', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residual Cancers', 'Retina', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Secure', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Solid', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'computational neuroscience', 'experience', 'high school', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'in vivo optical imaging', 'instructor', 'instrumentation', 'millimeter', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'nonhuman tissue', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'professor', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'structural biology', 'success', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'virtual', 'virtual biopsy']",OD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP5,2021,376368
"Diversity Supplement: 5P01CA118816 Project 1 PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this work is to assess the clinical value of voxel-wise predictive spatial maps of tumor heterogeneity that directly reflect histopathologically defined tumor biology. It is well known that tissue samples used for clinical diagnosis come from a relatively small portion of a vastly heterogenous lesion and are obtained infrequently during the course of the disease. Non-invasive imaging markers that are able to assess intratumoral heterogeneity and serially monitor biological properties of the tumor are critical for assessing response to therapy and directing patient care. The modalities that have shown the most promise in quantifying surrogate markers of malignant characteristics in patients with gliomas include diffusion-weighted MRI, perfusion-weighted MRI, and 1H MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). We have accumulated multi-parametric physiologic and metabolic imaging data from pre- surgical scans in order to target over 2000 tissue samples from more than 750 patients with glioma. These samples are unique in that they have each been specifically selected to target heterogeneous regions of tumor biology, including: hypoxia, proliferation, cellularity, gliosis, and malignant transformation using a combination of anatomic, physiologic, and metabolic imaging. Using this well-characterized cohort, our novel approach will leverage multi-parametric imaging features in conjunction with advanced statistical-, machine-, and deep- learning models to predict tumor biology, molecular phenotype, and progression. Aim 1 focuses on predicting intra-tumoral heterogeneity and the extent of infiltrating tumor and in newly- diagnosed glioma in order to identify areas of malignant characteristics that will direct tissue sampling for a more accurate diagnosis and predict the spatial location and characteristics of residual disease. Aim 2 will define characteristics of treatment related changes vs recurrent tumor and malignant transformation within lower grade molecular sub-groups of glioma within patients undergoing surgery for suspected tumor progression. This supplement will allow for the development and incorporation of new machine learning approaches on our existing data as well as learn the imaging features that are predictive of newly-defined molecular subgroups of glioma that are more prognostic of outcome than previously defined 2016 criteria by the World Health Organization. The result will enhance and expand current strategies for evaluating patients with glioma and provide a framework for incorporating newly identified imaging, molecular, and genomic markers that can be integrated with current response assessment criteria for evaluating standard and experimental treatments. NARRATIVE The goal of Project 1 is to assess the clinical value of combining multi-parametric imaging with novel advances in statistical modeling, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to evaluate tumor heterogeneity and identify regions at risk for tumor progression in patients with glioma. Predictive spatial maps of tumor biology will be generated using image-guided tissue samples to link anatomic, physiological and metabolic imaging parameters with histological characteristics. This approach will contribute to patient care by directing tissue sampling to make more accurate diagnoses, improving the characterization of residual disease, assisting in the planning of focal therapy, and detecting malignant progression.",Diversity Supplement: 5P01CA118816 Project 1,10381390,P01CA118816,"['Adult', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Cellularity', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Excision', 'Functional Imaging', 'Glioma', 'Gliosis', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion Weighted MRI', 'Population Statistics', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual Tumors', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tumor Biology', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'anatomic imaging', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'direct patient care', 'genomic biomarker', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular marker', 'molecular phenotype', 'multimodality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'parent grant', 'prognostic', 'response', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'statistical learning', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",P01,2021,87717
"Defining cellular states of quiescence in human brain tumors PROJECT SUMMARY The most aggressive type of brain tumor, grade IV glioma known as glioblastoma (GBM), is one of the few tumor types with both a poor outcome and minimal improvement in survival in the past decades. For GBM, like other solid cancers, intratumoral heterogeneity is likely an important factor in mediating therapeutic response. In particular, quiescent, G0-like subpopulations may engender tumors with more robust responses to treatment regimens and allow for tumor regrowth after standard of care (SOC). However, G0-like tumor populations are currently ill-defined, even after application of single cell genomics to GBM. Our failure to fully comprehend and experimentally model quiescent/G0-like states represents a critical knowledge gap, but also a key opportunity, for glioma and other cancers, as neutralizing G0 cells could effectively prevent chemoradiotherapy resistance and tumor recurrence. The purpose of this grant is to provide a functional and molecular definition of G0-like states in GBM tumors and their responses to SOC. In Aim 1, we will define molecular networks governing long- and short-term quiescent states in GBM patient tumors using a novel G0 reporter system in combination with single cell genomic analysis. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that dormant G0 GBM cells have unique RNA and chromatin signatures required for SOC survival and tumor regrowth. In Aim 3, we will study and nominate the NuA4/KAT5 lysine acetyltransferase complex as a key regulator of G0-like states in GBM and candidate therapeutic target. The Aims are built on strong preliminary data, including: the creation of a machine learning-based method for identifying G0-like cells in gliomas, integrated analysis of single cell RNA and chromatin analysis of primary and PDX GBM tumors with standard of care, a functional genomic screen to identify regulators of GBM G0, and key experimental models to functionally dissect G0 states in GBM tumor models. If successful, this grant will produce a new working model for GBM G0-like states, provide key genes and gene networks associated with G0, and analysis tools for identifying G0-like states in clinical samples. It will also define how these populations respond to SOC and shift tumor dynamics during recurrence. Finally, it will provide data for a new therapeutic strategy, ""downgrading"", where grade IV tumors are made less aggressive by triggering extended or permanent G0-like states in tumor cells. NARRATIVE Solid tumor recurrence is likely driven by slow dividing or quiescent tumor subpopulations in the primary tumor which survive treatment regimens and give rise to secondary tumors. However, we currently lack a basic understanding of molecular features of these populations and, as a result, do not have effective therapeutic strategies to neutralize them. The experiments described in this proposal are directly relevant to public health because they will identify and dissect molecular vulnerabilities that can eliminate tumor subpopulations resistant to conventional therapies.",Defining cellular states of quiescence in human brain tumors,10101272,R01NS119650,"['Acetyltransferase', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adopted', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cancer Model', 'Caring', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Experimental Models', 'Failure', 'G0 Phase', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Grant', 'HTATIP gene', 'Human', 'Indolent', 'Knowledge', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mitosis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Solid', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'chemoradiation', 'conventional therapy', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'neoplasm resource', 'neoplastic cell', 'neurogenesis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'prevent', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'standard of care', 'stem-like cell', 'temozolomide', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'therapeutically effective', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NINDS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,553130
"Towards a Virtual Biopsy: An improved multimodal imaging biomarker to guide treatment decisions in neuro-oncology by combining advanced tissue microstructure imaging with deep learning Project Summary/Abstract Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the prognosis for neuro- oncology patients remains poor, with a mean survival of 12-15 months for high-grade gliomas. One major reason for poor survival is that it remains difficult to accurately assess tumor progression and treatment-related changes on standard imaging. This limits necessary information for guiding biopsies or resecting malignant tissue. In addition, new therapies can cause radiological patterns that obfuscate the underlying course of the disease. As a result, there is a critical need for new quantitative imaging tools to evaluate brain tumors and their progression. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel quantitative imaging biomarkers using the combination of advanced tissue microstructure imaging and deep learning to accurately discriminate tumor from non-tumor tissue, measure tumor progression and treatment response, and predict clinical outcomes. This approach utilizes restricted spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion-weighted imaging technique that models the restricted diffusion of water to improve tumor conspicuity. Phase I of this proposal will develop a hybrid multimodal, RSI-based biomarker for brain cancer, quantify the biomarker in abnormal sub-regions, and demonstrate the biomarker’s performance in predicting clinical outcomes. Phase II of this proposal will develop and deploy commercial-grade software to the CorTechs Labs cloud platform, demonstrate its clinical usability and utility, and generate the materials required for a 510K FDA submission. The AI technology developed through this proposal will ultimately serve as a clinical decision support tool to improve clinician performance in diagnosing and evaluating brain tumors and predicting tumor response to treatment. Project Narrative Quantitative biomarkers that can better delineate tumor from non-tumor tissue including radiation injury are essential for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of treatment response in neuro-oncology patients. The goal of this proposal is to develop an automated AI-based commercial software tool that is predictive of clinical outcomes including treatment response, progression and survival. This approach utilizes a novel combination of restricted spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion-weighted MRI technique for probing tissue microstructure, and deep learning to integrate RSI microstructure data with multimodal imaging data.",Towards a Virtual Biopsy: An improved multimodal imaging biomarker to guide treatment decisions in neuro-oncology by combining advanced tissue microstructure imaging with deep learning,10325327,R44NS120796,"['3-Dimensional', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In complete remission', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Production', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Injuries', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Stable Disease', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'biomarker performance', 'brain tumor imaging', 'cancer clinical trial', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cloud platform', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'neural network classifier', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'partial response', 'patient stratification', 'potential biomarker', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'serial imaging', 'software development', 'spectrograph', 'support tools', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'usability', 'validation studies', 'virtual biopsy', 'water diffusion']",NINDS,"CORTECHS LABS, INC.",R44,2021,254685
"Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response Abstract  The continuing goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective imaging-based strategies to personalize brain tumor treatment. Current Response Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) criteria, which incorporate anatomic imaging only, are insufficient for distinguishing tumor from treatment effect (TE). Without definitive confirmation of tumor progression, no treatment changes are recommended for several months after standard therapies. Thus, patients are precluded from switching to potentially more effective therapies—a limitation that could be overcome with more reliable imaging techniques.  To this end, during the previous funding cycle, we demonstrated the feasibility of several quantitative imaging (QI) tools to reliably distinguish tumor from treatment effect and predict treatment response. These QI tools include a machine-learning approach to calibrate T1w images enabling the creation of quantitative delta T1 (qDT1) maps. The qDT1 enable the detection of true contrast enhancing lesion volume (CELV). The qDT1 together with our proven dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI methods, for determination of rCBV (relative cerebral blood volume), are used to generate a new biomarker, fractional tumor burden (FTB), to delineate the extent of tumor within CELV on a voxel-wise basis. These perfusion-based QI tools in combination with our diffusion MRI technology, which includes functional diffusion maps (FDMs) and more recently RSI (restriction spectrum imaging), provide a comprehensive assessment of brain tumor and its distinction from treatment effect.  Now, in order to translate this technology for use in clinical trials and daily practice, some final updates and clinical validation studies are needed as proposed here. First, to ease adoption and testing in the clinical setting improvements are proposed for the individual QI technologies along with the development of a streamlined workflow (Aim 1). To improve the widespread adoption of DSC-MRI and FTB biomarker, studies will be performed to confirm that a single-dose DSC-MRI method can replace the standard double-dose method without affecting the accuracy of rCBV or the creation of FTB maps (Aim 1.1). Also, registration and segmentation algorithms will be updated to include deformable registration and recent advances in deep learning for longitudinal reporting of CELV, non-enhancing lesion volumes (NELV) and each of the QI metrics (Aim 1.2). Finally, a streamlined workflow that incorporates these improvements will be created (Aim 1.3). The Aim 2 studies will test the QI tools and workflow using clinical trial data (Aim 2.1-2.2) and daily clinical practice (Aim 2.3-2.4).  Clinical validation of this new QI-RANO workflow, with evidence showing improved prediction in comparison to current measures, has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how brain tumor burden is assessed. Project Narrative The goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective quantitative imaging (QI)-based strategies to provide earlier indications of brain tumor treatment response than is currently available. The QI tools, which include novel quantitative measures of enhancing lesion (qDT1), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), fractional tumor burden (FTB) and functional diffusion maps (fDM) will be updated and validated in the context of clinical trials. Working in close collaboration with an industrial partner, the proven methods will be translated into a software platform for widespread use within the quantitative imaging network (QIN), and for both clinical trials and daily standard of care.",Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response,10250327,U01CA176110,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Funding', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predisposition', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Update', 'Validation', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cerebral blood volume', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'validation studies']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,U01,2021,537154
"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer,10070579,R01CA210509,"['Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'BRAF gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infiltration', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Invasion', 'Supervision', 'TNM', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'prognostic', 'prognostic model', 'prognostic signature', 'supervised learning', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,407754
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks.

"An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oregon Health & Science University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have worked over the past decade to develop ex vivo drug profiling to guide a rationale decision-making in assigning drugs to cancer patients, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. A number of recent breakthroughs, many developed through our partnership, have dramatically improved on nearly all aspects of ex vivo drug testing. Our work to date has led to numerous compassionate-use cases as well as new investigator initiated clinical trials. Recognizing the broad utility for a clinic-friendly ex vivo drug sensitivity platform, we set up a commercial entity, SEngine Precision Medicine, whose mission is to provide functional testing of patient derived tumor cells for research, clinical studies, and drug development. Here we seek to move beyond proof of concept in the assay toward wider adoption by cancer research centers, community hospitals, and individual users. We will benchmark the assay’s predictive performance in both “N of 1” settings and in prospective observational studies, and use this baseline performance to drive the development of methods to further improve its predictive value. We will continue to optimize drug selection by integrating ex vivo drug testing with patient specific genomic profiling and clinical data. In parallel, we will develop a reporting system, based upon requirements analysis, for potential end users such as clinicians and academic research centers. OHSU will provide expertise in precision medicine for AML, functional testing of primary leukemia cells, and clinical trials and will assist with assay optimization. FHCRC will provide expertise in functional testing of cells derived from solid tumors, focusing first on breast cancer, cancer genomics, and clinical trials; and will assist with assay optimization and benchmarking. SEngine will develop CLIA certified assays, optimize sample analysis workflows, and develop a reporting system for end users. All three sites will work together to demonstrate inter-institutional proficiency of the assays. At least five additional academic centers have agreed to provide patient derived tumor cells for this project and we anticipate this number will increase during the granting period. The partnering institutions will also provide essential feedback for our performance and reporting system. Our end goals for this project are to produce a refined functional genomic platform based on ex vivo drug screens, a user-friendly reporting interface, and adoption of the technology in the clinical care decision-making process. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ability to provide effective therapy recommendations to cancer patients is limited by our capacity to predict which drugs will work for a given patient. Our platform overcomes this limitation by testing a set of available anti- cancer drugs on tumor cells cultured directly from cancer patients. Through an extensive academic/industry partnership, we propose to refine and benchmark this platform, improve its predictive power, and provide a user- friendly reporting interface to facilitate its adoption by cancer care providers.  ",An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology.,10049232,R01CA214428,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'CLIA certified', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computational Biology', 'Cultured Tumor Cells', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Designer Drugs', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Economics', 'Feedback', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Sciences', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Observational Study', 'Oregon', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer genomics', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'data integration', 'drug development', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'user-friendly']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,599950
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue.

"Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncus’ Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients. If successful, this work will considerably expand the range of patients with lung tumors that can be treated with a cost-effective, minimally-invasive approach. PROJECT NARRATIVE Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive treatment option for thermal destruction of tumors, that is in clinical use for treating tumors in the lung with a percutaneous approach.

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,10411429,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'patient stratification', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2021,166000

"Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer The goal of this research is to clinically translate software tools we developed through the Quantitative Imaging Network and validate their ability to assess the response of cancer in clinical trials. Current RECIST response criteria are inadequate to detect tumor changes in targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies, two of the most promising avenues for drug discovery. We hypothesize that innovative volumetric and radiomics signatures of response and progression, identified using our quantitative CT imaging tools, can be integrated into clinical trial workflow to meet the urgent need for alternatives to RECIST criteria. Two large multi-site trials present a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in one disease treated with multiple therapeutic options driven by tissue biomarkers. S0819 is a completed Phase III trial with 1300+ patients and Lung- MAP (S1400) is an ongoing first-of-its-kind Phase II/III model projected to enroll up to 5,000 patients using a multi-drug, targeted screening approach to match patients with sub-studies testing investigational treatments based on their unique tumor profiles. Aim 1 tests whether change in tumor volume over time, measured by our advanced volumetric segmentation algorithms, outperforms unidimensional RECIST 1.1 response criteria. Aim 2 correlates genomic mutations identified in S0819 and Lung-MAP with radiomics signatures constructed by our machine learning models, with the goal of developing a non-invasive, easily repeatable virtual biopsy through CT imaging. Aim 3 validates the prediction of clinical outcomes using early biomarkers of response and progression based on quantitative CT-based radiomic features, hypothesized to outperform both RECIST and volumetrics alone across therapeutic options including chemotherapies, targeted molecular agents, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our work has substantial health significance because validation of volume and radiomic changes as early biomarkers of response or progression will guide clinical trials for drug discovery and help match patients to personalized treatment. Response criteria developed through this study will be widely applicable to clinical practice because CT is the most common cancer imaging modality and the quantitative image analysis tools can easily be incorporated into existing popular imaging platforms and clinical workflow, reducing the time required by radiologists. Data from this project, including anonymized imaging data (CT for all patients and PET for a large subset), clinical meta- data, and lesion mark-ups by independent radiologists, will be shared for use by other researchers through the TCGA Cancer Imaging Archive, continuing an extensive history of data sharing by this team. This work will improve drug discovery for promising new classes of therapies by creating innovative response criteria based on volumetric and radiomics signatures developed with prior support by the QIN and now validated in two large multi-site clinical trials studying multiple therapeutic options in the most important histologic types of lung cancer and most commonly used imaging modality, CT. Results are expected to be applied to other tumor types and help match patients to the treatment that works best for them.","Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer",10177883,U01CA225431,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carboplatin', 'Cetuximab', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunotherapy', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paclitaxel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Cancer Imaging Archive', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'drug discovery', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'genomic signature', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'mutant', 'mutational status', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2021,609495
"Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy ABSTRACT Years of clinical experience and a growing body of basic research suggest that chemotherapeutic activity can change with time-of-day. But when should our patients take their medicines? Must we test each new agent for circadian modulation in both efficacy and toxicity? Which tumors are most sensitive to chemotherapy administration time? Can we tailor our recommendations for individual patients? Temporal variation in the abundance of drug targets, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes, in both tumors and normal tissues, underlies circadian variation in drug activity. Until recently almost all we knew about tissue specific circadian rhythms came from normal mice. Without human data, a mechanistic, hypothesis-driven transition to medical practice has been slow. Recently we developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure) a machine-learning algorithm to uncover human transcriptional oscillations using existing, unordered biopsy samples. We used CYCLOPS to explore circadian rhythms in human lung and liver, identify disrupted rhythms in hepatocellular carcinoma, and predict circadian changes in drug effectiveness. This proposal will greatly expand that work and accelerate its translation to clinical oncology. Using public data, we will describe the molecular rhythms in an array of normal human tissues and thus the times of day when these tissues are least sensitive to specific drug toxicities. We will also describe rhythms in select tumors, identifying circadian times and cell cycle phases when cancers are most distinct from surrounding tissue and thus uniquely sensitive to various treatments. We will explore the influence of specific mutations and tumor markers on the rhythms observed in patients. Mapping these data onto pharmacogenomics databases we can make testable prediction as to the drugs and side effects most influenced by circadian time. Finally using both experimental mouse data and our preliminary human results, we have compiled a list of some of the most promising chronotheraputic candidates. We will expand and refine this list over the course of the study, testing several of these predictions in established animal models, and exploring the promise and practical principles of cancer chronotherapy. Taken together these aims will help catalyze chronotheraputic translation to clinical oncology and help delineate the role of time in precision cancer therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. The influence of daily rhythms on cancer biology and treatment is particularly strong.

"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,10159875,R00CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'refractory cancer', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R00,2021,153920
"(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy This proposal combines a team with expertise in aging, tumor immunology, tumor immunotherapy, specific genetically modified animal models and early phase clinical trials with a computational team having great expertise in analyzing and modeling aging of the immune system. We will study age effects on PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in the host and the tumor focusing on melanoma with some bladder cancer work, two tumors that are highly responsive to αPD-1 and/or αPD-L1 as proofs-of-concept, and residing in distinct anatomic compartments. In Aim 1 we study tumor PD-L1 intrinsic effects on αPD-L1 and αPD-1 treatment in melanoma and bladder cancer using transplantable B16 and inducible Nras/Cdk2n melanoma models, and transplantable MB49 and BBN-induced tumors for bladder cancer studies. We also use novel melanoma and BC models with tumor cell- specific PD-L1KO. We study 3 cohorts of elderly versus younger humans getting αPD-L1 or αPD-1 for melanoma or bladder cancer for human validation. We measure high-dimensional cell phenotypes and signaling responses, proteins and genes to maximize the information collected from human samples and mice using 23-color FACS, CyTOF, Luminex, Nanostring and other approaches. In Aim 2 we use all the above models and analytic strategies in young and aged PD-L1KO mice and WT or bone marrow chimeras to test hematopoietic and non- hematopoietic (host) PD-L1 signals in treatment outcomes in melanoma and bladder cancer. In Aim 3 the Systems Immunology team will use their innovative and successful computational modeling to identify age- related co-predictors of immunotherapy response and to identify candidate mechanisms for responders and non- responders. We will define a trajectory of immune system aging in mice at ultra-high resolution by performing a systems level integrative analysis of aging in Collaborative Cross and BL6 mice tracked in a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional study. This trajectory will be used to understand how tumor response and treatment outcomes vary as a function of age, and to build a simple, low parameter (i.e., easily testable and clinically translated), predictive models of treatment response. We will test insights by analyzing immune data from aged versus young patients undergoing αPD-L1 and αPD-1 cancer immunotherapy in novel machine learning approaches that we pioneered to identify insights from mouse data that are relevant to humans. Coupling this disease information with the healthy human aging trajectory that we recently defined will allow us to adapt our mouse data to predict optimal treatments in humans based on chronological and immune aging. This combined trans-disciplinary approach will identify common age-related disabilities that reduce PD-L1/PD-1 based immunotherapy responses and suggest tailored treatments for optimal efficacy that could later be tested in validation sets.

"(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy This proposal combines a team with expertise in aging, tumor immunology, tumor immunotherapy, specific genetically modified animal models and early phase clinical trials with a computational team having great expertise in analyzing and modeling aging of the immune system. We will study age effects on PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in the host and the tumor focusing on melanoma with some bladder cancer work, two tumors that are highly responsive to αPD-1 and/or αPD-L1 as proofs-of-concept, and residing in distinct anatomic compartments. In Aim 1 we study tumor PD-L1 intrinsic effects on αPD-L1 and αPD-1 treatment in melanoma and bladder cancer using transplantable B16 and inducible Nras/Cdk2n melanoma models, and transplantable MB49 and BBN-induced tumors for bladder cancer studies. We also use novel melanoma and BC models with tumor cell- specific PD-L1KO. We study 3 cohorts of elderly versus younger humans getting αPD-L1 or αPD-1 for melanoma or bladder cancer for human validation. We measure high-dimensional cell phenotypes and signaling responses, proteins and genes to maximize the information collected from human samples and mice using 23-color FACS, CyTOF, Luminex, Nanostring and other approaches. In Aim 2 we use all the above models and analytic strategies in young and aged PD-L1KO mice and WT or bone marrow chimeras to test hematopoietic and non- hematopoietic (host) PD-L1 signals in treatment outcomes in melanoma and bladder cancer. In Aim 3 the Systems Immunology team will use their innovative and successful computational modeling to identify age- related co-predictors of immunotherapy response and to identify candidate mechanisms for responders and non- responders. We will define a trajectory of immune system aging in mice at ultra-high resolution by performing a systems level integrative analysis of aging in Collaborative Cross and BL6 mice tracked in a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional study. This trajectory will be used to understand how tumor response and treatment outcomes vary as a function of age, and to build a simple, low parameter (i.e., easily testable and clinically translated), predictive models of treatment response. We will test insights by analyzing immune data from aged versus young patients undergoing αPD-L1 and αPD-1 cancer immunotherapy in novel machine learning approaches that we pioneered to identify insights from mouse data that are relevant to humans. Coupling this disease information with the healthy human aging trajectory that we recently defined will allow us to adapt our mouse data to predict optimal treatments in humans based on chronological and immune aging. This combined trans-disciplinary approach will identify common age-related disabilities that reduce PD-L1/PD-1 based immunotherapy responses and suggest tailored treatments for optimal efficacy that could later be tested in validation sets. These data can also be applied to other types of immunotherapy as we will also test. Cancer is a disease of the aged, but therapies are generally modeled in the young.

"Multimodal Biomarkers For Oropharyngeal Cancer Abstract Head and neck cancers are the fifth most common cancer type in the United States, with an overall survival rate lower than 50%. Although the incidence of other sub-sites of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in past decades, the number of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) cases has increased significantly. Most OPSCC patients receive standard cancer therapy.4 However, the clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Predicting early in treatment whether a tumor is likely to respond to treatment is one of the most difficult yet important tasks in providing individualized cancer care.  Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known driving oncogenic factor in oropharyngeal cancer, as well as a significant prognostic biomarker for patient survival. Retrospective studies conducted by the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium (INHANCE) have demonstrated that clinical biomarkers have prognostic value in helping stratify OPSCC patients into groups with differing risks of death or disease progression. However, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients have similar rates of metastatic spread to HPV-negative patients. The same is true for patient groups stratified with other clinical biomarkers. More robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for optimally effective treatment.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Multiple studies indicate that miRNAs are promising cancer biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in oropharyngeal cancer. Imaging features extracted from medical images are an exciting new class of cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habitats. For several tumor sites, imaging biomarkers have shown promise in accurately separating favorable and unfavorable prognosis patients. However, current efforts to utilize high-dimensional multimodal biomarkers for treatment outcome prediction have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; feature redundancy, heterogeneity, and uncertainty; and patient cohorts with unbalanced outcomes. The correlation, independence, and complementary nature of multimodal biomarkers (imaging, miRNA, HPV, clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers) remains unexplored as well.  The major goal of this research is to develop a multimodal biomarker-based model that can reliably predict subsets of OPSCC patients with low and high risks for treatment failure. The model will serve as a clinical decision-making tool. Specifically, we propose a novel principle and systematic machine learning-based strategy to effectively identify and seamlessly combine prognostic information carried by multimodal biomarkers. Aim 1: Identify prognostic multimodal biomarkers, given OPSCC patient data. Aim 2: Develop and test a comprehensive multimodal biomarker-based model for predicting OPSCC treatment outcomes. Aim 3: Assess the clinical benefit of the model for OPSCC patient stratification and individualized treatment. Narrative The achievement of this project forms a basis of combining non-invasive imaging biomarkers with miRNAs, HPV, clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers for accurate cancer prognosis and discovering the correlation with genetic mechanisms leading to specific tumor phenotypes. This clinical decision-making tool can provide useful information to support patient stratification and individualized treatment. We anticipate that many of the methodological improvements established in this proposal will improve oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treatment and tumor response assessment and treatment in other disease sites as well.",Multimodal Biomarkers For Oropharyngeal Cancer,10204964,R01CA233873,"['Achievement', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognosis', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic model', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,396448
"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling. Our investigative team has combined expertise in computational methodology immunotherapy. immunology and big data mining, functional genomics profiling Our proposed studies, if successfully executed, and translational benefits to cancer immunotherapy. and screening, cancer immunology and could provide new insights into cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have emerged over the last decade as highly promising approaches for cancer treatment, although only subsets of patients respond to immunotherapies.

"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.

"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,10229579,K08CA234458,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CTLA4 blockade', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'driver mutation', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K08,2021,250795
"Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most frequent tumors in men. Despite recent progress, the disease is still incurable once resistance to castration therapy occurs. Tumor progression is strongly mediated by altered molecular exchanges between cancer cells and the surrounding milieu that originate at the primary sites. However, the mechanisms regulating the response of the stroma to the tumor, which ultimately promote PC progression are still largely unknown. Our laboratory discovered a new type of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV), which are referred to as “large oncosomes” (LO), can harbor more abundant molecular cargo that is distinct and more potently bioactive than that carried by exosomes. The rationale for this proposal derives from our preliminary observations in patients that LO abundance in the circulation correlates with PC progression. Our functional data demonstrate that LO can activate oncogenic signaling in fibroblasts, which respond to LO uptake by activating MYC and SPI1 and by induce a transcriptional program that promotes angiogenesis and stimulates tumor growth. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the functional role of LO in PC progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that LO functionally reprogram normal prostate-associated fibroblasts (NAF) toward a phenotype that is driven by MYC and SPI1 activation. These results strongly suggest that tumor-derived LO might activate intercellular responses that are specific to this subtype of extracellular vesicle. Our hypothesis will be tested with three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of LO-induced fibroblast activation in PC progression. Aim 2: To find evidence that the LO- induced transcriptional program is active in PC patients with clinically significant disease. Aim 3: To test if LO and/or Exo derived from PC patient and PDX specimens promote castration resistance and/or bone metastasis. We will use a combination of complementary in vitro and animal orthotopic models as well as focused approaches involving genome editing, molecular barcodes, and a Cre-Lox reporter in vivo system. Our study will determine if the transcriptional program induced by LO in vitro drives tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. Additionally we will determine if this transcriptional program can also be identified in patient specimens and if it indicative of tumor progression. Finally, our study will provide evidence for LO abilities to induce metastasis of indolent PC cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will perform functional tests of a newly-identified class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle, referred to as large oncosomes. These shed vesicles are products of metastatic prostate cancer cells and we have obtained evidence that they are potent effectors of conditioning of the tumor microenvironment in a manner that promotes disease progression. Here we will examine their potential role in stroma-supported tumor progression and metastasis and the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process.",Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis,10237240,R01CA234557,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Bone Marrow', 'COL1A2 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cancer Patient', 'Castration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chick', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cre-LoxP', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelium', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Indolent', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Oncogenic', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'SPI1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'androgen sensitive', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'castration resistant prostate cancer', 'cell stroma', 'clinically significant', 'conditioning', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome editing', 'host neoplasm interaction', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intercellular communication', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'molecular oncology', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'prostate cancer metastasis', 'prostate cancer model', 'prostate cancer progression', 'response', 'trafficking', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,484694
"Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials Project Summary / Abstract In patients with lymphomas and other cancers, quantitative evaluation of the extent of tumor burden is im- portant for staging, restaging, and assessment of therapeutic response or relapse; yet measurement of overall tumor burden is challenging with current tools, particularly when lymph nodes are confluent or difficult to fully differentiate from surrounding structures. Precision medicine and novel therapeutics are emphasizing the need to introduce a risk-adapted approach to tailor appropriate treatment strategies for cancer patients. The ability to quantitatively assess cancer phenotypes with functional and anatomical imaging that could efficiently and ac- curately map patients to gene expression profiling, clinical information, matching cohorts, and novel treatment regimens could potentially result in more optimal management of patients with cancer.  This Academic-Industry Partnership aims to translate recently developed technologies for semi- automated image segmentation and quantification of lymph nodes into robust tools and integrate them into an existing cloud-based system for management of multicenter oncology clinical trials. The ability to semi- automatically segment lymph node pathology with computed tomography (CT), as well as quantify nodal me- tabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) will enable comprehensive tracking of morphological and functional changes related to disease progression and treatment response.  Since 2004, the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center's (DF/HCC) Tumor Imaging Metrics Core (TIMC) has developed the Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC (PIM) platform to manage clinical trial image assessment workflows. Currently, there are nearly 50,000 consistently measured lymph node measurements in the TIMC database. The PIM system is used to make over 20,000 time point imaging assessments per year at eight NCI- designated Cancer Centers and aims to grow quickly by transitioning to a fully cloud-hosted system.  Given sufficient training data, state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technolo- gies can meet or even exceed human performance on specific imaging analysis tasks. Recent studies have indicated that AI-based lymph node segmentation from CT scans is nearing human performance levels, and we will extend and translate this work into a commercial tool. Specifically, our aim is to translate recent ad- vancements in AI-based segmentation into deployable services, and integrate these services into the clinical trial workflow. The proposed system will be designed to incorporate expert feedback provided by image ana- lysts and radiologists back into the ground truth dataset, allowing for continuous improvement in accuracy and clinical acceptance. We will extend our semi-automatic CT segmentation technologies to quantify lymph node metabolism in PET/CT, using lymphoma as the model disease.

"A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials Project Summary/Abstract There has been a shift to greater use of neadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in the clinical management of cancer. Often used in breast cancer to provide systemic treatment for possible or apparent metastatic disease, NACT also reduces the primary tumor size and facilitates breast conservation. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is an effective diagnostic for monitoring tumor regression. There are many methodologies being developed for monitoring cancer in vivo, including contrast agent washout, volumetry, and more recently correlating apparent diffusion coefficients and proton relaxation times to tumor staging. Such imaging biomarkers are predictive of the pathological complete response (pCR) outcome prior to surgery. This enables physicians to provide “evidence based” treatment modifications to reduce deleterious side effects and improve patient outcomes. To obtain quantitative data from MR images, the variations that occur in imaging as a result of hardware and software differences between MRI manufacturers and day-to-day operations must be quantified. In MRI, the data depends on the protocols used to acquire the image, resulting in inconsistencies if even one parameter in the protocol changes. The goal of the proposed work is to produce and develop and disseminate a ground truth physical standard and quality control program for comparison of MRI scanners in the multisite I-SPY2 (ACRIN 6698) trials monitoring pre-operative chemotherapy treatments in the reduction of tumor size. The physical standard is an anthropomorphic breast phantom capable of fitting into all commercial breast coils. It contains novel human tissue mimics and geometric standards with values traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Analysis software capable of protocol compliance checks, rapid identification of the regions of interest, and comparison to ground truth values as measured by NIST will be developed to complement the physical standard. This will enable qualification of sites and quantification of error resulting from scanner performance alone. Given the wide breadth of parameter space that MRI protocols encompass, part of the proposed effort will include the development of protocols specific to image acquisition of tumor volumes and for measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient within the tumor volumes as compared to surrounding healthy tissue. Project Narrative: Quantitative imaging complements precision medicine initiatives by providing a noninvasive method of monitoring gene specific in vivo treatment of diseases ranging from cancer to neurological disorders. To realize quantitative imaging, variations in imaging hardware, software, and procedures must be mitigated. This project will develop a quality assurance and quality control procedure for multisite clinical trials involved in monitoring therapeutic efficacy using MR breast imaging.",A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials,10244956,R44CA235820,"['Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Breast', 'Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Breast conservation', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diffusion', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Volume', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cloud based', 'computer aided detection', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'human tissue', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'nervous system disorder', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'operation', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'quality assurance', 'quantitative imaging', 'side effect', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,"CALIBERMRI, INC.",R44,2021,472890
"Quantitative MRI for Pediatric Optic Pathway Glioma Treatment Response ABSTRACT  Low-grade glioma is the most common brain tumor in children and often involves one or more structures of the anterior visual pathway (i.e., optic nerves, chiasm and tracts). Nearly 20% of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) will develop a low-grade glioma of the anterior visual pathway, which are called optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). NF1-OPGs are not amenable to surgical resection and can cause permanent vision loss ranging from a mild decline in visual acuity to complete blindness. Children with NF1-OPGs typically experience vision loss between 1 and 8 years of age and are monitored with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess disease progression. However, traditional two-dimensional (2D) measures of tumor size are not appropriate to assess change over time and how NF1-OPGs are responding to treatment.  Our proposal addresses the lack of robust and standardized quantitative imaging (QI) tools and methods needed for NF1-OPG clinical trials. We will develop and validate a novel three-dimensional (3D) MRI-based QI application for automated and comprehensive quantification of these unique pediatric tumors. We will use machine learning algorithms to accommodate MRI sequences from different manufacturers and protocols. We hypothesize that the novel QI application will accurately assess treatment response in clinical trials. In this project, we will validate our QI software and machine learning methods to make accurate and automated measures of tumor volume and shape using data from a phase 3 clinical trial of NF1-OPGs. From these measures, we will create methods to assess response to therapy that will enable physicians to make informed and objective treatment decisions.  Our specific aims are: 1) Develop a comprehensive QI application to perform accurate automated quantification of NF1-OPGs; 2) Determine and predict treatment response using our 3D QI measures of tumor volume; and 3) Validate our 3D QI measures using visual acuity outcomes.  Upon study completion, our QI application could transform clinical care for NF1-OPG by identifying the earliest time to determine a favorable versus unfavorable treatment response. The QI application's ability to accurately measure treatment response, along with harmonizing data across MRI manufacturers and protocols, will standardize imaging assessments essential to NF1-OPG clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In children with brain tumors impacting their vision, physicians have difficulty determining when the treatment is working. We will improve upon the very basic and often inaccurate human measurements of tumor size by developing quantitative imaging tools to make accurate and automated measures of tumor volume and shape. From these measures, we will create methods that will enable clinical trials and physicians to make informed decisions about the treatment’s success and whether the child will recover their vision.",Quantitative MRI for Pediatric Optic Pathway Glioma Treatment Response,10197029,UG3CA236536,"['3-Dimensional', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Brain Neoplasm', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complete Blindness', 'Data', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Chiasm', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Glioma', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor Volume', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Pathways', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer predisposition', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCI,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,UG3,2021,446107
"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,10137898,R01CA236793,"['Benign', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'radiologist', 'tumor', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,311975
"Pathogenesis of the cART unresponsive Kaposi’s sarcoma tumor niche Abstract Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) is the most common AIDS-defining cancer. Combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) has greatly reduced KS-associated mortality among AIDS patients; however, a serous clinical problem exists in that up to 50% of HIV+KS+ patients in the United States and 61% in Sub-Saharan Africa never achieve complete remission even with chemotherapy and a reduction in HIV viral loads. No definitive study has identified if there are tumor-associated features or mechanisms are associated with cART-progressive KS (progressors) vs. the responder (responders) phenotype. Our study utilizes a robust pre-cART KS tissue collection (n = 224) from the ACSR that originated from the Antiretrovirals for Kaposi's Sarcoma (ARKS) clinical trial. 36% of ARKS participants experienced continued progression of KS despite a reduction in viral loads and restored T-cell counts, in contrast to the rest of the cohort who experienced a reduction or elimination of tumors by the 1-year trial endpoint. This application poses several hypotheses concerning the progressor phenotype: 1) prior to the initiation of cART, an increase in HIV and/or KSHV-infected immune cells enhances a stimulatory immunological profile in the progressor phenotype, 2) there are significant differences in the upregulation of KSHV lytic and immunomodulation genes, which stimulate increased immune cell recruitment into the pre-cART tumor microenvironment and promote tumor progression through cytokine-signaling inflammatory processes enhanced in part by the cART-revitalized immune system, 3) the highly inflammatory nature of KS tumors, comprising a complex mixture of immune cells with which to interact, selects for unique and/or elusive HIV genotypes, distinct from plasma HIV, that promote stimulatory processes to continue in the progressor phenotype. Our Specific Aims address these hypotheses using a combination of advanced immunohistochemistry, virus specific cellular localization (DNA and RNAscope), high-throughput gene expression analysis (RNAseq), and a novel deep sequencing approach applied to HIV. Innovations include the unprecedented amount pre-cART KS tumor material available for the study, advanced imagining technologies, in vivo KS tumors gene expression studies, the use of the newer PacBio SMRT sequencing approach applied to HIV, and machine-learning approaches that can define non-linear associations in complex data sets. This project will define the largest well-characterized set of combinatorial features related to cART-associated KS outcomes derived directly from KS-associated biomaterial. Identifying clinically relevant immune factors in the tumor niche pre-cART will pave the way for the development of future mechanistic studies on the functions of both viral and cellular genes that are involved in cART resistant tumor progression. Project Narrative Combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) successfully reduces the risk of progressive Kaposi's sarcoma in the majority of HIV infected people; however, up to 50% of those treated will never retrieve remission, even when viral loads are reduced and the immune system is restored. In this project we will to determine the pre-cART tumor features that identify the progressor phenotype. With the ability to differentiate between the progressor and responder outcome categories, a simple biopsy prior to cART could elucidate a better combinatorial treatment approach.",Pathogenesis of the cART unresponsive Kaposi’s sarcoma tumor niche,10245125,R01CA239263,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bar Codes', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'CD3 Antigens', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Growth Factor', 'HIV', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 8', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologics', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammatory', 'Kaposi Sarcoma', 'Lytic Virus', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Physical environment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Process', 'RNA', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serous', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Tropism', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'complex data', 'cytokine', 'deep sequencing', 'detection assay', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'immunoregulation', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'novel', 'recruit', 'single molecule real time sequencing', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,566972
"IMAGING TELOMERE MAINTENANCE MECHANISMS IN GLIOMAS PROJECT SUMMARY All tumors, including gliomas, need a telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM) in order to proliferate indefinitely and TMMs are, therefore, considered hallmarks of cancer. Primary glioblastomas and low-grade oligodendrogliomas use reactivation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression as their TMM while low-grade astrocytomas use the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Due to their essential nature, TERT and ALT are attractive therapeutic targets and, interestingly, studies indicate that TERT inhibition can lead to resistance by induction of the ALT pathway. Our goal is to identify novel, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-detectable metabolic biomarkers of TERT and ALT in gliomas that will enable non-invasive imaging of tumor burden and response to therapy. Our scientific premise is that prior studies as well as our preliminary data, indicate that TERT and ALT are associated with significant metabolic reprogramming, resulting in unique MRS-detectable metabolic signatures of TMM status. Our specific aims are as follows: Aim 1- to identify non-invasive 1H- and hyperpolarized 13C-MRS-based imaging biomarkers of TMM status in genetically-engineered and patient-derived glioma cells; Aim 2- to determine the utility of 1H- and hyperpolarized 13C- MRS for metabolic imaging of TMM status in orthotopic glioma xenografts in vivo; Aim 3: to mechanistically validate our imaging biomarkers by identifying the molecular mechanisms by which TERT and ALT alter metabolism in gliomas. This proposal is innovative because: 1) although TMM have been linked to metabolic reprogramming, we are the first to propose to exploit this link for non-invasive imaging 2) we have access to unique genetically-engineered and patient- derived glioma models that differ in TMM status 3) we propose to use unbiased principal component analysis to identify TMM-linked metabolic alterations and 4) we have access to and expertise in the application of innovative, translational hyperpolarized 13C-MRS imaging methods to brain tumors. This research is significant because the metabolic biomarkers identified here will provide a non-invasive means of imaging TMMs, which are molecular features of brain tumors. This will enable clinicians to distinguish tumor from regions of normal brain, edema or necrosis and to monitor tumor recurrence and response to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Identification of imaging biomarkers tailored to TMM status will also allow detection of tumor response to novel TMM inhibitors and the development of resistance to TMM inhibitors. Importantly, since TMMs are a universal hallmark of cancer, our imaging biomarkers can potentially also be applied to tumor types other than gliomas. PROJECT NARRATIVE Telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs) are molecular hallmarks of cancer and are linked to significant metabolic reprogramming in brain tumors. Our goal is to leverage this link to identify novel, translational, metabolic imaging biomarkers that can non-invasively inform on TMM status and, thereby, provide a means of distinguishing tumor from normal brain, edema or necrosis, of monitoring tumor recurrence, of tracking response to therapy including novel TMM inhibitors and of monitoring the development of resistance to TMM inhibitors.

"Using Connectomics and Machine Learning to Predict Survival in Diffuse Glioma ABSTRACT Diffuse gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumors. Clinical outcomes, including overall survival, vary significantly across individual patients and are not adequately explained by known prognostic factors such as age, histologic and molecular pathology, and imparted treatments. A deeper understanding of prognostic influences in diffuse glioma can facilitate therapeutic decision making and patient counselling and lend further insight into the biologic underpinnings of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain are part of standard pre-operative evaluation in these patients. As brain structure and function are modulated by biologic and environment factors, MRI-derived metrics often provide sensitive prognostic biomarkers. We have preliminarily shown that connectomics, a method of measuring brain connectivity from MRI, can accurately predict survival in patients with diffuse glioma. We will retrospectively obtain at least 1,150 datasets and attempt to validate our preliminary models (Aim 1). We will also examine connectome phenotypes associated with tumor genotypes to help refine and improve our models (Aim 2). Accurate pre- operative prediction of outcome may ultimately allow for better tailored interventions for the individual patient and assist clinicians in optimizing both tumor control and neurologic function in treatment decision making. Narrative Accurate pre-operative prediction of outcome following diffuse glioma may ultimately allow for better tailored interventions for the individual patient. The proposed study aims to determine a model for predicting survival and neurocognitive functioning from simple brain scans that are routinely acquired as part of standard of care.

"Multiscale Resolution and Deep Network Approaches for Deconvolving Different Cell Types in Bulk Tumor using Single-cell Sequencing Data (scDEC) Abstract: Tumors are complex ecosystems composed of heterogeneous cell populations. Understanding the clonal cellular composition of the tumor and the non-malignant cells within the tumor ecosystem provides significant insights in the tumor recurrence, treatment, initiation, progression and metastasis. Previous studies estimated immune cell type content in bulk tumor expression data using immune cell signatures generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, with the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing methods, we can now also estimate the tumor associated non-malignant and malignant cell type contents.  In this proposal, we describe a novel deep net approach for deconvolving different cell types in bulk tumor using single-cell sequencing data (scDEC). We will also infer tumor associated copy number variation (CNV) clones and their signatures from single-cell RNA sequencing data using our novel multiscale resolution signal processing based algorithm. Our approach will estimate not only the content of different immune cell types and tumor associated non-malignant cell types but also the content of different CNV clone types in bulk tumor. Moreover, we will discover new associations between cell type content and sample phenotype such as disease survival, subtype and outcome. Our proposed project will lead to major improvements in clinical care to guide the treatment and prognosis of various types of cancer. Narrative Here we describe a novel multiscale resolution and deep net based approaches for deconvolving different cell types in bulk tumor using single cell RNA sequencing data (scDEC).

"Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides PROJECT SUMMARY: Tissue-based investigation remains a cornerstone of cancer research. With the advent of cost-effective digital scanners, large-scale quantitative investigations are now feasible using high throughput analysis of two- dimensional (2D) image datasets. However, 2D image analytics has its limitations, since pathologic diseases occur in three-dimensional (3D) space and 2D representations suffer from significant information loss. There are major gaps for 3D analytical digital pathology, including lack of image analysis tools to quantitatively process 3D data volumes and lack of an effective and scalable data management and analytical infrastructure to model, curate, query and mine large-scale spatial pathology features and biomarkers. We propose to fill these gaps with a new informatics solution directed at better understanding of 3D tumor micro-environments, with driving use cases on immunotherapy study for enhanced immune cell infiltration for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pathophysiological study of rapid tumor progression in brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). In line with Human Tumor Atlas program, we propose to create a novel and comprehensive 3D digital pathology analytics framework to quantitatively analyze spatial patterns of pathologic hallmarks and biomarkers related to disease progression in an authentic 3D tissue environment with quantitative digital pathology image volume processing, spatially integrative histology-molecular image analysis, large-scale spatial data analytics, and key cellular compartment tracking for clinical treatment response test and immunotherapy development. To enable a wide use of informatics tools for 3D digital pathology imaging data in cancer research, we will further upgrade a comprehensive, web-based system for multi-modality microscopy image management, dissemination, and visualization. We will leverage a large set of informatics tools and algorithms we have developed for microscopy image analysis, integrative translational cancer research, pathology spatial analytics, and high performance computing in the past 14 years. The developed tools will be tested and used by a suite of well-funded cancer research projects on pancreatic cancer, brain tumor, head and neck, liver, and lung cancers. The proposed informatics tools will enable precise and comprehensive characterizations of the histologic, molecular, cellular and tissue-level interactions at critical transition stages in cancer progression. They will also allow for a precise interrogation of physical and spatial signatures of immune cell infiltration into tumors, and the interactions between the host immune system and tumor cell metastasis within a complex tumor micro-environment architecture, essential for immunotherapy development. The completion of the proposed study will boost our informatics technology capabilities for large scale microscopy image analytics, help cancer researchers accurately understand cancer biology and progression mechanisms, and enable clinicians an easy access to clinically relevant information from large scale microscopy images for computer based diagnosis and therapeutic development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tissue based cancer research and therapy development are significantly challenged by strong tumor heterogeneity, biased information derived from two-dimensional tissue sections, spatially distorted genetic biomarker profiles in tissue space, and lack of dynamic Tumor Micro-Environment (TME) characterizations, presenting a serious barrier to enhance cancer research and treatment. Informatics tools for three- dimensional (3D) digital pathology imaging data capturing both histology hallmarks and molecular biomarkers from both static and dynamic environments are promising to create longitudinal human tumor atlas, necessary for in-depth TME and its progression study. We, therefore, propose to create a scalable and effective 3D digital pathology analytics framework for large-scale 3D pathology imaging data, providing novel and accessible methods on pathology image integration, analysis, visualization, and 3D spatial pathology/biomarker data query for efficient test and discovery of spatial interactions of 3D pathology and biomarker objects in cancer research and targeted therapy development.",Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides,10238813,U01CA242936,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head Cancer', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Online Systems', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Visualization', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'community engaged research', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational cancer research', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor initiation', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'web app']",NCI,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,308056
"Single-cell characterization of tumor and microenvironment co-evolution in Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas Project Summary Tumor and microenvironment constitute complex ecologies involving a multitude of stromal cells, immune cells, and in some cases coexisting microbes. A paradigmatic example of complex tumor-microenvironment interactions are peripheral T-cell lymphomas, aggressive and genetically complex tumors where tumor cells often constitute a minority cell population. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas are frequently associated with the presence of Epstein-Barr virus whose role in the disease remains largely uncharacterized. We have shown that the presence of specific macrophage populations and viral transcriptional programs are associated to survival. But, how do tumor and microenvironment coevolve and inform prognosis? Our project goal is to characterize the tumor- microenvironment interactions and coevolution in peripheral T-cell lymphomas using large collections of human transcriptomic data and longitudinal single-cell sequencing data from recently developed mouse models. We will develop an approach based on random matrix theory and topological data analysis for modelling the continuous aspect of tumor microenvironment evolution. We will further deploy our lab-developed methodology for in silico pathogen detection to study the interactions between the Epstein-Barr virus and peripheral T-cell lymphoma lymphomagenesis and progression. Successful completion of our goals will provide a general, experimentally validated strategy to uncover the dynamical nature of tumor-microenvironment interactions at the single-cell resolution in tumor types with complex stromal component. Additionally, our approach will help uncover new microenvironment driven targets supporting lymphoma cell growth, with potential therapeutic implications for the treatment of this deadly disease. Narrative Tumor and microenvironment coexist and coevolve determining clinical outcomes. We will provide an experimentally validated strategy to uncover the dynamical nature of tumor-microenvironment interactions at the single-cell resolution using peripheral T-cell lymphomas as a paradigmatic example.",Single-cell characterization of tumor and microenvironment co-evolution in Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas,10218124,U01CA243073,"['Address', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epstein Barr Virus associated tumor', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections', 'Epstein-Barr Virus latency', 'Evolution', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammatory', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Latent virus infection phase', 'Lymphoid', 'Lymphoid Cell', 'Lymphoma', 'Lymphoma cell', 'Lymphomagenesis', 'Lytic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Methodology', 'Microbe', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Proteomics', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinically relevant', 'computational pipelines', 'cytokine', 'denoising', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'macrophage', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'single cell sequencing', 'theories', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor initiation', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2021,607499
"Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Detection and Targeted Therapy Monitoring Platform for Ovarian Cancer Micrometastases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  A major challenge in the management of advanced ovarian cancer is the presence of disseminated microscopic tumor nodules within the intraperitoneal cavity. Despite surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, as many as 50% of patients can show occult disseminated disease, with only a 43% survival rate. Furthermore, systemic chemotherapy can have toxic side effects. Thus, recent efforts have aimed at improving detection and treatment of micromets. Chemophototherapy (CPT), the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy, is an emerging cancer treatment modality that can provide synergistic efficacy of both therapies. The overall goal is to implement a quantitative laparoscopic imaging and treatment approach for advanced detection of micromets and optimization of CPT for targeted destruction of ovarian micromets and reduced toxic side effects. Quantitative fluorescence laparoscopic imaging will provide high sensitivity and resolution for detecting micromets as well as image guided drug delivery. Folate receptor alpha (FA) will be used as a promising target because it is highly specific of epithelial ovarian cancer. The proposed targeted CPT compound has a ~6-fold tumor-specificity providing enhanced fluorescence contrast. These folate-targeted, porphyrin-phospholipid doped liposomes are triggered directly by near infrared (NIR) light. This activates the anti-cancer photosensitizer outer layer and releases the anti-cancer agent Doxorubicin (Dox). While this nanocarrier is expected to improve detection of micromets, tissue absorption and scattering in living tissue can confound fluorescence contrast. Quantitative imaging based on spatial frequency domain imaging can eliminate these confounding effects and provide quantitative contrasts to enable more sensitive detection compared to raw fluorescence or white light visualization. Furthermore, this quantitative capability can function in near-real-time to provide feedback on drug release, thus allowing image-guided optimization of treatment light to ensure full drug release within each tumor. In Aim 1, a wide-field dual-channel laparoscope, fast quantification algorithms and targeted liposomal nano-construct will be implemented and optimized. In Aim 2, the platform will be validated in vivo for improved detection of micromets vs. raw fluorescence and white light. In Aim 3, the platform’s efficacy will be validated in vivo for destroying micromets in targeted tumors while reducing toxicity to surrounding normal tissues. Successful completion of this approach is expected to result in improved detection and treatment of micromets with reduced side effects. This is ultimately expected to lead to reduced recurrence rates and overall improved survival. Although this imaging approach focuses on epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment, it can be applicable to a wide range of epithelial diseases, such as oral, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers. NARRATIVE A quantitative laparoscopic spatial frequency domain imaging platform is proposed to map intraperitoneal ovarian metastases as well as to treat them effectively via targeted chemo-photo therapy. Cancer-targeting drug and optimized light delivery will allow local release and preferential uptake of the drug into tumors versus normal tissue for optimal cancer cell destruction with minimal side effects to the surrounding normal tissue. This approach is relevant to public health as it is expected to significantly improve detection and destruction of micromets in ovarian cancer patients, and reduce side effects in normal tissue, thereby fulfilling the overarching goal of improving patients’ survival rates and quality of life.",Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Detection and Targeted Therapy Monitoring Platform for Ovarian Cancer Micrometastases,10219200,R01CA243164,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biodistribution', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial ovarian cancer', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'FOLR1 gene', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Folic Acid', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Laparoscopes', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lipids', 'Liposomal Doxorubicin', 'Liposomes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm to the Ovary', 'Micrometastasis', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nodule', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ovarian', 'Ovarian Carcinoma', 'PUVA Photochemotherapy', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phospholipids', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Phototherapy', 'Physiological', 'Platinum', 'Porphyrins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'anti-cancer', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'contrast enhanced', 'controlled release', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'fluorescence imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'image-guided drug delivery', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'intraperitoneal', 'liposome vector', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'nano', 'nanocarrier', 'nanomedicine', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'phantom model', 'quantitative imaging', 'side effect', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment optimization', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity', 'uptake']",NCI,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,336645
"Comprehensive characterization of the cancer microbiome and its immuno-oncology interface Project Summary/Abstract  Cancer has long been described as a disease of the human genome, and the past two decades of research have largely focused on characterizing the molecular mechanisms that contribute to its origin, progression, and treatment resistance.1,2,28–30 Over the past year, a series of seminal studies have identified significant non-human, microbial contributions in the development and advancement of solid tumors, hematologic malignancies, and germline cancer syndromes, as well as the variable efficacy of chemo- and immunotherapy, shedding light on what may be considered cancer’s ‘second’ genome (the metagenome).3–11,25 The extent of these microbial contributions across diverse cancer types in the human body and their implications on broader clinical management, however, remain largely unknown.12 Answering basic questions regarding the presence and specificity of such microbes in certain cancer types and cancer stages could guide the rational design of new, microbially-based diagnostics, prognostics, and therapies. Further, addressing more complex questions regarding the interactions of these microbes with cancer and host immune cells in the tumor microenvironment could provide critical insight into the design of personalized immunotherapy, cancer vaccines, and cancer risk profiles, hopefully leading to improved patient outcomes.  This proposal builds on a recent analysis of the cancer microbiome in 14,038 primary tumors, through which I have shown that virtually every major tumor type in the human body carries a unique, discriminative microbial signature. Inspired by recent evidence that highlights the role of pathogen-centric immunobiology in cancer development16,17 and the ability of microbes to powerfully modulate the systemic and local immune systems,5,6,8,18 I now hypothesize that the broad existence of these cancer microbes provides an evolutionary advantage for tumors to escape the host immune system’s recognition and response. I also hypothesize that the same immunological processes that are known to shape cancer’s mutational and phenotypic landscapes are concurrently shaping the tumor microbiota. Armed with patient germline HLA allele data and inferred immune cell abundances in the same primary tumors as those in our cancer microbiome study, I believe these hypotheses are finally testable. Aim 1 of this project seeks to investigate them alongside immunotherapy response data.21,22 Complementarily, Aim 2 seeks to define the intratumoral spatial distribution of the cancer microbiome and associated immune cells using a combination of computational and wet lab analyses. These results will contribute to our foundational knowledge on what is becoming the immuno-oncology-microbiome (IOM) axis.  The proposed interdisciplinary research will take place at UC San Diego in collaboration with microbiome, systems biology, tumor immunology, pathology, and oncology experts, who serve as mentors and advisors to me. Through their invaluable mentorship, hands-on learning, networking, and additional graduate coursework, I will grow into the translational and effective physician-scientist I so desire to be. Project Narrative The long-held view that cancer is a “sterile” entity is starting to change. New evidence suggests that intratumoral microbes can affect the development, progression, and treatment resistance of solid tumors. My preliminary findings suggest that unique microbial signatures exist for every major tumor type in the human body, and this proposal extends that work to characterize the interfaces between these cancer microbes, cancer cells, and the host immune system.",Comprehensive characterization of the cancer microbiome and its immuno-oncology interface,10112096,F30CA243480,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Alleles', 'Binding', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future Generations', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Oxygen', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Sterility', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer cell', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'design', 'digital', 'enteric infection', 'genome sequencing', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hands-on learning', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning network', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbial signature', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'pathogen', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'prognostic', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microbiota', 'tumor microenvironment', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2021,38109
"In vivo dual-axis confocal microscopy of 5-ALA-induced PpIX to guide low-grade glioma resections Summary Extent-of-resection is correlated with glioma patient outcomes such as progression-free survival. Image- guidance technologies, based on MRI and now fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS), have been developed to improve the surgeon’s ability to visualize gross tumor margins. However, there are fundamental limitations to wide-field imaging methods such as MRI and FGS, such as poor sensitivity to detect disseminated tumor cells at the infiltrative margins of diffuse gliomas, as well as the non-quantitative and subjective nature of image interpretation. With the emergence of FGS using 5-ALA, and its recent approval by the FDA in 2017, the gap between low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG) patients, in terms of extent of resection, will likely widen since LGGs rarely generate sufficient PpIX fluorescence to be detected via wide-field FGS. Consequently, there is a clear need for improved intraoperative techniques with the sensitivity to detect and quantify residual LGGs at the margins of the tumor cavity in order to improve the extent of resection and delay recurrence. We have shown that high-resolution confocal microscopy has the sensitivity to visualize the sparse sub-cellular expression of PpIX in LGG patients treated with 5-ALA, even beyond the radiographic margins. Therefore, we will optimize a handheld optical-sectioning microscope to image 5-ALA-induced PpIX at the final resection margins in LGG patients, together with real-time video mosaicking to facilitate the imaging of large tissue areas, which will minimize sampling bias when imaging heterogeneous brain tissues (Aim 1). In order to facilitate the clinical acceptance of these techniques, we will establish a relationship between the microscopic patterns of PpIX expression and well-established biological metrics such as tumor burden and proliferative index (Aim 2). Finally, we will explore the hypothesis that quantitative microscopic imaging of PpIX of the resection margins is predictive of extent of resection, as currently defined by post-operative MRI, which would suggest that it has value for optimizing resections to minimize and/or delay recurrence (Aim 3). Collectively, these results will pave the way for future randomized controlled clinical studies to optimize resection procedures and outcomes for LGG patients (adults and children), many of whom can have good survival outcomes and quality of life. Relevance to public health We are developing a set of technologies to enable real-time intraoperative microscopy of the final resection margins of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients who have been administered with 5-ALA prior to surgery (FDA approved in 2017). These quantitative and sensitive imaging techniques have the potential to improve the extent of resection for LGG patients, and therefore to improve patient outcomes such as overall survival and progression-free survival (time to recurrence).",In vivo dual-axis confocal microscopy of 5-ALA-induced PpIX to guide low-grade glioma resections,10146311,R01CA244170,"['Adult', 'Aminolevulinic Acid', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biophotonics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Glioma', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Institutes', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronavigation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proliferation Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sterility', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Burden', 'Validation', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'fluorescence-guided surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'lens', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'overexpression', 'prototype', 'survival outcome', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,579585
"Antigen-independent prediction and biomarker identification of cancer-specific T cells Project Summary/Abstract Cancer immunotherapy has achieved remarkable clinical success treating late-stage tumors, yet the response rates remain low and the side effects are often severe. Designing effective immunotherapies relies on accurate identification of tumor-reactive T cells. This is an extremely difficult task because 1) most of the cancer antigens are unknown; 2) the majority of the tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) does not recognize cancer cells; and 3) without known antigens, the only approach to acquire such T cells is to perform ex vivo expansion of TILs stimulated by autologous cancer cells, which generates non-specific T cells and is infeasible to many patients. Nonetheless, this strategy is widely adopted in current clinical trials for anti-cancer treatment, despite its reduced therapeutic efficacy and unpredictable side effects of autoimmunity. Therefore, unbiased, antigen- independent identification of tumor-reactive T cells, if possible, will be a major clinical priority as it will significantly increase the efficiency and safety of T cell based immunotherapies. Here we propose to achieve this goal through the development of novel machine learning methods. Such approach has not yet been explored because the fundamental difference between cancer and non-cancer T cells lies in their receptor sequences (TCR), and training data of cancer-specific TCRs is currently unavailable. To prepare for this task, we have developed the software TRUST, to extract the T cell antigen-binding CDR3 regions from bulk tumor RNA-seq data, and the software iSMART to group these CDR3s into antigen-specific clusters. These tools allowed us to develop a new rationale for producing large training sets of tumor-reactive TCRs, even without knowing cancer antigens. In our preliminary analysis, we observed that TCRs from the training data can be matched to tumor antigens that bind to HLA-A*02:01 and elicit immune response in vivo. The cancer-specific CDR3 amino acid sequences also show significantly different biochemical features from non-cancer ones, based on which we further developed software DeepCAT to demonstrate the feasibility of de novo prediction of cancer TCRs. These exciting results highlighted the importance to develop better computational method to track the tumor-reactive T cells for clinical applications. Accordingly, we propose the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will deliver a new machine learning method for accurate classification of tumor-reactive T cells using the CDR3 sequences. In Aim 2, we will derive a set of biomarkers for the cancer-specific T cells for fast and accurate flow sorting of these T cells from TILs. In Aim 3, we will perform single cell sequencing and functional validation of cancer-specific T cells using humanized animal model to validate the predicted genes, and to produce a prioritized list of promising targets for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy development. These Aims will be accomplished with the great support from the excellent collaborators specialized in cancer immunology at UTSW. Successful completion of this proposal will provide an exciting new paradigm to identify tumor-reactive T cells for precision cancer immunotherapies. Project Narrative Identification of tumor-specific T cells is critical to immunotherapy development, yet remains a challenging task. In this project we will develop a novel machine learning method to study: 1) which T cells in the tumor microenvironment are reactive to malignant cells; 2) what signature genes can be used to track the cancer- specific T cells.

"Predicting response to anti-PD-1 therapy in triple negative breast cancer by comprehensive profiling of the tumor microenvironment Abstract Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, and affects more than 37,000 women each year. Previous work has shown that the presence of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of TNBC influences overall survival. This has prompted clinical trials testing immunomodulatory drugs for the treatment of this disease. Although immunotherapy has demonstrated success across a range of tumor types, only a subset of patients experience significant benefit. Identifying biomarkers to predict which patients will respond to these drugs has been extremely challenging. Sequencing based approaches require the tissue to be dissociated prior to analysis, and hence do not capture the spatial relationships between different cell types. Imaging methods do capture these spatial relationships, but can only visualize a small number of proteins at a time. This results in an incomplete picture of the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, since not all cell types can be identified at once. Our group has recently developed Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging, which allows for a nearly 10-fold increase in the number of antibodies that can be visualized simultaneously. Our hypothesis is that by combining this novel imaging modality with DNA and RNA sequencing, we will be able to comprehensively profile the tumor microenvironment of TNBC patients, and thus significantly improve prediction of response. In Aim 1, I will improve the computational tools our lab uses to identify the boundaries between adjacent cells in tissue, in order to accurately assign imaging signal to the correct cell. In Aim 2, I will use our lab’s novel imaging platform to profile samples from patients enrolled in a clinical trial targeting PD-1, a key immune regulatory protein. I will then use this rich information to predict patient response to therapy. In Aim 3 I will integrate sequencing data from the same samples with the imaging data we generated to determine how genetic alterations influence the composition of immune cells present in the tumor microenvironment. This work will increase our understanding of the immune interactions in TNBC, and will generate significantly improved models to predict response to immunotherapy. Project Narrative This proposal has direct public health relevance due to the insights we will gain into the mechanisms of response and resistance to immunotherapy. The findings generated in this project will guide follow-up studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms of response to immunotherapy, as well as clinical trials testing the ability of the identified biomarkers to prospectively predict patient response.",Predicting response to anti-PD-1 therapy in triple negative breast cancer by comprehensive profiling of the tumor microenvironment,10169215,F31CA246880,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antibodies', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exclusion', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Isotopes', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear Envelope', 'Nuclear Lamin', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reading', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aggressive breast cancer', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-PD1 therapy', 'base', 'breast cancer genomics', 'cancer cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'experience', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mass spectrometer', 'multiplexed imaging', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients Project Summary  Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and aggressive form of brain cancer affecting up to 20,000 new patients in the US every year. Standard of care therapies include stereotactic surgical resection, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. After initial treatment, patient monitoring is guided by standard MR imaging performed at routine intervals. Despite these rigorous therapies, current median survival is only 15 months. Imaging is a central part of brain tumor management, but MRI findings in brain tumor patients can be challenging to interpret and is further confounded by interpretation variability. Accurate interpretation of imaging is particularly important during the post-treatment phase of patient care as it can help clinicians proactively manage disease through early, precise characterization of true tumor recurrence. Disease-specific structured reporting systems attempt to reduce variability in imaging results by implementing well-defined imaging criteria and standardized language. The Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS), developed at Emory University, is one such framework streamlined for clinical workflows and includes quantitative criteria for more objective evaluation of follow-up imaging. While BT-RADS has had success with clinical adoptability, it still faces hurdles reducing interobserver variability and improving objective classification of disease state.  This proposed study addresses an unmet need for unbiased, quantitative metrics for robust, objective interpretation of follow-up imaging for GBM patients. Where previous evaluative methods used two-dimensional, representative MRI slices for evaluating the extent of tumor, we propose to develop a deep learning segmentation tool, accurately calculating volumes of tumor after surgical resection, and trained from our expansive database of patient data with contours manually drawn by radiation oncologists. Further, we propose to develop computationally advanced software for predicting disease progression building upon the clinically developed BT- RADS criteria. Such tools would assist physicians in caring for brain tumor patients through post-treatment surveillance and guide future clinical decision making. In addition, we believe these quantitative metrics would have unbounded potential in clinical trial settings where it may be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutics for GBM. Therefore, these assistive tools will be tested on clinical trial data to determine if they are superior to conventional measurements alone.  A fundamental goal of this proposal is ensuring the quantitative tools we develop are applicable for clinicians in their daily lives. Therefore, an effort will be made to collaborate extensively with clinicians to house the algorithms in sleek, intuitive software for physicians to utilize. Through the multidisciplinary environment, high performance computing, and clinical resources we have available, we believe this proposal will be successful in developing clinically assistive tools for unbiased, objective monitoring of GBM patients in clinical settings and evaluation of novel therapies in research settings. Project Narrative  Follow-up imaging for glioblastoma patients is challenging to interpret due to subjectivity in evaluating disease state and overlap between treatment effects and tumor progression. More objective follow-up criteria are vital for sensitive and accurate monitoring of glioblastoma patients after initial treatment to ensure proactive management of disease and accurate characterization of tumor recurrence. This research proposal will develop user-friendly quantitative software for lesion segmentation and disease-state assessment, providing unbiased metrics for post-treatment patient monitoring and guidance of management decisions in clinical and research settings.",Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients,10071871,F31CA247564,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Information Systems', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'aggressive therapy', 'automated image analysis', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'efficacy evaluation', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'implementation framework', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'quantitative imaging', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records Summary Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and systems changes on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with –omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration to enhance the DeepPhe platform with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. A diverse set of oncology studies led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, Ovarian Cancer, Colorectal Cancer and Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma will demonstrate the utility of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for an extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature to advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research. Relevance We propose research to enhance the ability of researchers to utilize data from unstructured medical records in their translational cancer research programs.

"Quantitative CEST MRI for GBM Early Response Prediction and Biopsy Guidance ABSTRACT  Despite advances in therapy, the most aggressive form of brain tumor, glioblastoma, remains almost universally fatal. The first-line therapy for this devastating cancer is maximum feasible surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy (CRT). It is encouraging that there are multiple second-line therapies in clinical trials that could improve life quality or prolong survival, such as anti- angiogenic therapy (AAT). In this scenario, the accurate determination of whether a patient is a responder or a non-responder at an early stage following CRT has become a significant factor in clinical practice. However, the limitations in neuroimaging complicate the clinical management of patients and impede efficient testing of new therapeutics. Even with the improvements in advanced imaging modalities, distinguishing true progression vs. pseudoprogression (induced by CRT), or response vs. pseudoresponse (induced by AAT) remain two of the most formidable diagnostic dilemmas. Hence, the current gold standard for diagnosis and local therapy planning is still based on pathologic appraisal of tissue samples. However, even this yields variable results due to the intra-tumoral heterogeneity of treatment response. Therefore, reliable imaging tools, capable of early prediction of the tumor response to clinical therapies, are urgently needed. Amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) imaging is a chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)-based molecular MRI technique, which has been demonstrated to add important value to the clinical MRI assessment in neuro-oncology. However, most currently used imaging protocols are essentially semi-quantitative, and the images obtained are often called APTw images because of other contributions. Notably, it has been shown that quantitative CEST-MRI is able to achieve more pure and higher APT signals in patients with brain tumors. On the other hand, deep- learning is a state-of-the-art imaging analysis technique that provides exciting solutions with minimum human input. In particular, the saliency maps derived act as a localizer for class-discriminative regions, and may have great potential to guide biopsies and local treatment regimens. The goals of this proposal are to demonstrate the potential of quantitative CEST-MRI to resolve two formidable diagnostic dilemmas for GBM patients and to develop an automated deep-learning framework for post-treatment surveillance and biopsy guidance. This application has three specific aims: (1) Implement and optimize the quantitative CEST-MRI technique and quantify its accuracy in predicting early response to CRT and survival; (2) Determine the capability of quantitative CEST-MRI to assess the response to bevacizumab; and (3) Develop a deep-learning pipeline that includes structural and CEST images for responsiveness differentiation and stereotactic biopsy guidance. If successful, our results—and particularly the deep-learning platform established—will be readily available to accurately identify early response and guide stereotactic biopsy, thus changing the clinical pathway. Distinguishing recurrent tumor from treatment effect following therapy remains a major clinical challenge in neuro-oncology. We will assess the potential of quantitative CEST imaging methodologies and develop an automated, deep-learning framework for post-treatment surveillance and biopsy guidance. If successful, the implications for the clinical management of patients with brain tumors and for the robust evaluation of the efficacy of experimental therapeutics are enormous.",Quantitative CEST MRI for GBM Early Response Prediction and Biopsy Guidance,10118591,R37CA248077,"['Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Amides', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Local Therapy', 'Localized Malignant Neoplasm', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Glioma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment Protocols', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'diagnosis standard', 'efficacy evaluation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'neuro-oncology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'predicting response', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'response', 'temozolomide', 'treatment effect', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,382996
"Interdisciplinary Epidemiologic Consortium to Investigate T-cell Response in Colorectal Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The immune system has pivotal influence in the evolution and progression of many tumor types, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In particular, the presence of a strong T cell response in CRC, indicating activation of the adaptive immune system, has been associated with better patient outcomes. As such, recently developed immunotherapeutic approaches often attempt to harness the adaptive immune response. Immune cells are an integral component of the tumor microenvironment, and dynamically interact with neoplastic cells. However, our understanding as to the complexity of the T cell response and the factors that drive this response remains limited. The objective of this proposal is to identify genetic, lifestyle, and tumor factors associated with the T cell response in CRC, and to characterize the survival implications of that response. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will examine the relationship of personal characteristics with T cell response in CRC, including the role of (1a) germline genetic variation within human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes, and (1b) lifestyle factors (e.g., aspirin use, smoking, alcohol consumption). In Aim 2 we will focus on several colorectal tumor characteristics as they relate to T cell response, including (2a) the presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum and bacterial toxin genes in CRC, and (2b) somatic mutations in key signaling pathways (e.g., WNT signaling and RAS/RAF). In Aim 3, we will evaluate the associations of different aspects of T cell response with CRC survival, accounting for known prognostic factors and the relationships identified in Aims 1-2. To achieve these Aims, we propose to assess the density and spatial distribution of specific T cell subsets using multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) to quantify expression levels and co-expression patterns of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, and FOXP3 at the single cell level. This multiplexed assessment will allow us to examine the epidemiologic and prognostic relevance of numerous metrics of T cell response in CRC. This research will leverage the resources of the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR). GECCO-CCFR is a large collaborative effort between observational studies of CRC. We have completed genome-wide germline genotyping and have harmonized epidemiologic data regarding a variety of lifestyle factors and personal characteristics for all participating studies. We are conducting DNA sequencing with a panel of 205 human genes and a small number of bacterial genes in CRC tumor tissue. Prospective follow-up for survival is ongoing, and we have harmonized existing survival data. Through this project, we will add information on T cell response in CRC for >2,500 CRC cases to the GECCO-CCFR resource. This project provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the epidemiology of the T cell response in CRC and the relationship of that response with personal and tumor characteristics. Insights gained through this novel study could ultimately inform the development and targeted implementation of emerging immunotherapeutic and immunopreventative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE In this large, collaborative effort, we will examine how germline genetics, lifestyle factors, and tumor characteristics relate to the profile of T cells in colorectal cancers, and how those T cell profiles relate to cancer survival. The results of this work may ultimately inform strategies to harness the immune system for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.",Interdisciplinary Epidemiologic Consortium to Investigate T-cell Response in Colorectal Cancer,10134281,R01CA248857,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Immune System', 'Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Bacteroides fragilis toxin', 'CD3 Antigens', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Fusobacterium nucleatum', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Killer Cells', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mutate', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Proteins', 'Ras/Raf', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Smoking', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spatial Distribution', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'WNT Signaling Pathway', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer survival', 'cell mediated immune response', 'cell type', 'colon cancer family registry', 'colon cancer patients', 'colorectal cancer treatment', 'combinatorial', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'homeobox protein PITX1', 'immune function', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'macrophage', 'microbial', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'prognostic significance', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'survival outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,147364
"Fibroblast Heterogeneity in Pancreatic Cancer ABSTRACT Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is characterized by an extensive desmoplastic stroma that represents a major challenge for its effective treatment and improved survival of patients. We seek to define the composition and roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the most abundant cell population in the PDA stroma, as a potential avenue for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Although CAFs have been historically considered tumor-promoting components, their ablation in pre-clinical and clinical studies have led to mixed outcomes, indicating the poorly understood complexity of CAFs. To investigate CAF biology, we previously established a pancreatic tumor organoid/fibroblast co-culture model. In addition, we performed single cell RNA- sequencing (scRNA-seq) of murine and human PDA specimens to characterize CAF composition at single-cell resolution. These analyses have revealed that fibroblasts are heterogeneous and comprised of at least three distinct subtypes with unique transcriptional and functional features. More so, this heterogeneity emphasizes the need to design therapies that selectively target the tumor-promoting CAF populations. Although our work has started to reveal the complex heterogeneity of fibroblasts in primary or metastatic PDA tissues, iterative developments in scRNA-seq and analysis methods have revealed four additional CAF subtypes in primary and metastatic PDA. To comprehensively define the CAF repertoire in primary and metastatic PDA, we will systematically differentiate CAF subtypes and their regulatory elements using scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, machine-learning computational methods, and in situ tissue analytic methods that detect RNA and protein species, such as imaging mass cytometry (Aim 1). We hypothesize that a deeper understanding of the dynamic CAF states that occurs in primary and metastatic PDA will guide the selection of specific therapeutic regimens. To complement this analysis, we will identify new CAF subtypes and study their dynamics in a novel murine model with a reversible mutant Kras allele (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will study CAF-activating pathways by investigating several genes implicated in stromal activation that were revealed using our recently developed intraductal transplantation model of PDA (Aim 2). These new mediators appear to have roles in PDA progression, immunosuppression, and stromal activation, and may represent new PDA therapeutic targets. Finally, we have demonstrated different immunomodulatory functions of distinct CAF subtypes. We will test combinatorial strategies to target distinct CAF subtypes in the PDA microenvironment, and study the effect of these strategies on tumor progression in a murine PDA model (Aim 3). In addition, we will assess the role of macrophage-CAF crosstalk in promoting and maintaining CAF identify. Overall, this project will clarify the diversity of PDA CAFs and the role of cancer cells in regulating CAF subtypes. Our results will provide new avenues for CAF-targeting that we intend to translate towards improved therapies for patients afflicted by this lethal disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease, in part, because the cancer cells are able to recruit non-cancerous cells called “fibroblasts” that in turn can help the cancer cells grow and evade therapies. The purpose of this study is to better understand how these non-cancerous fibroblast cells change during the development of pancreatic cancer, how different types of noncancerous cells contribute to tumor growth, and how we can develop new drugs to prevent these cells from aiding the cancer cells. This work will identify new ways to block the cancer- promoting, fibroblast cells, which could lead to new treatments for patients affected by pancreatic cancer.",Fibroblast Heterogeneity in Pancreatic Cancer,10299050,R01CA249002,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Antigens', 'Biology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemoresistance', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytometry', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Desmoplastic', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Fibroblasts', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Situ', 'Inflammatory', 'KPC model', 'KRAS oncogenesis', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Mitogens', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prognosis', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Transposase', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'analytical method', 'cancer cell', 'combinatorial', 'curative treatments', 'effective therapy', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'macrophage', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pancreas development', 'pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'paracrine', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'progenitor', 'recruit', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'transplant model', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NCI,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2021,818876
"Integrative molecular dissection of acquired resistance to PD1/PD-L1 blockade in localized and metastatic urothelial carcinoma Project Summary/Abstract Metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) is generally incurable with modest survival benefit provided by first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy and post-platinum PD1/L1 inhibitor therapy. Optimal therapy for progressive mUC following PD1/L1 inhibitors is necessary with new agents for this setting (enfortumab vedotin, erdafitinib) providing modest incremental benefits coupled with toxicities. Limited data exist for analysis of tumor acquired after PD1/L1 inhibitor systemic therapy, which is necessary to determine causes of both response and resistance. Indeed, multiplatform analyses of post-PD1/L1 inhibitor UC tumor have not been reported. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that tumor, immune and stromal microenvironmental factors determine resistance to PD-1/L1 therapy mUC, and that integrated bulk and single cell molecular dissection of post-treatment tumors will reveal these features. We propose innovative and potentially transformative multiplatform longitudinally obtained bulk and/or single cell (sc) analysis of pre and post PD1/L1 inhibitor tumor tissue and plasma from muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and mUC to shed deep insights regarding tumor biology and resistance and information that can be used to develop new therapies. We will perform detailed multiplatform analyses on 2 separate cohorts totaling 170 patients: 1) tumor tissue obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor exposure or untreated controls (n=130) and 2) plasma cell-free (cf)-DNA obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor exposure or untreated controls (n=40). Whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA-Seq and orthogonal multiparametric IHC for immune markers is performed of baseline transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens and post-therapy tumors. Patients included are from trials that evaluated a PD1/L1 inhibitor (n=70) as neoadjuvant therapy preceding RC for MIBC, or who received a PD1/L1 inhibitor for mUC (n=50) and control untreated and temporally separated serial FFPE tumors without intervening therapy (n=10). scRNAseq is performed on a subset of post-PD1/L1 mUC tumors (n=20) to analyze tumor, stromal and immune cells. WES is performed for immunogenomic analyses using quality-controlled plasma cfDNA obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor therapy or control untreated patients (n=40). The functional relevance of specific genomic alterations and resultant predicted neoantigens is studied by examining functional immune and stromal readouts, which will shed insights regarding the immunogenicity of genomic alterations that can then provide the foundation for therapeutic advances. We will develop a novel integrated model using deep learning architecture to account for the stationary snapshot of the molecular tumor, stromal and immune profiles, and the time-based trajectory of clinical data to computationally aggregate heterogeneous data types. To summarize, this innovative study is expected to provide discoveries regarding determinants of UC progression following PD1/L1 inhibitors, an incurable disease setting with substantial unmet needs. Project Narrative Progressive metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) and muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with persistent disease at radical cystectomy (RC) following PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors has significant unmet needs. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that tumor, microenvironmental and immune cell genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic factors determine resistance to PD-1/L1 inhibitor therapy and metastasis in MIBC and mUC, and that integrated bulk and single cell molecular dissection of pre-treatment and post- treatment resistant tumors will reveal these features. This innovative study uses deep learning computational techniques to probe tumor biology of 170 patients to dissect the evolution of urothelial carcinoma resistance to PD1/L1 inhibitors and reveal potentially actionable therapeutic targets.",Integrative molecular dissection of acquired resistance to PD1/PD-L1 blockade in localized and metastatic urothelial carcinoma,10218294,R21CA249875,"['Aftercare', 'Architecture', 'Biopsy', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Blood', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Evolution', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Genomics', 'Harvest', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mononuclear', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Myomatous neoplasm', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'New Agents', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'PD-L1 blockade', 'PDL1 inhibitors', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'Platinum', 'Ploidies', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stromal Cells', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Harvesting', 'Toxic effect', 'Transitional Cell Carcinoma', 'Transurethral Resection', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell free DNA', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'exome sequencing', 'heterogenous data', 'immunogenicity', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'macrophage', 'muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'neoantigens', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optimal treatments', 'pembrolizumab', 'peripheral blood', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2021,476334
"Network mechanisms and bioengineering of precision immunotherapies for glioblastomas Project Summary/Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal malignancy of the human central nervous system (CNS). This devastating disease has a median overall survival of 3 months from time of diagnosis in untreated patients. Despite the significant cost and morbidity with standard of care surgical resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, life expectancy is only extended by a few months. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are a class of immunotherapies with an FDA-approved treatment for solid tumors. These work by directly lysing tumor cells, which then release tumor antigens with danger signals that elicit antitumor immunity. Adenovirus is a strong candidate OV immunotherapy for GBM because of its low neurotoxicity when delivered by intratumoral injection and its amenability to bioengineering. Ad5-Δ24, an adenovirus modified to replicate in GBM but not in other CNS cells, is perhaps the most promising OV in clinical trials. Major hurdles remain, however, including innate immunoresistance. This study will overcome these by elucidating complex tumor-OV interaction mechanisms at the systems level, designing and constructing improved OV candidates that exploit these mechanisms, and then validating the mechanisms by experimentally testing the OVs. Preliminary studies for this proposal demonstrate that GBM patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have distinct transcriptomes in vivo and can be cultured as neurospheres (Sp-GBMs) under serum-free conditions ex vivo. Ad5-Δ24 OV can lyse several different Sp-GBMs ex vivo and the level of this oncolytic activity is PDX specific. Additionally, preliminary in silico models suggest that such OV activity levels are contextually dependent on protein-protein interaction networks in the target GBM cells. This project will test the central hypothesis that dynamic transcriptional states of human GBM play key mechanistic roles in Ad5-Δ24 oncolytic efficacy; therefore, modeling the emergent system behaviors will guide the engineering of precision OV immunotherapies. The first aim will classify human GBM PDXs using transcriptomes to predict Ad5-Δ24 OV responses and identify context-specific network features. The resulting classifier and network models will be validated by assessing their ability to predict the response of Sp-GBM to Ad5-Δ24 OV treatment. The second aim will elucidate Ad5- Δ24 OV gene dependencies and resistance mechanisms in human GBM PDXs. Predictions from both aims will both experimentally and computationally validated. Synthetic Ad5-Δ24 OVs with shRNAs that perturb these gene dependencies and resistance mechanisms will be constructed and tested for efficacy. These precisely targeted alterations result in the quantifiable, predictable phenotypic effects of modulating human GBM gene expression and oncolysis ex vivo and in vivo. Such synthetic OVs will be useful as GBM research tools. As a future direction, the big data generated will be a valuable public resource to further interrogate antitumor immunity and inflammation states. Successful completion of these aims will yield novel GBM diagnostic subtypes with paired engineered OVs ready for preclinical development as precision immunotherapies.

"T cell mechanisms of immunotherapy response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Project Summary Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) provide durable clinical responses in about 20% of cancer patients, but have been largely ineffective for non-immunogenic cancers that lack intratumoral T cells. Most tumors have somatic mu- tations that encode for mutant proteins that are tumor-speciﬁc and not expressed on normal cells (termed neoanti- gens). Cancers, such as melanoma, with the highest mutational burdens are more likely to respond to single agent ICIs. However, most cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), have lower mutational loads, resulting in fewer T cells inﬁltrating the tumor. Studies have previously demonstrated that an allogeneic GM-CSF- based vaccine enhances T cell inﬁltration into human pancreatic cancer. Recent work with Panc02 cells, which express around 60 neoantigens similar to human PDAC, showed that PancVAX, a neoantigen-targeted vaccine, when paired with immune modulators cleared tumors in Panc02-bearing mice. This data suggests that cancer vaccines targeting tumor neoantigens induce neoepitope-speciﬁc T cells, which can be further activated by ICIs, leading to tumor rejection. Currently the impact of such treatment on T cell expression states and the underly- ing mechanism of therapeutic response remains poorly deﬁned. Comprehensive characterization of responding T cells will be critical in understanding mechanisms of response and providing rationale for combinatorial therapy. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that when used alongside neoantigen-targeted vaccines, individual ICIs have distinct as well as synergistic modes of action and that different treatment combinations result in distinct changes in the T cell repertoire related to immunotherapy response. To address this hypothesis, I propose two speciﬁc aims. Aim 1: To characterize the transcriptional changes in T cells during immunotherapy treatment. I will ﬁrst investigate the effect of PancVAX, with and without addition of ICIs, on gene expression at a single-cell level in the Panc02 mouse model. Then I will determine biological processes driving differences in anti-tumor response between treatment arms. I will experimenally validate these differences using ﬂow cytometry. Aim 2: To develop trajectory building methods depicting the clonal evolution of T cells. We will apply this method to T cell receptor sequencing data from human clinical trials of PDAC treated with vaccine and ICI to identify key changes within the T cell repertoire associated with tumor regression or resistance. Successful completion of these aims will inform future combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC patients and provide new open-source computational software to characterize T cell populations that can be applied to diverse cancer types. The skills I will acquire as I complete this research will prepare me for a career as an interdisciplinary scientist, characterizing the tumor immune landscape to inform precision immunotherapy. Project Narrative Immunotherapy has been largely unsuccessful in pancreatic cancer. However, vaccines can convert these oth- erwise immunologically insensitive tumors into those that respond to agents called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This project aims to better understand the mechanism of response when vaccines against tumor-speciﬁc antigens are combined with ICIs.",T cell mechanisms of immunotherapy response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,10139211,F31CA250135,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Allogenic', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Combination immunotherapy', 'Combined Vaccines', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease regression', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Grant', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'T cell clonality', 'T cell receptor repertoire sequencing', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trees', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'anti-tumor immune response', 'base', 'cancer type', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'effector T cell', 'exhaustion', 'human data', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'open source', 'pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'prevent', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'success', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Image-based models of tumor-immune dynamics in glioblastoma ABSTRACT The use of immunotherapy to treat cancer continues to generate hope and excitement among those involved in cancer care and research. However, our inability to explain why some patients do not respond to immunotherapy, combined with our inability to identify early response or predict the responders, poses serious challenges in this field. Currently, biopsies serve as the most informative way to assess the immunological activity within a cancerous area, but we are spatially and temporally limited in the number of biopsies we can obtain from patients, especially in cases of brain cancer. Clear evidence of tumor-immune environment heterogeneity across patients suggests that we will have to use an individualized approach in order to accurately assess patient tumor’s specific immune environment and the evolution of these complex systems. We propose to use computational modeling and artificial intelligence to bridge the spatial scales of the cellular content comprising each MRI at the voxel level, but also to bridge the temporal scales. We will focus on the most cellular immune population in glioblastoma, microglia/macrophages, that constitute as much as 50% of the cellular content of tumor specimens. By fusing MRI with the biological heterogeneity found in image- localized biopsies through such radiomics approaches provides an opportunity to individualize our understanding of the the tumor-immune environment, broadly benefiting scientists across the fields of oncology and immunology. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of the tumor at every imaging time point, the radiomics maps can also be used to parameterize dynamic mechanistic models of tumor growth to allow for prediction of future dynamics. These spatio-temporal models allow us to test hypotheses about causal relationships between different cell types and microenvironmental factors, as well as to verify whether the radiomics maps provide early dynamic insights into tumor response that can impact clinical decision making.

"Langworthy Diversity Supplement: Image-based models of tumor-immune dynamics in glioblastoma ABSTRACT Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most common of all gliomas with a median survival 14-18 months, despite aggressive treatment regimens. Immunotherapy is emerging as a promising method to treat cancer; however, we are not able to identify early response or predict who will respond. These uncertainties pose serious challenges to being able to effectively apply immunotherapeutic approaches. While biopsies are the most reliable way to assess the immunological landscape within the tumor, we are limited both spatially and temporally in the number of biopsies we can obtain, particularly for brain tumor patients. The heterogeneity of the tumor-immune landscape across patients suggests that a patient-specific approach will be required to accurately assess each patient’s individual tumor-immune environment and the evolution thereof. As part of the Parent Grant, we will use non-invasive imaging, image-guided biopsies, computational modeling, and artificial intelligence to bridge spatial and temporal scales and predict the abundance of glioma associated microglia/macrophages (GAMMs) comprising each magnetic resonance image (MRI) at the voxel level. Linking the MRI to the biological heterogeneity using radiomics approaches provides an opportunity to individualize our understanding of the tumor-immune environment. Specifically, for this supplement, we will use the predictive tumor-immune maps to develop an immunotherapy response metric termed GAMMs Days Gained (GDG), which is based on the existing Days Gained metric. GDG will be used to evaluate the GAMM population changes with therapy as depicted by the predictive map. We expect that the GDG will aid in understanding who will respond based on early predictive map changes. Additionally, the GDG metric will be compared to results from other immunotherapy response metrics, including the standard immunotherapy response assessment in neuro-oncology (iRANO) criteria. NARRATIVE While our inability to identify early response to immunotherapy in brain tumor patients poses a serious challenge to advancing cancer care and research, genomic information from image-guided biopsies, linked to non-invasive imaging through artificial intelligence and mechanistic modeling, is a useful way to assess tumor-associated immunological activity. Current methods to assess response to immunotherapy could benefit from this image- based predictive understanding of the tumor-immune landscape.

"Developing high-throughput genetic perturbation strategies for single cells in cancer organoids PROJECT SUMMARY  To address the complexity of heterogeneous cancers that are resistant to chemotherapy and frequently recur or metastasize, we propose to develop a set of tools based on multidisciplinary innovations combining Synthetic Biology, Cancer Organoid Technology, and Bioinformatics. These Synthetic Tools to Annotate Reporter Organoids for Cancer Heterogeneity and Recurrence Development (StarOrchard) include: Synthetic Promoter Activated Recombination of Kaleidoscopic Organoids (SPARKO), Combinatorial Genetics En Masse (CombiGEM), and single-cell RNA sequencing panorama (Scanorama). SPARKO can annotate heterogeneous cancer populations in living cells via fluorescent protein expression libraries to make multi- colored tumor organoids. CombiGEM can rapidly identify potential therapeutic targets via large-scale, massively parallel, and unbiased combinatorial genetic screens. Scanorama can integrate the analysis of large datasets of single-cell transcriptomics via sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms. These tools focus on barcoding strategies to enable accurate tracking and analysis of individual tumor cells that harbor distinct genetic aberrations, and substantially expand the utility of the Next Generation Cancer Models (NGCMs) for cancer mechanistic investigations or therapeutic discovery. The StarOrchard tools enable targeted genetic perturbations in annotated heterogeneous tumor phenotypes without destroying cells for sequencing. These tools will be applied to a large number and variety of NGCMs to optimize experimental protocol. To ensure success, we have convened an outstanding team: PI Timothy K. Lu, MD, PhD, has made strikingly original contributions to Synthetic Biology tools that enable high-throughput genetic interrogation of cancer cell drug dependency; PI Ömer Yilmaz, MD, PhD, has extensive expertise in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and has developed novel technologies to maintain patient-derived colon cancer organoids for in vivo modeling; and PI Bonnie Berger, PhD, will use her expertise in bioinformatics and her Scanorama algorithm to integrate data across all tumor types based on dynamic single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We are also supported by leading experts in cancer biology and various cancer types at both the basic science and clinical oncology frontiers of cancer research.

"Integrative Functional Profiling of Tumor-Derived Extracellular Vesicles PROJECT SUMMARY Clinical implementation of Precision Medicine faces major challenges in precision disease stratification and staging, determining optimal treatment, monitoring therapy response, and overcoming drug resistance and relapse. To address these challenges, there is a critical unmet need for better biomarkers and tests that complement current methods for accurate diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of response to treatments. Liquid biopsy presents an innovative non-invasive modality for precision oncology as it promises to provide a global view of tumor dynamics. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, are emerging as a new paradigm of liquid biopsy for non-invasive cancer diagnosis and monitoring. Exosomes are 40-150 nm membrane vesicles secreted by most cells and have been identified as essential mediators of cell interactions and signaling that promote tumor metastasis, drug resistance, and relapse. Despite the potential clinical impact of these findings, precise biological functions of exosomes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-mediated modulation of tumor microenvironments, and their potential clinical value remain yet to be determined. This is due in part to the daunting challenges in isolation and analysis of these nanovesicles with diverse molecular and functional properties. Here we hypothesize that functional phenotypes of circulating exosomes can provide potent biomarkers for detecting early malignancy, monitoring tumor progression and metastasis, and assessing therapy response in breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, we propose the advanced development and validation of a nano-engineered microfluidic biosensing system capable of integrative analysis of both molecular and functional phenotypes of exosomes in one streamlined workflow. The research will be performed by three specific aims: 1) Expand the MINDS strategy to develop an optimal 3D nano-engineered integrative EV molecular and activity profiling (EV-MAP) nanochip platform; 2) Adapt and optimize the EV-MAP technology for monitoring tumor burden and therapy response using mouse models; and 3) Evaluate and validate the EV-MAP technology for potential applications to clinical diagnosis and classification of breast cancer patients. The new technology will confer superior analytical capabilities to substantially accelerate the functional studies of circulating exosomes. Harnessing exosome activities for diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic benefit presents a paradigm-shifting mechanism for precision medicine. While focused on breast cancer in this project, our research will ultimately create a transformative tool for studies of a wide range of bioactive exosomes in various malignancies to develop reliable non-invasive liquid biopsy of cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE The lack of reliable non-invasive blood biomarkers presents a serious obstacle to the personalized management and treatment of cancer, more importantly, metastatic and recurrent disease. Our proposal aims to develop new tools to investigate circulating exosomes as a new paradigm of liquid biopsy in solid tumors. New non-invasive exosomal biomarkers and tests could profoundly impact the clinical strategies to monitor disease status and treatment and in post-therapy follow-up, to detect early disease recurrence.",Integrative Functional Profiling of Tumor-Derived Extracellular Vesicles,10190320,R33CA252158,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease stratification', 'Drug resistance', 'Engineering', 'Epithelial', 'Evolution', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Face', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'MMP14 gene', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Mesenchymal', 'Metastatic/Recurrent', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nanochip Analytical Device', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer diagnosis', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug relapse', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'liquid biopsy', 'lithography', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'microfluidic technology', 'mouse model', 'nanoengineering', 'nanopattern', 'nanovesicle', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'patient stratification', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized management', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'prototype', 'response', 'self assembly', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R33,2021,354506
"Integrative single cell analyses of inflammation-derived circulating hybrid cells to identify aggressive disease PROJECT SUMMARY The lifetime risk for acquiring colorectal cancer (CRC) is 7%, with an astounding rate of disease recurrence in 32% of newly diagnosed patients after their “successful” treatment. Patient with recurrent disease have a dismal 14.3% five-year survival. Lack of effective biomarkers hampers early detection of pre-metastatic disease, impacting overall survival from CRC. We identified a promising disseminated tumor cell—a product of macrophage (MФ) and cancer cell fusion—that harbors genotypic and phenotypic features of both cells of origin. Detectable along the metastatic cascade, hybrid cells can initiate tumor growth, migrate in response to MФ receptor-ligand chemotaxis, and seed metastatic sites. In peripheral blood, hybrids, named circulating hybrid cells (CHCs) outnumber conventionally defined circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in CRC patients, overcoming the sensitivity of CTC—a primary barrier—to usage as a biomarker for disease. CHCs are phenotypically diverse and reflect protein expression of the primary tumor. Based on these exciting findings, we propose that hybrid cells subpopulations harbor discrete phenotypes of pre-metastatic cells that can be identified and defined using single cell image-based phenotyping through multiplexed imaging and multimodal integration with –omics. To this end, we will analyze CHCs derived from early stage and metastatic tumors for image-based phenotyping with single cell gene expression. Utilizing quantitative and advanced image analytics including deep learning approach for image-based cell profiling, we will define inter/subcellular spatial features in single cells to identify new subpopulations and differentiate discrete phenotypic populations associated with metastatic signatures. In addition, the application of both imaging and genomic technologies to the same specimen independently measures highly dimensional, yet non-orthogonal, sets of cellular features. Multimodal integration of imaging and single cell data will quantify systems-level biological functions of cellular subpopulation and enhance imaging biomarker panel to gain biomarker specificity and sensitivity for validation in a discrete CRC patient cohort. Our overall goal is to develop a novel tumor biomarker, based upon CHC phenotyping and –omics analyses that can be used to provide new quantitative insights and develop machine-driven prediction with superior accuracy for identifying risk of metastases in CRC patients to ultimately impact survival. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite advances in screening, colorectal cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related death due to a high recurrence rate after initial treatment and a dismal 14.3% survival rate of patients with recurrent disease. Improving survival from colorectal cancer requires the ability to develop effective biomarkers for early detection of recurrent/pre-metastatic disease.

"Correcting [18]F-Misonidazole PET with MRI and EPR to improve hypoxia-guided radiation therapy Project Summary  In this project, we propose to correct [18]F-Misonidazole (FMISO) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images to make PET be more accurate in measuring hypoxia. Hypoxia - a deficiency in oxygen - is a strong promotor of tumor radioresistance, yet there are no established clinical methods to accurately image oxygenation in vivo to improve treatment. Preclinical studies that acquired pO2 measurements using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging have shown that targeting hypoxic tumor sub-regions with a boost of TCD95 after irradiating the whole tumor with TCD15, significantly increased tumor control when compared to the boosting normoxic tumor sub-regions with TCD95. So far this has been demonstrated in fibrosarcoma (p = 0.04) and mammary carcinoma (p = 0.013) tumor types. This shows that if hypoxic tumor sub-regions can be accurately imaged and targeted with a boosted dose – better known as dose painting – the overall dose deposition to surrounding healthy tissues can be decreased while improving tumor control.  In recent years, clinical trials have used FMISO PET for radiation therapy dose plans with the hypothesis that targeting hypoxic tumor regions with a boost of radiation, as defined by FMISO uptake, would increase survival. These trials did not, however, show improvement when compared to treatment plans with and without a boost of radiation. These outcomes are in direct contrast to the EPR hypoxia studies previously mentioned. We hypothesize this is due to the imperfect binding mechanisms of FMISO to hypoxic cells, as well as general limitations of PET tracers being unable to reach hypoxic tumor regions due to their chaotic vasculature or acidosis. In response to the failure of using only FMISO PET to target hypoxia, we propose to include anatomical and physiological information of tumor vasculature and pH imaged with Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, respectively. DCE-MRI and CEST-MRI will be used to correct the PET image to show hypoxic tumor regions, using EPR as the ground truth of hypoxia.  The specific aims of the proposal are to develop and execute a study design to (1) evaluate discrepancies between tumor hypoxia regions as defined by FMISO PET and EPR, (2) identify tumor features in DCE-MRI and CEST-MRI that result in poor overlap between hypoxia as defined by PET and EPR, and (3) develop a correction PET/MRI algorithm to improve PET measurement of hypoxia, using EPR hypoxia measurements as the gold standard. Upon completion, aim 1 will demonstrate the need for correcting FMISO PET images. Aim 2 will identify correlations between vascular permeability and pH features and low or high PET uptake, where it might not match with hypoxia as defined by EPR. The third aim will take those features to create a decision tree algorithm to correct FMISO PET definition of hypoxia. We intend for this PET/MRI correction algorithm to eventually be implemented in clinical trials to improve radiation therapy to hypoxic tumors. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to make FMISO PET more accurate in its measurement of tumor hypoxia. We aim to correct PET data with a combination of MRI images that map physiological properties of the tumor, such as vasculature and pH measurements, while using oxygen measurements from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging as the ground truth.

"New treatment monitoring biomarkers for brain tumors using multiparametric MRI with machine learning Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate novel imaging biomarker(s) that use multiparameter MRI methods to identify the true spatial extent of glial brain tumors. The standard RANO (response assessment in neuro-oncology) criteria define tumor extent as the region of bright signal on post-contrast agent T1w (T1+C) images, termed the contrast enhancing lesion (CEL), along with the peritumoral bright signal on T2w FLAIR images, referred to as non-enhancing lesion (NEL). Yet, the CEL reflects the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to contrast agent and can appear the same for both tumor and treatment effect. Likewise, though NEL likely contains tumor, current imaging cannot distinguish tumor from edema. These difficulties result in the inability of current anatomical MRI methods to determine the true spatial extent of glial tumors, a serious limitation for treatment management of brain tumor patients. We and others have shown that advanced MRI methods, including perfusion and diffusion MRI, are useful for assessing tumor grade, predicting outcomes, or distinguishing tumor from treatment effect. Yet, almost exclusively, the approach has been to extract mean values of a single physiological parameter from predetermined tumor regions of interest and then measure their correlation with the desired clinical index. Although this approach has been useful for initial biomarker development, it underutilizes the rich multiparameter and spatial information available, thus motivating the current study. First, two multiparameter MRI biomarkers will be developed to identify enhancing and infiltrating tumor burden. Then, they will be evaluated individually and in combination to assess the total tumor burden in comparison with the standard volumetric metrics in current use. The development and testing of these biomarkers will be accomplished in several independent steps outlined by the proposed aims. First (Aim 1), we propose to develop an MRI biomarker that gives the voxelwise probability of enhancing tumor burden within CEL, with early results showing the ability to distinguish tumor from treatment effect. Next, we will develop a multiparameter biomarker capable of identifying infiltrating tumor within NEL (Aim 2). These efforts leverage our previous results using artificial intelligence, recent advances in machine learning, and our unique brain tumor tissue bank with hundreds of biopsy samples spatially matched to imaging. Finally (Aim 3), the spatial extent of tumor burden within CEL and NEL will be tested in their ability to distinguish pseudo-progression/response from true progression/response, which is a primary question that confounds treatment management today. In summary, multiparameter advanced MRI biomarkers of enhancing and infiltrative brain tumor have the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how treatment is managed, ultimately resulting in improved outcomes. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel multiparametric MRI biomarkers that precisely identify regions of brain tumor within areas of contrast-enhancement and peritumoral edema, which cannot be identified using standard MRI. Powered by recent advances in machine learning, our approach has the potential to cause a fundamental shift in the treatment management of patients with brain tumors.",New treatment monitoring biomarkers for brain tumors using multiparametric MRI with machine learning,10220248,R01CA255123,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Edema', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Excision', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Lesion', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Markers', 'Work', 'bevacizumab', 'biomarker development', 'blood-brain barrier permeabilization', 'chemoradiation', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'molecular marker', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'tumor']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R01,2021,547655
"Integrative Prediction of Therapeutic Response in T-cell Lymphoma by Omic and Spatial Modeling ABSTRACT The tumor ecosystem plays a critical role in tumor development, progression and therapeutic response. Previous studies have utilized dissociative and single-cell omics technologies to profile the tumor ecosystem, specifically to understand therapeutic resistance and identify predictive biomarkers for precision cancer medicine. Yet, very few of these biomarkers have adequate performance characteristics for adoption in clinical practice. We hypothesize that a fundamental facet of the tumor ecosystem, i.e., the spatial organization of cells, which encodes key information involving paracrine and juxtracrine interactions that drive “neighborhood- level” biology, can further inform predictive models. Recent technological breakthroughs in highly multiplexed imaging and spatial transcriptomics offer an unprecedented opportunity to delineate the therapeutic consequences of spatial relationships within clinical tumor samples. Quantitative spatial features can provide independent valuable information, which is unlikely to be captured by clinical, genetic and bulk-transcriptional predictors. Hence, we propose to integrate highly multiplexed imaging data with omic approaches to delineate mechanisms of resistance and build predictive models of response for patients with T-cell lymphoma, who have a desperate unmet clinical need. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will build automated computational tools to robustly quantify spatial features from highly multiplexed imaging data and integrate it with exome and RNA- Seq. I will utilize >100 primary specimens collected pre-, on- and after-treatment with the PI3K-δγ inhibitor duvelisib to nominate mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance. In Aim 2 (K99 phase), I will build an integrated machine-learning model to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from duvelisib and evaluate the impact of spatial features towards model performance. In Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will validate the model in an independent cohort and extend to samples from patients treated with additional agents, to identify consistent and parsimonious signatures of spatial features that could be developed for broader use. My extensive background in computational biology and experimental biology puts me in a unique position to accomplish this proposal. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators (Drs. David Weinstock, Peter Sorger, Jon Aster, Allon Klein, Peter Park, and Steven Horwitz) with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. I will acquire new skills in (1) computational analysis of highly multiplexed imaging to model molecular and spatial information, (2) data integration methods to delineate regulatory programs for designing effective drug combinations and (3) analysis of predictive biomarkers in clinical trial samples from clinical trials. Together with institutional support from Dana Farber Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital to transition into an independent position and establish an independent, data science-driven, translational research program. PROJECT NARRATIVE T-cell lymphomas (TCLs) are highly diverse and patients with relapsed disease have a dismal prognosis. The PI3K-δγ inhibitor duvelisib induces response in 60% of patients with TCL through tumor cell-intrinsic and immunomodulatory mechanisms, but nearly all responders ultimately develop resistance. We hypothesize that the integration of spatial data, including neighborhood analyses to identify para- and juxtacrine interactions, with genetic and transcriptional alterations will inform predictive models for duvelisib response and nominate mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance that can aid therapeutic selection and broadly applied across tumor types.",Integrative Prediction of Therapeutic Response in T-cell Lymphoma by Omic and Spatial Modeling,10115190,K99CA256497,"['1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase', 'Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Immune', 'JAK1 gene', 'JAK2 gene', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Non-Malignant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcription Alteration', 'Validation', 'Voting', 'base', 'cancer type', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'liquid crystal polymer', 'mRNA Expression', 'molecular modeling', 'multiplexed imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neural network', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'paracrine', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'random forest', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'single cell technology', 'skills', 'spatial integration', 'spatial relationship', 'spectrograph', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support vector machine', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational research program', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K99,2021,136080
"Characterization of extrachromosomal DNAs in tumors through computational analysis of single-cell and bulk sequencing data PROJECT SUMMARY Extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) are found in 40% of tumors but rarely found in normal cells. Importantly, they contain and express amplified oncogenes derived from chromosomal sequences. In contrast to the chromosomes, ecDNAs segregate unequally to daughter cells during cell division and thus can accumulate at high copy numbers in individual cells within a tumor. This contributes to intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), which can give subsets of tumor cells a selective growth advantage and enable resistance to cancer treatment. While previous studies have focused on how ITH of chromosomal mutations contributes to tumor evolution, little is known about how ecDNAs might impact tumor evolution and patient outcomes. To address how ecDNAs contribute to ITH and tumor evolution, Aim 1 will determine the ITH of ecDNAs for cell lines derived from patient-matched primary and recurrent glioblastoma tumors for which single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) and standard bulk short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data have been previously generated. To overcome the technical challenge of detecting individual ecDNAs in scDNA-seq data, we will employ an alternative supervised approach of using `breakpoints' between high-copy number segments in the scDNA-seq data as surrogates for the ecDNA breakpoints and intersect these with the identified ecDNA breakpoint sequences in the reference sets. This approach will enable us to study ecDNA-driven ITH and evolution in single cells between the cell lines derived from the longitudinal glioblastoma tumors. We will also apply this approach to existing scDNA-seq datasets to assess the presence of ecDNAs. Current computational tools used to predict ecDNAs in standard bulk short-read WGS data have limited ability to determine the ecDNA breakpoints in single cells; thus, we anticipate that our proposed approach, while conceptually simple, will have a major impact on improving our understanding of how ecDNAs evolve within the cells of a tumor. In Aim 2, a large cohort of publicly available tumor bulk WGS datasets representing multiple cancer types will be leveraged to more broadly characterize ecDNAs and their effects on tumor evolution. We will perform integrative analysis of ecDNAs and other genomic features using a large number of tumors to characterize ecDNAs and to infer the potential molecular mechanisms underlying their formation. We will build a machine learning classifier that can predict the presence of ecDNAs using non-WGS data (i.e. whole-exome and RNA sequencing) that have been a primary strategy for sequencing patient tumors, and therefore, are more widely available than WGS. We will also systematically analyze a large number of single-time point and longitudinal tumor samples to characterize the effects of ecDNAs on evolutionary selection pressures in tumors. Overall, completion of these Aims will greatly advance our understanding of ecDNAs in tumor evolution, thereby shedding light on how ecDNAs impact patient outcomes and ultimately establishing a basis for novel cancer therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE A major cause of cancer treatment failure is the development of therapy resistance in tumors, which evolve by accumulating tumor-promoting mutations and modified chromosome structures in a subset of their cells. Recent studies have found that the effect of tumor-promoting mutations can be amplified when they are incorporated into extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), a poorly understood form of DNA that is distinct from the chromosomes and is commonly found in tumor cells. To better understand how ecDNA promotes tumor growth, impacts cancer patient outcomes, and could be exploited as a novel target for cancer therapy, we propose to computationally analyze the DNA sequences of tumor cells from multiple cancer types in order to assess the presence and number of ecDNAs, characterize the tumor-promoting mutations they carry, and determine how they influence tumor evolution.",Characterization of extrachromosomal DNAs in tumors through computational analysis of single-cell and bulk sequencing data,10302738,R21CA256575,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Cancer Research', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Cell division', 'Cells', 'Centromere', 'Chromosomal Rearrangement', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Double Minutes', 'Evolution', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Oncogenes', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Recurrence', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'daughter cell', 'design', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'extrachromosomal DNA', 'frontier', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'research study', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression', 'whole genome']",NCI,JACKSON LABORATORY,R21,2021,478230
"Exploiting convergent evolution to design biomarker extraction tools for the prediction of therapeutic response in cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The effective treatment of drug resistant tumors represents one of the greatest unmet needs in oncology research. The evolution of therapeutic resistance in cancer is a dynamic process, shaped by many external forces, including selection pressures, microenvironment, and the timescales of clinical treatments. As tumors evolve under these heterogeneous settings, a variety of genotypes emerge and lead to large differences in drug response phenotypes between patients. By grouping tumors based on their response to treatment, we can exploit principles of convergent evolution, where similar phenotypes evolve independently between individuals. In doing so, this work aims to aid precision medicine by identifying commonalities between tumors with similar drug response phenotypes.  Gene expression signatures are a powerful tool that can be used to predict convergent states of drug sensitiv- ity and resistance. Using vast open-source datasets, Aim 1 of this proposal will demonstrate a novel method for extracting and validating gene expression signatures to predict therapeutic response in cancer. Cell lines with the best and worst response to a given drug are pooled and compared using differential gene expression analysis. Genes with increased expression in a state of sensitivity or resistance become seed genes in a co-expression network based on gene expression from tumor samples. From there, only seed genes with strong co-expression within patient samples are extracted to form the ﬁnal gene expression signature. This novel approach integrates clinical sample data to the signature extraction method in order to increase translational value compared to molec- ular signatures extracted using only cell line datasets. Next, Aim 2 of this proposal investigates the phenomenon of collateral sensitivity, where resistance to one drug aligns with sensitivity to another drug. Because the evo- lution of collateral resistance and sensitivity can be unpredictable, molecular signatures of convergent states of collateral sensitivity and resistance could greatly enhance treatment planning once resistance to ﬁrst-line ther- apy has evolved. Using EGFR+ non-small cell lung cancer cell lines as a model system, this project aims to identify molecular signatures of evolutionarily convergent collateral sensitivity/resistance phenotypes during the experimental evolution of therapeutic resistance to targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tumor differences between patients can hinder the prediction of therapeutic response in cancer, as patients with seemingly similar tumors often display varying levels of chemo-sensitivity or -resistance. This work aims to abandon the “one-drug-ﬁts-all” approach and produce a novel method for discovering biomarkers of therapeutic sensitivity and resistance in cancer. Our results will assist clinicians in choosing the best available treatment for each individual patient.",Exploiting convergent evolution to design biomarker extraction tools for the prediction of therapeutic response in cancer,10138410,F30CA257076,"['Ally', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evolution', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Imatinib', 'Individual', 'Inter-tumoral heterogeneity', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Work', 'base', 'bcr-abl Fusion Proteins', 'cancer cell', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'gene product', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Rational translation of gold nanoparticle mediated radiosensitization tothe clinic The use of high atomic number (Z) elements as radiosensitizers of tumors has been well documented in the literature over the last few decades. In particular, gold nanoparticles (GNPs), typically defined as high-Z gold structures with the longest dimension smaller than 100 nm, have been the subject of active investigation for the same purpose for the past 15 years. Early in vivo demonstration of GNP-mediated radiosensitization (GMR) effect was based on passive accumulation of GNPs within tumors (“passive targeting”). While resulting in a remarkable level of GMR, this approach generally requires clinically less relevant radiation quality (low energy kilovoltage x-rays) and clinically unachievable (without direct injection) gold concentration (up to 7mg gold per gram of tumor). To overcome these difficulties, we have been investigating an alternative approach based on “active targeting” which shows a promising outlook for clinical translation in the near term. This proposal seeks to surmount the remaining challenges associated with our active targeting-based approach before embarking on clinical translation of GMR. Specifically, we aim to identify the molecular mechanism of GMR, biodistribution and kinetics of GNPs developed for clinical translation, their fate at the tumor and cellular levels, and the correlation between GNP-mediated dose enhancement and GMR. Despite abundant data and publications on GMR accumulated over the years, critical knowledge gaps still exist in terms of the aforementioned aspects, hindering clinical translation of GMR. As demonstrated in our preliminary data, we propose to address such issues that hold the key for clinical translation of GMR, through concerted multidisciplinary efforts. Upon achieving this goal, a pilot human trial of GNP-enhanced radiation therapy (RT) will also be conducted within this project for the management of recurrent rectal cancer. Overall, we will pursue three Specific Aims shown below to achieve the goals of this project. (1) To determine the molecular mechanism of GMR, the biodistribution/kinetics of GNPs in vitro and in vivo, and the radiosensitization efficacy in clinically relevant treatment scenarios, (2) To correlate GNP-mediated dose enhancement and GMR using high resolution image-based cell/tissue models and nanoscale computational techniques, and (3) To conduct a pilot human trial of GNP-enhanced RT for previously radiated recurrent rectal cancers. Ultimately, this project would lay the foundation for widespread applications of the currently envisioned RT paradigm that enables more potent and tumor-specific RT with less toxicity. Increasing the radiation dose delivered to rectal cancers treated preoperatively can improve pathological response at the time of surgery and possibly even obviate the need for surgery but this has been challenging to implement in the clinic due to the limited radiation tolerance of the surrounding normal intestinal loops. Gold nanoparticles that preferentially accumulate in tumors offer the possibility to increase radiation dose within the tumor without damaging adjacent normal tissues. To amplify this radiation dose enhancement, we propose to advance clinical translation of a paradigm using gold nanoparticles that home to the tumor, get internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, disperse in the cytoplasm via co-administered pharmacological agents, and can be modeled by mathematical techniques that predict the biological consequences of tumor accumulation.",Rational translation of gold nanoparticle mediated radiosensitization tothe clinic,10144062,R01CA257241,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biodistribution', 'Biological', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Double Strand Break Repair', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High-LET Radiation', 'Home', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Injections', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Mediating', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nanotechnology', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmacology', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Radiosensitization', 'Rectal Cancer', 'Recurrence', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Tumor Tissue', 'base', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'dosage', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'ionization', 'irradiation', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoGold', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'radiation response', 'receptor internalization', 'receptor mediated endocytosis', 'response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2021,631688
"FAST-FNA immune cell profiling in HNSCC Currently, the single best predictive biomarker of response to anti-PD1 monotherapy is PD-L1 expression as assessed by immunohistochemical staining of archived or fresh tissue. Current workflows for PD-L1 assessment in tissue are labor and time consuming, are not infallible (inconclusive results in a fraction of image guided biopsies) and are associated with morbidity and are thus rarely performed serially. Rapid on site assessment of cellular, rather than tissue, specimens obtained through fine needle aspiration (FNA) could not only circumvent these bottlenecks but also enable more comprehensive and serial profiling of the tumor microenvironment to obtain the most up-to-date information of a rapidly changing microenvironment during tumor evolution and therapy. The goal of this project is to further develop and validate the new FAST-FNA technology for rapid biomarker discovery and validation in HNSCCs. There are two main aims. In aim 1 we will develop and validate existing and new biomarkers in FNA samples of HNSCC patients (n=100). Specifically we will I) develop and validate new predictive immunotherapeutic biomarkers and ii to determine how well the new FAST-FNA scores correlate with the CPS scores of PD-L1. The goal of the second aim is to translate the above FAST-FNA technology to serial FNA analyses in HNSCC patients receiving anti-PD1 immunotherapy (with or without chemotherapy; n=100). FNA sampling will be performed pre- and on-treatment in order to capture changes in the tumor microenvironment. As the HNSCC field shifts toward increased biomarker testing, we find an unmet clinical need to develop advanced cellular diagnostics in HNSCCs, which will facilitate rapid biomarker analysis, guide therapies and provide “real time” assessment of clinical response. Existing analysis of HNSCC cancer tissues obtained by core biopsy is limited in many aspects. We have developed a new immune and cancer cell profiling technology based on cellular immunocycling. Using fine needle aspirates (FNA) rather than more invasive core biopsies, this method allows frequent and serial profiling on the composition of the tumor microenvironment in HNSCC patients undergoing immunotherapy.",FAST-FNA immune cell profiling in HNSCC,10154199,R01CA257623,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments', 'Clinical assessments', 'Consumption', 'Core Biopsy', 'Diagnostic', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Human', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Needles', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Quality Control', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sedation procedure', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Harvesting', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer cell', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'companion diagnostics', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'therapy outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,670725
"Non-invasive neurosurgical planning with Random Matrix Theory MRI PROJECT SUMMARY About 23,830 people in the US are diagnosed per year with primary malignant brain tumors, and 200,000- 300,000 with metastatic brain tumors (10-30% of all cancers). Maximizing surgical resection of tumor is a major predictor of survival, but must be balanced against the risk of injuring eloquent white matter and cortical regions. To improve outcomes, the unmet need is to radically increase quality of noninvasive preoperative brain mapping. As the brain mapping gold standard, MRI offers unique soft-tissue contrast, anatomical and functional information of the brain, yet is inherently signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-starved. The majority of brain mapping relies on diffusion (dMRI) and functional (fMRI), which are both especially severely limited by SNR. The MRI signal can be increased with higher-field; however, scanner prices scale with the field strength: 1.5T ~ $1.5M, 7T ~ $7M, as do installation and service costs. Since 90% of the MRIs in the US are 1.5T or below, it appears that the majority of hospitals cannot justify or afford high field MRI. SNR increase by the signal averaging is impractical from the scan time perspective, as brain tumor patients rarely tolerate scan times above 45 min. Our company, Microstructure Imaging (MICSI), is an award-winning New York University (NYU) spinoff that offers a software-as-a-service for medical image processing. Our product dramatically enhances the SNR of MRI brain mapping, which translates into increased resolution, image quality, sensitivity and specificity. Here we employ random matrix theory (RMT) to achieve an order-of-magnitude gain in SNR purely in software at the image reconstruction level, by utilizing the information across multiple radiofrequency coils and MRI contrasts within a single protocol. Our overarching goal is to optimize our RMT/MP-PCA image reconstruction algorithm for the clinical translation in brain mapping preoperative studies. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Enabling lower field / higher resolution. We will develop and evaluate a multimodal (dMRI/fMRI) RMT denoising and reconstruction protocol in 6 volunteers on 1.5T and 3T with different image resolutions, and retrospectively in 30 preoperative brain mapping MRI patients. This data will be used to justify prospectively altering clinical MRI protocols during the anticipated Phase II of the STTR. Aim 2: Clinical feasibility study. 15 minutes of additional scan time for dMRI and 2 fMRI tasks at 1.2 mm isotropic resolution will be prospectively added to 10 brain mapping cases at 3T. The image quality with and without denoising will be assessed quantitatively, and qualitatively by radiologists and neurosurgeons. While the Phase-I STTR will optimize RMT in preoperative planning for brain tumors, in the future we will optimize protocols for any tumor type or location by joint RMT reconstruction of variety of MRI modalities (perfusion, T1/T2, dMRI, fMRI) to help them denoise each other and maximize the overall information content. RMT image reconstruction will open MRI to the developing world by bringing high-field quality to inexpensive low-field MRI. PROJECT NARRATIVE A modern MRI scanner is a multi-million-dollar machine, which has become a clinical gold-standard for non- invasive diagnostics and presurgical planning of brain tumors; however, its overarching technological challenge is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ultimately limiting the image resolution and quality in the clinic. To improve diagnostic image quality and increase the resolution, the SNR must be radically increased, which currently entails spending an additional 1-4 million dollars on higher-field scanners, with incremental outcomes. This proposal demonstrates that our innovative denoising and image reconstruction algorithm, based on random matrix theory and implemented purely in software, increases SNR by an order-of-magnitude in clinically relevant structural and functional MRI acquisitions, matching or exceeding the quality of costly hardware investments, and can greatly improve the quality of non-invasive neurosurgical planning for brain tumors.",Non-invasive neurosurgical planning with Random Matrix Theory MRI,10258848,R41CA257624,"['Adoption', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Disinfection', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Excision', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fingers', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neurosurgeon', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Postoperative Period', 'Price', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'contrast imaging', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'density', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'radio frequency', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'software as a service', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'tumor', 'volunteer', 'white matter']",NCI,"MICROSTRUCTURE IMAGING, INC.",R41,2021,399999
"Identifying and Targeting Master Regulators of Drug Resistance in Lung Adenocarcinoma through Network Analysis of Tumor Transcriptomic Data Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States, is responsible for more than 100,000 deaths each year. The treatment of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most common histological subtype of lung cancer, has improved substantially in recent decades through the advent of targeted therapy for tumors with oncogenic driver mutations and immune checkpoint inhibitors for those without. However, up to 50% of metastatic LUAD tumors will not respond to standard-of-care antineoplastic therapy. Previous precision oncology efforts to discover genomic or immunohistochemical biomarkers of LUAD tumor drug sensitivity have achieved limited success. To remedy these shortcomings, we propose to leverage a translational systems biology approach to identify and target the biological determinants of drug resistance in LUAD through network analysis of tumor transcriptomic data. Due to advances in computational biology and next-generation sequencing technologies, the dynamic expression of genes within each patient’s LUAD tumor may be accurately measured, providing a novel window for the identification of the key transcriptional regulatory proteins which initiate and maintain drug-resistant tumor phenotypes (i.e. Master Regulators). The systematic identification of Master Regulator proteins can be achieved with Non-parametric analytical Rank-based Enrichment Analysis (NaRnEA), a newly developed statistical method capable of leveraging context-specific transcriptional regulatory networks to extract highly mechanistic information from LUAD tumor transcriptomic data for in silico precision oncology, thus overcoming the limitations of previous genomic and immunohistochemical approaches. NaRnEA- inferred activity of Master Regulator proteins which coordinate resistance to targeted therapy will be leveraged for the development of a transcriptomic machine learning biomarker of drug-sensitivity. Additionally, one-of-a- kind perturbational gene expression profiles for >400 FDA-approved and investigational compounds in the LUAD cell line NCIH1793 will be interrogated to identify drugs capable of targeting these Master Regulators of drug- resistance using the OncoTreat algorithm, a novel systems biology precision oncology method which has received NYS CLIA certification and is currently in use for multiple clinical trials at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. This translational research project will coincide with simultaneous scientific and clinical training as the applicant studies computational biology and works closely with thoracic oncologists at CUIMC, respectively. Following the completion of this research project the applicant will complete clinical training at the New York Presbyterian Hospital through the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. This combined scientific and medical predoctoral fellowship will prepare the applicant for an Internal Medicine residency and a Hematology/Oncology clinical fellowship culminating in a career as an independent physician- scientist in the field of precision medical oncology. Project Narrative Although lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality each year in the United States, optimal biomarkers for tumor sensitivity to targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors are lacking. Through computational systems biology analyses of lung cancer gene expression data, we propose to identify and pharmacologically target Master Regulator proteins which coordinate resistance to these treatment modalities. The activity of these Master Regulators, which can be inferred in silico for the development of predictive machine learning biomarkers of drug sensitivity in lung cancer, will be abrogated in vitro and in vivo using FDA-approved and investigational compounds to destabilize drug-resistant phenotypes, thereby improving the quantity and quality of life for patients diagnosed with this deadly disease.",Identifying and Targeting Master Regulators of Drug Resistance in Lung Adenocarcinoma through Network Analysis of Tumor Transcriptomic Data,10315207,F30CA257765,"['A549', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'FDA approved', 'Fellowship', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Hematology', 'Histologic', 'Hospitals', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunocompetent', 'In Vitro', 'Internal Medicine', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Oncology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Mutate', 'New York', 'Oncogenic', 'Oncologist', 'Oncoproteins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residencies', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surgeon', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transcription Regulatory Protein', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer subtypes', 'career', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer studies', 'driver mutation', 'drug sensitivity', 'genomic biomarker', 'high throughput analysis', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'learning classifier', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'pre-doctoral', 'precision oncology', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'standard of care', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2021,46060
"SCH: Personalized Rescheduling of Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Head & Neck Cancer Head and neck cancers (HNCs) account for nearly 3% of all cancers in the U.S. and most commonly affect aging individuals. While chemo-radiotherapy is the standard treatment approach for HNC, the method is known to cause substantial side-effects. In particular, anatomical changes occurring during the treatment may result in under-coverage of the clinical target volume or over-dosage of organs at risk. The project will develop novel optimization models for Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) – a customized treatment planning approach for individual patients designed by evaluating the systematic and random variations in tumor response. The models will use imaging data of tumor volume and normal tissue complication probabilities to determine the optimal number and timing of treatment replans. The models will provide personalized optimization through sequential decision-making based on response to treatment, as well as optimization and evaluation of simple threshold replanning policies often used by doctors. Optimal behavior in the face of conflicting payer/provider perspectives for emerging technologies will also be analyzed using mechanism design techniques. ART requires information about patient-state as well as transition probabilities describing the tumor's evolution over time. Since the process inherently calls for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, the proposed optimization models use a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The resulting optimal policies may be difficult to implement in practice, especially in centers lacking state-of-the-art equipment. Therefore, the proposed work will further evaluate simple threshold replanning policies using a bilevel programming framework. In particular, the bilevel program will find threshold values for various patient classes by minimizing the deviation from the MDP-prescribed policy. The proposed framework offers multiple avenues for methodological contributions. The novel MDP design framework is an incredibly powerful tool that can be used to model many interesting questions. We will explore ways of discretizing the continuous state spaces and estimating transition probabilities based on patient imaging data. We will explore algorithms for solving bilevel programs, especially utilizing the structure and properties of the lower-level MDP models. Finally, we will study applications of the principal-agent framework from economics in modeling payer/provider interactions for emerging clinical therapies. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This study uses novel models to develop and validate an integrated approach to reduce cancer radiotherapy side effects while maintaining or improving cancer control. It will maximize efficiency for patients and providers. Its findings will inform decisions about individual radiation planning, optimize risk- stratified treatment, and healthcare policy implementation of effective new technology interventions. n/a",SCH: Personalized Rescheduling of Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Head & Neck Cancer,10167245,R01CA257814,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Capital', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Complication', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Head Cancer', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Linear Accelerator Radiotherapy Systems', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Malignant neoplasm of pharynx', 'Medical Device', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck Cancer', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operations Research', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SMART health', 'Science', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Volume', 'Uncertain Risk', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical implementation', 'connected health', 'cost', 'design', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'improved', 'in silico', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'low and middle-income countries', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'models and simulation', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'radiation-induced injury', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'side effect', 'soft tissue', 'standard care', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,256795
"Applying deep learning to predict T cell receptor binding specificity of neoantigens and response to checkpoint inhibitors Project Summary Background: In-depth study of neoantigens will promote our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of basic immunology and immune-related disease processes, such as response to cancer immunotherapy. Neoantigens play a key role in the recognition of tumor cells by T cells and are increasingly shown to be targets of checkpoint inhibitor-induced immune response. However, several missing links exist in neoantigen research. (1) Only a small proportion of neoantigens can elicit T cell responses. It is even less clear which neoantigens will be recognized by which specific T cell receptor (TCR). (2) Although neoantigens are important during the course of action of immunotherapies, how neoantigen repertoire data can be used to predict patient response is only poorly understood. (3) The lack of standardized analysis pipelines and limited sharing of neoantigen data have hindered efficient and consistent research in the tumor immunogenomics field. Aim 1: Build a transfer learning-based model to predict immunogenicity of neoantigens. So far, only a very limited number of reports have created predictive models determining whether a neoantigen/MHC complex can elicit any T cell response. Even fewer of them are capable of predicting the TCR-binding specificity of neoantigens. However, the capability to predict the overall immunogenicity and the TCR-binding specificity of neoantigens is critical for improving the benefit of immunotherapy. Aim 1 addresses this challenge with advanced transfer learning algorithms, followed by benchmarking and laboratory validations. Aim 2: Predict response to checkpoint inhibitors by integration of the immunogenicity and other properties of all neoantigens in a patient, through a Bayesian multi-instance learning model. To date, most studies have focused on the neoantigen/mutation load approach in correlation with response of patients to immunotherapy administration. This simplistic approach misses the rich information contained in the whole repertoire of neoantigens per patient and has been successful in only a few studies, but not others. Aim 2 addresses this important inadequacy by creating a Bayesian multi-instance learning model that fully considers various quality features, including immunogenicity, of all neoantigens in a patient for prediction of treatment response. Aim 3: Create a web portal to provide neoantigen-related computational services and to share neoantigen data. The PI will establish a public webserver providing cloud-based standardized services, including prediction of neoantigens and the advanced analysis methods developed in Aim 1 and 2. The webserver will openly share neoantigen/TCR and patient phenotype data, in accordance with IRB and HIPAA regulations. Expected impact: (1) This project will predict the immunogenicity of neoantigens, which could inform neoantigen vaccine development. (2) This project will predict response to checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy based on patient neoantigen profiles. (3) The neoantigen database will propel research and also lead to clinical applications for cancers and other immune-related diseases, such as COVID-19. Project Narrative We will develop deep learning-based models to predict the TCR binding specificity of neoantigens/MHC complexes (immunogenicity). We will predict patient response to checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy based on immunogenicity and other properties of neoantigens. We will build a comprehensive neoantigen webserver, which will facilitate a coordinated effort to accelerate tumor immunogenomics research and clinical applications for personalized medicine.",Applying deep learning to predict T cell receptor binding specificity of neoantigens and response to checkpoint inhibitors,10180781,R01CA258584,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'COVID-19', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MHC antigen', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publications', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'data sharing networks', 'deep learning', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning algorithm', 'neglect', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'statistics', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vaccine development', 'web portal']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,378897
"Multi-scale modeling of glioma for the prediction of treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation Project summary Computational multi-scale modeling is a growing area of research that aims to link whole slide images and radiographic iamges with multi-omics molecular profiles of the same patients. Multi-scale modeling has shown its potential through its ability to predict clinical outcomes e.g. prognosis, and through predicting actionable molecular properties of tumors, e.g. the activity of EGFR, a major drug target in many cancers. Current applications are limited to study associations between imaging and molecular data, and predicting long term outcomes. No actionable information can be gained from multi-scale biomarkers yet. We propose to develop a multi-scale modeling framework to support treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation for patients with brain tumors, focusing on the most aggressive subtype of glioma, IDH wild-type high grade glioma. In Aim 1, we will develop informatics algorithms that integrate multi-scale data for treatment response. We will use our expertise in data fusion and develop novel approaches to integrate multi- scale data to predict first line treatment response. In Aim 2, we will develop algorithms that allow combining multi-scale data at diagnosis with multi-modal MR imaging data during treatment follow-up. We will focus on predicting treatment response and progression and whether we can predict these events earlier than radiologists can. In Aim 3, we will develop algorithms that use the multi-scale data to predict drug target activities and also suggest novel drugs for patients that become resistant to first line treatment. We will use a mixture of publicly available glioma multi-scale data sets totaling more than 1000 patients, and also 1600 retrospective and 150 prospective brain tumor patients from Stanford Medical Center. Combining these complementary data sources in a multi-scale framework for data fusion can have profound contributions toward predicting treatment outcomes by uncovering unknown synergies and relationships. More specifically, developing computational models integrating quantitative image features and molecular data to develop multi-scale signatures, holds the potential to translate in benefit to brain tumor patients by investigating biomarkers that accurately predict treatment response. Readily, because whole slide images and radiographic imaging is part of the routine diagnostic work-up of cancer patients and molecular data of brain tumors is increasingly being used in clinical workflows, therefore if reliable multi-scale signatures can be found reflecting treatment response, translation to clinical applications is feasible, including optimizing recruitment for clinical trials. Narrative We propose a multi-scale framework for treatment allocation, treatment follow-up and treatment monitoring to provide precision medicine for brain tumor patients. We will develop algorithms integrating clinical, molecular and imaging data for therapeutic purposes. We will focus on the development of multi-scale biomarkers that are predictive of treatment response, suggest the use of novel drugs and help during treatment monitoring.","Multi-scale modeling of glioma for the prediction of treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation",10184938,R01CA260271,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Repair Enzymes', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Link', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer site', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data framework', 'data fusion', 'digital pathology', 'epigenetic silencing', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'methylation pattern', 'molecular imaging', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'multiscale data', 'mutational status', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathology imaging', 'patient biomarkers', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'recruit', 'response', 'survival outcome', 'survival prediction', 'synergism', 'temozolomide', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,612041
"Evaluation of treatment predictors reflecting beta-catenin activation in hepatocellular carcinoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and its incidence is rising in both men and women in the United States. Anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) antibodies are now FDA approved for advanced HCC, however, as few as 20% of patients receiving these agents will show an objective response to therapy. Because immune-related adverse events are non-trivial, predictive biomarkers that can explain the variability in immunotherapy response are needed to optimize patient selection.  Several lines of research have recently converged to associate oncogenic activation of the Wnt/beta- catenin signaling pathway with tumor immune-evasion and poor clinical response to ICI therapy in HCC. In previous research, we found that HCC exhibiting high uptake of the positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging agent 18F- fluorocholine (FCH) often belonged to molecular tumor sub-types associated with beta-catenin activation and immune avoidance. Liquid biopsy based on targeted sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has also made it possible to identify patients who have tumors that harbor mutations associated with increased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.  This project comprises a phase 2 biomarker clinical trial to prospectively evaluate these specific embodiments of PET/CT and liquid biopsy as tools for detecting HCC recalcitrant to ICI therapy on the basis of beta-catenin activation. In addition to characterizing and comparing the predictive capabilities of FCH PET/CT and cfDNA mutation profiling based on phase 2 clinical endpoints, this project will utilize decision tree based machine learning to estimate the predictive performance of an integrative imaging-genomic biomarker while also further examining how tumor mutations are related to PET metabolic phenotype and immunotherapy response. Furthermore, because tumor 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake is incongruent with FCH uptake in HCC, a third aim will utilize the trial as a molecular screening process to create an enriched sub-cohort of patients with FDG-avid tumors. These patients will undergo serial FDG PET/CT to evaluate FDG as a source of predictive biomarkers of ICI response for an orthogonal molecular sub-type of HCC. If these diagnostic tests are found reliable at predicting tumor resistance/response, they could significantly enhance the clinical precision and overall benefit of immunotherapy for HCC and possibly other cancers. PROJECT NARRATIVE  While immune-checkpoint inhibitor antibodies are a major advance in cancer treatment, only a minority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (the most common form of primary liver cancer) will benefit from this form of immunotherapy. This project comprises a phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging and DNA sequencing based liquid biopsy as diagnostic tools for predicting resistance to immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal is to determine whether using these tests can potentially increase a patient’s chance of receiving a drug that will help them.",Evaluation of treatment predictors reflecting beta-catenin activation in hepatocellular carcinoma,10277385,R01CA262460,"['Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Effectiveness', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Induced Mutation', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minority', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor Markers', 'United States', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'advanced disease', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-PD-L1', 'antibody inhibitor', 'base', 'beta catenin', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cancer therapy', 'cell free DNA', 'checkpoint therapy', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'determinants of treatment resistance', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging agent', 'imaging biomarker', 'immune-related adverse events', 'improved', 'liquid biopsy', 'melanoma', 'men', 'metabolic phenotype', 'migration', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'mutational status', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'objective response rate', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,QUEEN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,520008
"Reviving cancer immune surveillance with CD4 T cell help Abstract The immune system is capable of eliminating advanced malignant tumors, yet cancer immunotherapy success has been limited to a subset of cancer types. Conventional CD4, or `helper', T cells play an integral role in orchestrating immune responses, and can potentiate the function of antitumor immunity: both via activation and potentiation of antigen presenting cell function and antitumor CD8 T cells. My postdoctoral work demonstrated that reactivating childhood vaccine-specific CD4 T cells after intratumor injection of recall antigen (e.g. polio capsid or tetanus toxoid), mediates antitumor efficacy and causes both innate and adaptive inflammation within tumors. The antitumor efficacy of intratumor recall responses were partially dependent upon CD8 T cells, and coincided with infiltration of activated granulocytic macrophages with phenotypes distinct from tumor associated macrophages after direct innate stimulation with Poly IC. Thus, inducing CD4 T cell recall represents a novel therapeutic opportunity, with a distinct mode of inflammatory and antitumor potential. We hypothesize that intratumor childhood vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell recall responses instigate distinct and durable inflammatory reprograming of myeloid cells to potentiate antitumor CD8+ T cell function and mediate antitumor efficacy. To test this hypothesis, we will define reprogramming of innate immunity after triggering intratumor recall responses and determine its role in mediating antitumor efficacy (Aim 1) and test if polio vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell recall responses `help' antitumor CD8+ T cells (Aim 2). These analyses will inform clinically actionable routes to develop recall antigen-based therapies that enlist CD4 T cell help within tumors (the goal of the independent, R00 phase). The clinical translation of these findings will be informed by identifying therapeutic strategies, such as combined innate pattern recognition receptor agonist therapy, that may synergize with recall antigens in mediating systemic antitumor efficacy; as well as identifying more targeted molecular routes to recapitulate CD4 T cell help in tumors therapeutically (Aim 3). The K99 phase of this work will be mentored by several distinguished experts in tumor immunobiology and cancer immunotherapy: including Drs. Darell Bigner (primary Mentor, cancer immunotherapy of brain tumors), Simon Gregory (computational expert), Qi Jing-Li (T cell biologist using transcriptome analyses to gauge T cell function), Amy Heimberger (tumor associated myeloid cell expert who has previously applied transcriptome analyses to define activation/suppressive features of tumor associated myeloid cells), and James Herndon II (biostatistical support). This proposal will enable clinical translation of recall antigens to cancer patients and will seed a research program that leverages the potent immune-stimulating effects of CD4+ T cell help to develop novel cancer therapies. Project Narrative CD4+ T cell help is required for optimal effector CD8+ T cell function; however, therapies that enlist CD4+ T cells for cancer immunotherapy are lacking.

"Developing Safe and Effective GD2-CAR T Cell Therapy for Diffuse Midline Gliomas PROJECT SUMMARY Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer related death in children; among these, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and other histone-3 K27M (H3K27M) mutated diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are the most aggressive and are universally fatal with current standard therapies. Despite several decades of investigational trials testing dozens of therapeutic approaches, median overall survival for DIPG is 11 months. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T-cells have mediated impressive clinical activity in B-cell malignancies, and recent preclinical and early clinical results suggest benefit in CNS malignancies. We discovered homogenous, high overexpression of the GD2 ganglioside on H3K27M DMGs and demonstrated impressive antitumor effects in xenograft models of H3K27M-mutant DIPG following treatment with GD2-CAR T cells (GD2-CART, Mount, Nat Med 2018). Significant clinical experience with GD2 targeting CAR T cells, available mostly from studies in neuroblastoma, demonstrate safety and some early signals of antitumor activity. Safe and effective translation of these findings to children with DMGs would transform the landscape for this universally lethal pediatric brain tumor. This bench-to-bedside-to-bench project will conduct three aims in parallel leveraging a recently launched single institution Phase I trial of GD2.BB.z.iCasp9-CAR T cells administered intravenously following a lymphodepleting preparative regimen in children and young adults with H3K27M DMGs. The first aim focuses on safety, integrating insights gleaned in our preclinical models into trial design to diminish the risk of tumor inflammation associated neurotoxicity (TIAN), to establish best practices and to develop improved grading and treatment algorithms for this novel toxicity. The second aim focuses on efficacy, assessing clinical activity of GD2-CART in DMG and identifying biomarkers and clinical features associated with response. We further address the limitations of standard radiographic imaging in these infiltrative tumors using a novel machine learning aided MRI radiomics approach to quantify textural changes within the tumor and assess whether such changes correlate with clinical outcome, and we assess whether GD2-CART induced changes in CSF cell free DNA can provide a rapid quantitative assessment of antitumor response. Our third aim is a discovery aim, focused on improving understanding of the biology associated with myeloid cell activation following GD2-CART therapy for DMGs, which we observe in preclinical models and we observed in the first patient treated. Here we undertake comprehensive single cell profiling of CSF myeloid cells emerging post-GD2-CART in patients enrolled on the study and in preclinical models, and bedside-to-bench translation using murine models to test the hypotheses that GD2-CART induced CNS myeloid cell expansion/activation limit the efficacy of GD2-CART, are modulated by corticosteroid therapy and that this obstacle can be overcome by engineering CD47 overexpression in the GD2-CART. PROJECT NARRATIVE: CAR based immunotherapies are now credentialed as potent tools against hematologic malignancies and early signals suggest that these therapeutics may prove beneficial against brain tumors. Building upon impressive results in preclinical models, this project will undertake a Phase I trial of GD2-CAR T cells in H3K27M diffuse midline gliomas, universally lethal tumors of childhood and young adults. The project seeks to ensure the safety of this therapy for patients with brainstem gliomas where the risk of toxicity due to tumor edema is high, will use novel approaches to measure clinical efficacy and seek to define biomarkers or response, and will undertake studies focused on interrogating the biology of myeloid cell activation following CNS directed CAR T cell therapies that has been observed both in preclinical and clinical studies.",Developing Safe and Effective GD2-CAR T Cell Therapy for Diffuse Midline Gliomas,10279921,R01CA263500,"['Address', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain Stem Glioma', 'Brain Stem Neoplasms', 'CAR T cell therapy', 'CD47 gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Brain Neoplasm', 'Childhood Malignant Brain Tumor', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Coin', 'Collaborations', 'Credentialing', 'Data', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffuse', 'Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Edema', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Ganglioside GD2', 'Glean', 'Glioma', 'H3 K27M mutation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Intravenous', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Myelogenous', 'Myeloid Cell Activation', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preparation', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Radiation therapy', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Standardization', 'Supportive care', 'Survival Rate', 'Swelling', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Xenograft Model', 'aged', 'antitumor effect', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cell free DNA', 'childhood cancer mortality', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'clinical efficacy', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'macrophage', 'mouse model', 'neuro-oncology', 'neurosurgery', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'participant safety', 'phase I trial', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'radiomics', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'tumor immunology', 'young adult']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,671445
"Automated Presurgical Language Mapping via Deep Learning for Multimodal Brain Connectivity Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 100,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with a primary brain tumor each year. Neu- rosurgery remains the ﬁrst and most common therapeutic option for these patients with outcomes linked to the extent of tumor resection. However, larger resections also increase the risk for postoperative deﬁcits, particularly in the motor and language areas of the eloquent cortex. Task fMRI (t-fMRI) has emerged as a powerful nonin- vasive tool for preoperative mapping, but these acquisitions are lengthy and cognitively demanding for patients. Moreover, t-fMRI is unreliable if the patient cannot perform the tasks while in the scanner. Our long-term goal is to develop an automated platform for reliable eloquent cortex mapping across a broad patient cohort that comple- ments the existing clinical workﬂow. The overall objective of this proposal is to design and validate new machine learning algorithms that leverage the complementary strengths of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (d-MRI), which are both passive modalities and easy to acquire. Our central hypothesis is that the combined structural-functional connectivity information in these modalities will enable us to localize language functionality in patients with brain tumors. Our innovative strategy uses recent advancements in deep learning to capture com- plex interactions in the rs-fMRI and d-MRI data that collectively deﬁne the language areas. We will evaluate our hypothesis via two speciﬁc aims. In Aim 1 we will develop a graph neural network (GNN) that employs specialized convolutional ﬁlters to capture topological properties of the connectivity data across multiple scales. Our GNN will be trained in a supervised fashion and evaluated against t-fMRI activations and intraoperative electrocortical stimulation. In Aim 2 we will conduct an exploratory analysis to retrospectively link our GNN predictions to post- operative changes in language functionality. Namely, we hypothesize that patients for whom the surgical path intersects our GNN predictions will experience greater deﬁcits across ﬁne-grained language subdomains. We will also assess the prognostic value of our GNN predictions, as compared to other clinical factors. We anticipate the proposed research will have a transformative impact on surgical planning by helping neurosurgeons to plan more targeted and safer surgeries, thus improving patient outcomes and overall quality of care. Project Narrative The proposed research addresses a critical and unmet public health need in managing primary brain tumors by improving the accuracy of eloquent cortex mapping during preoperative planning. The algorithms developed through these efforts will help to streamline the surgical procedures and mitigate the risk for postoperative deﬁcits, towards the ultimate goal of improving both quality of care and long-term clinical outcomes.",Automated Presurgical Language Mapping via Deep Learning for Multimodal Brain Connectivity,10286181,R21CA263804,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Network-based', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Postoperative Period', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Seeds', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'cortex mapping', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilayer perceptron', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neurosurgery', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prognostic value', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'white matter']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,221368
"UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network v2.0 ABSTRACT Tumor heterogeneity -- the complex mix of tumor subclones, the cell-of-origin that first became transformed, the evolution of tumor subclones under selective pressures of the body and due to treatment, and the interplay of these cells with the tumor microenvironment (TME) -- contributes to the character, behavior, and mystery of tumors and is a key determinant of cancer progression and a patient’s response to therapy. Large-scale genomics projects like the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genome Data Analysis Network (GDAN) have revealed important characteristics and patterns from a multi-omics overview of various tumor types. However, it remains a mystery on how to maximize the use of these data to choose the best course of treatment for an individual patient. The proposed GDAN will close this gap in knowledge by collecting clinical information and outcomes endpoints alongside the multiple omics platforms that will provide key linkages upon which to train supervised computational approaches. We propose to contribute our key competencies of pathway analysis, integrative machine-learning, mRNA-seq analysis, assessment of driving somatic mutations, and visualization of high-throughput datasets to serve the future GDAN analysis working groups (AWGs) to achieve these goals. We will collect and share widely a database of gene expression signatures that capture cell state information gleaned from the large collection of single-cell mRNA sequencing data such as from the Human Cell Atlas (Aim 1). In addition, we will contribute our existing, and novel extensions to, machine-learning approaches like AKIMATE to maximally use these signatures and others in combination with AWG-approved omics datasets as features to train accurate predictors of response for the GDAN’s studies like ALCHEMIST (Aim 2). Our proposal will adapt the TumorMap to benefit weekly analysis and bolster the exploration and publication of results. Specifically, we will work with the group to create new maps that show the TME and TIC comparisons of the patient samples separately to help elucidate new important subtypes implied by the collected data (Aim 3). As we have done for the past twelve years for TCGA and the GDAN, we propose to continue working closely with the consortium in these endeavors to significantly enrich our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of tumor heterogeneity and its influence on cancer progression and treatment response. PROJECT NARRATIVE The wealth of multiple-omics datasets produced by the Cancer Genome Atlas and NCI’s Genome Data Analysis Network have set the stage to understand and predict health outcomes for cancer patients. Our proposal would contribute to the future GDAN to apply computational approaches that unite these data with the growing information contained in new single-cell datasets to provide key information about the types of cells that comprise a tumor and its microenvironment through the use of mRNA gene expression signatures. We will share new results of the GDAN through the TumorMap and Xena Browsers to support exploration of the data through collaborations with Analysis Working groups and work with the consortium to define state-of-the-art machine-learning methods to predict therapy response in new clinical trial datasets.",UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network v2.0,10300936,U24CA264009,"['Address', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genome', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Prognosis', 'Publications', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Supervision', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data exploration', 'gene expression database', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'mRNA sequencing', 'machine learning method', 'multiple omics', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient response', 'predicting response', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'single cell mRNA sequencing', 'survival outcome', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'working group']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2021,412872
"Deep exploration of drivers, evolution, and microenvironment toward discovering principal themes in cancer Summary/Abstract Tremendous progress on cancer has been made at the molecular level over the past decade, largely due to the broad application of high throughput, large-scale bulk whole genome, exome and RNA sequencing. In particular, the discovery of numerous medium to high-penetrance drivers, characterization of pathogenic germline variants, and the revelation of many-to-many relationships of genes and pathways, have brought a fuller view of the combinatorial complexity of cancer. Indeed, newer technologies, like single-cell and spatial genomics methods, are now augmenting bulk sequence data to power deeper studies of cancer dynamics, such as heterogeneity, evolution, and interaction with the microenvironment. The current view is that such advanced data, augmented by improved bioinformatics analysis tools and larger, well-curated cohorts will enable medicine to push beyond statistical descriptions toward a genuine deterministic understanding of cancer. Toward this goal, our proposal seeks to extend and apply established bioinformatics systems to integrate the above technologies and leverage our broad range of capabilities and to support the NCI Genomic Characterization Network (NCI-GCN) and Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG) via three specific aims: (1) annotating and interpreting coding and non-coding somatic and germline alterations, (2) characterizing tumor cell populations, evolution, and the tumor microenvironment, and (3) unlocking biological and clinical insights at both the individual and cross-cancer (Pan-Cancer) levels to discern basic themes across the major human cancers. Our approach involves fluencies in four areas of core competence outlined in the program RFA: DNA mutations, long-read sequence analysis, scRNA-Seq analysis, and spatial genomics data analysis (with connection to digital imaging analysis). Project Narrative Understanding the whole spectrum of inherited and acquired genetic changes using established and emerging technologies will lead to effective diagnosis and treatment strategies for each patient's cancer. We undertake this work using a comprehensive suite of established bioinformatics tools to examine mutations and germline predisposition, tumor cell populations, evolution, and the tumor microenvironment; and integrate these dynamics into larger themes in cancer.","Deep exploration of drivers, evolution, and microenvironment toward discovering principal themes in cancer",10301100,U24CA264010,"['ATAC-seq', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Production', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Splicing', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Somatic Mutation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Traction', 'Trees', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'XCL1 gene', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data exchange', 'deep learning', 'digital imaging', 'disorder subtype', 'exome sequencing', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'programs', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'whole genome']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,410850
"The MSK Genomic Data Analysis Center for Tumor Evolution Abstract The MSK Genomic Data Analysis Center for Tumor Evolution seeks to implement tools, best practices and analytical workflows for studying cancer evolution from cancer genome and transcriptome sequencing data. Over the last 15 years, survey sequencing of patient populations of many cancer types has elucidated novel driver mutations which are mechanistically responsible for disease pathogenesis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and individual laboratory efforts have broadened the understanding of biological processes impacted by somatic mutation and revealed new therapeutic targets that have achieved clinical impact. However, most of this work has been based on bulk DNA sequencing from primary tumors and single biopsies from patients. It is well understood that cancer is an evolutionary process during which clonal expansions within patients generates heterogeneity and phenotypic diversity of cell populations across metastatic sites over time (with or without therapeutic intervention). Indeed, the same targeted therapies developed based on mutation discoveries often select for resistant clones, keeping durable cures out of reach. We will develop analytical methods, tools and software infrastructure to study cancer progression through the lens of evolution, shifting emphasis from analysis of primary tumors to dynamic analyses over clinical trajectories. We expect our program will advance the ability to study clinical trajectories of patients in a more comprehensive approach, including temporal, spatial and single cell analysis to better represent the full clonal repertoires of tumors and to study the determinants of how and why tumors evolve. We use tools, well established in our laboratories, in three key areas: i) variant interpretation from metastatic and post-treatment samples for discovery of therapeutic resistance mutations (Aim 1); ii) multi- sample analysis across anatomic space, and/or time series data from serial biopsy or cell free DNA to track and model clonal dynamics (Aim 2); iii) single cell approaches for clonal decomposition and clone-specific phenotyping within patients (Aim 3). Our team is well positioned to carry out our objectives having developed leading software infrastructures supporting TCGA and clinical sequencing through MSK-IMPACT, development of clinically approved assays for longitudinal monitoring of patients through cell free DNA sequencing (MSK- ACCESS) and through study of clonal evolution at bulk and single cell resolution. We will implement and improve tools to support each of these aims, including Cancer Hotspots, OncoKB, and cBioPortal for Aim 1, PyClone and fitClone for Aim 2 and CloneAlign and CellAssign for Aim 3, tailoring and customizing software to support investigations into the dynamic and evolutionary nature of human cancers. These tools comprise a software infrastructure focused on cancer evolution through variant allele interpretation, multi-sample analysis and single cell investigation. Our infrastructure will enable researchers to automate evolutionary interpretation of disease dynamics to better understand the clinical end points of metastatic progression and therapeutic resistance. Narrative: The MSK Genomic Data Analysis Center for Tumor Evolution will create a software platform for analysis of DNA mutations in cancer to help researchers and clinicians better understand why cancers often relapse. As cancer is a disease that changes at the cellular level over time, with some cells killed by treatment while others survive, we need to understand which mutations lead to treatment failure in specific patients. We expect that with improved tools that can measure, monitor and interpret changes in disease over time, we will make advances that allow for better management of cancer and prevention of relapse.",The MSK Genomic Data Analysis Center for Tumor Evolution,10301939,U24CA264028,"['Aftercare', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'ClinVar', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Computer software', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Characteristics', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Ploidies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'RNA', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cBioPortal', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer type', 'cell free DNA', 'cell killing', 'cell type', 'clinical development', 'clinical sequencing', 'data visualization', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'fitness', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'longitudinal analysis', 'multimodality', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision oncology', 'programs', 'resistance mutation', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'software infrastructure', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'therapy resistant', 'time use', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression', 'whole genome']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U24,2021,424800
"Characterizing mechanisms and consequences of intergenic transcription in human cancers Abstract  Interpreting the role of intergenic sequences in tumor development remains an active area of research critical to understand the overall influence of germline and somatic mutations on disease progression. Recent studies have shown transcription and translation at ostensibly non-coding regions in different cell types, and our own analysis of published datasets across cancer cell lines and patient tumors have revealed extensive intergenic transcription and translation, particularly at or near structural variants (SVs). Given that SVs often fuse genic and intergenic regions together, they are a plausible cause for several intergenic transcription and translation events, and identifying such links would help establish a significant downstream consequence of genomic instability and indicate how intergenic regions could shape tumor biology.  In Aim 1, we will develop a machine learning method to estimate the causal effect of SV presence within a locus upon local intergenic transcription and compute such estimates across large public databases of tumor genomes and transcriptomes. This aim will seek to address two outstanding problems in linking somatic mutations to gene expression: (a) non-linear relationships between mutational load and expression magnitude, and (b) the relative rarity of SVs compared to smaller somatic variation that can complicate causal inference.  In Aim 2, we will explore the role of nonsense mediated decay (NMD) in shaping the observed expression levels of intergenic and fusion transcripts, particularly if the fusion transcript involves at least one intergenic partner. Building on past studies studying how mutant transcripts evade NMD, we will determine whether such predictions can explain observed variation in expression of SV-linked or standalone intergenic transcripts across samples. By exploring the role of NMD, we will provide new insights into how intergenic and SV-generated transcripts persist within the tumor transcriptome.  Finally, in Aim 3, we will analyze the landscape of SV-linked and standalone intergenic transcripts from published datasets in which patients are treated with PD-1 or CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors. We will determine whether an increased burden of intergenic transcription is associated with elevated immune infiltration and inflammatory pathway activation and whether SVs that generate intergenic transcripts are linked to improved clinical benefit. We will also test whether expression levels of transcripts predicted to evade NMD are also associated with increased immune responses upon checkpoint inhibition. By analyzing immunotherapy data, we can establish whether SV-linked or standalone intergenic transcription serves as a useful correlate for improved clinical responses.  In summary, this study will develop computational approaches to test hypotheses on how intergenic transcripts are generated and maintained and whether they are useful for immunotherapy. This research will contribute new insights into the causes and consequences of intergenic alterations in the tumor genome. Project Narrative The genomes of cancer cells contain thousands of mutations, requiring specialized methods to determine how these mutations alter gene expression and tumor state. We have found that many cancer cells general novel RNA sequences arising from genomic regions without any known genes, and we hypothesize that such events may arise as a result of large-scale genomic rearrangements and evade normal cellular mechanisms to suppress aberrant RNA. We will develop computational tools to identify which kinds of genomic alterations result in these novel RNA sequences, what features help these sequences persist in the tumor, and whether these sequences influence the response to immunotherapy.",Characterizing mechanisms and consequences of intergenic transcription in human cancers,10312586,F31CA264958,"['Address', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'CCND1 gene', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune signaling', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammatory', 'Intercistronic Region', 'Intergenic Sequence', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonsense-Mediated Decay', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'information model', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'response', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2021,33858
"SBIR Phase I Topic 402 -  Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring This project aims to develop an interpretable, physician-in-the-loop AI-aided software that accurately delineates glioma boundaries in MRIs, computes volumetric curves, and statistically quantifies the tumor growth in longitudinal studies. The current clinical practice of visually analyzing and manually contouring tumors is subjective, time-consuming, and often inconsistent. The novelty of MRIMath's explainable, trustworthy, and physician-in-the-loop AI system is multi-fold. First, we introduce a multi-scale feature extraction framework using the inception modules in contracting and expanding paths of the U-Net image segmentation neural network architecture. Second, we propose a new loss function based on the modified Dice similarity coefficient. Third, we train and test the AI system using two learning regimes: learning to segment intra-tumoral structures and learning to segment glioma sub-regions. Finally, we produce heat maps to visualize the features extracted by the AI, thus offering physicians a view of AI's attention patterns and activation maps that were triggered during AI's decision-making. An intuitive and interactive User Interface will allow the physician to review contouring results, make adjustments and approve contours, visualize AI's explanations and volumetric measurements, and finally review the results of the statistical analysis. Any modifications made by the physician will be used later to re-train AI. n/a","SBIR Phase I Topic 402 -  Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring",10433810,5N91020C00049,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Glioma', 'Human', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer prevention', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging software', 'imaging system', 'loss of function', 'neural network architecture', 'prototype', 'trustworthiness', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'usability']",NCI,"MRIMATH, LLC",N43,2021,55000
