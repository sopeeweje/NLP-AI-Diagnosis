"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome-Wide Association Studies One promise of precision medicine for Alzheimer’s disease is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association in subjects ascertained with and without Alzheimer’s. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine for Alzheimer’s by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual Alzheimer’s patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to Alzheimer’s clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial Alzheimer’s data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on Alzheimer’s patients derived from a population-level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and Alzheimer’s disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the Alzheimer’s clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated Alzheimer’s knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source to the Alzheimer’s disease research community (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of Alzheimer’s disease result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help Alzheimer’s clinicians and researchers connect population-level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat Alzheimer’s patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome-Wide Association Studies,10284977,R01LM010098,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Time', 'base', 'data preservation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'virtual', 'virtual intervention']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,391879
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,10119275,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'noninvasive brain stimulation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,470083
"AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers ABSTRACT In response to NOT-AG-20-034, the proposed Alzheimer’s-focused supplement will develop Connecting Audio And Radio Sensing Systems To Improve Care At Home for persons with early Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD) and their caregivers. The research proposed in this supplement aligns with the parent R01 study (R01LM013329). Persons with ADRD and their caregivers routinely confront various complex challenges and experience huge care burden. A common practice in technology-assisted care intervention is to guide patients and family caregivers through web and mobile phone-based training, health-vital monitoring, symptom reporting, and providing feedback and advice. These intervention programs, while have been shown to be effective, have three major demerits. First, a member of the care team (the patient or a family member) has to actively measure and enter patient data into the system, which is error-prone, subjective, and sometimes, forgotten. Second, web or mobile-based interactions can be cumbersome and demanding. Simple tasks like entering data, assessing health status, or getting and responding to an alert require typing and clicking through a series of electronic forms. Third, interactions between the system and the caregiver, especially when the system needs to remind or confirm an intervention, simple notifications and messages on a smartphone/website is often ineffective and unnoticed. To improve technology-based care interventions and to better serve persons with ADRD and their caregivers, the proposed study will adopt a user-centered approach to adapt and extend the AURA system that we have been developing in our ongoing R01. The research aims are: 1) Increase the robustness of the AURA subsystems; 2) Engage stakeholders (persons with early ADRD, caregivers, clinicians) to identify the needs of ADRD care and caregiving to help co-produce AURA-ALZ for persons with early ADRD and their caregivers; 3) Determine the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of AURA-ALZ in 10 persons with early ADRD and caregiver dyads' homes using mixed methods. Our current R01 aims to develop a technology- assisted AURA system for patients who are post-surgical treatment for bladder cancer and their caregivers. AURA passively monitors specific activities of a patient at home using WiFi signals, tailors natural language responses of voice assistants based on the patient's state, and automates entering data into the system to reduce the burden on the caregivers of cancer. AURA communicates with the care team in natural languages for reminders and confirmation of collected information, which is intuitive, handsfree, and less demanding. Building upon AURA, AURA-ALZ will have similar but enhanced features to address the unique care needs of persons with ADRD and caregivers. This study addresses the NLM’s mission of enabling biomedical research, supporting health care and public health, and promoting healthy behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the proposed study, we plan to adopt a user-centered approach to develop AURA-ALZ, an extended and adapted version of our innovative eHealth AURA program, to meet the needs of persons with ADRD and their caregivers. Different from previous interventions that focus on counseling, support groups, education, and skills training, AURA-ALZ will provide continuous monitoring of daily activities and gestures using a novel WiFi-based sensing technique, and enable voice-based user interactions, automated reminders, and hands-free surveys for guiding future individualized interventions for persons with early ADRD, which will help reduce caregiver burden, and ultimately, improve the health outcomes of the patients and caregivers.",AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers,10289180,R01LM013329,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Auras', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Patient', 'Car Phone', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Dependence', 'Devices', 'Economic Burden', 'Education', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Notification', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radio', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'care burden', 'caregiving', 'cognitive ability', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'dementia caregiving', 'eHealth', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional loss', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'learning classifier', 'member', 'multi-component intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'radio frequency', 'remote health care', 'research study', 'response', 'skills training', 'usability', 'web site']",NLM,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,75537
"Controlling Quality and Capturing Uncertainty in Advanced Diffusion Weighted MRI PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementia are a growing public health crisis affecting 5.8 million Americans, yet there are only four FDA-approved medications for Alzheimer’s Disease, none of which are disease-modifying. Hence, early detection and diagnosis are key to successful patient management and biomarkers are needed for evaluating new therapies in clinical trials. White matter changes are increasingly implicated in early Alzheimer’s Disease progression, and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) has been included in many national-scale studies. Yet, quantitative investigation of DW-MRI data is hindered by a lack of consistency due to variation in acquisition protocols, sites, and scanners. DW-MRI enables quantification of brain microstructure and facilitates structural connectivity mapping. Substantial recent progress has been made with calibration and harmonization to reduce inter-subject variance and improve interpretability of computed measures. Yet, the fundamental challenge remains that clinical application of DW-MRI (as currently implemented) is confounded by inter-scanner and inter-site effects. To improve understanding of structural changes in Alzheimer’s Disease, we will construct and evaluate three separate analysis strategies to characterize, calibrate, and optimize DW-MRI for single-subject biomarker development for Alzheimer’s Disease. We will integrate and optimize our strategies using large retrospective multi-site studies and validate the approaches on two distinct prospective cohorts. Specifically, we aim to: Aim 1: Optimize data-driven techniques for stability across sessions, scanners/sites, and field strengths Impact: Harmonized DW-MRI methods will increase sensitivity to Alzheimer’s Disease and its prodromal stages. Aim 2: Translate innovations in microstructural harmonization to structural connectivity (tractography) Impact: Harmonizing structural connectivity will improve understanding of white matter in Alzheimer’s Disease. Aim 3: Advance statistical tools for single-subject inference through normative database construction Impact: Data-driven resources for uncertainty estimation will enable robust single-single subject inference. Relevance and Impact on Healthcare: The proposed research will advance understanding of Alzheimer’s Disease through (1) quantitative harmonization of DW-MRI biomarkers, (2) protocols for harmonization of retrospective and prospective DW-MRI studies, and (3) new tools for single subject inference targeting older cohorts. We will organize workshops/challenges to maximize the translational impact on clinical science. The long-term goal of our research is to (1) provide a well-validated strategy to quantitatively evaluate DW-MRI data across sites, (2) enhance DW-MRI biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease, and (3) advance patient care. Our research strategy will transform the manner in which DW-MRI data are interpreted and enable single-subject machine learning to interpret brain properties. The resources, software, and visualization tools will be made freely available in open source through DIPY to facilitate continued innovation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s Disease is a significant public health concern, and identifying opportunities for early intervention is critical to developing effective interventional strategies. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW- MRI) has shown that subtle changes in cerebral white matter are prognostic for disease progression, but quantitative interpretation of these measures in existing large studies is confounded by protocol, scanner, and site effects. This study will translate recent advances in harmonization of DW-MRI to improve specificity of white matter microarchitecture metrics (aim 1), translate connectivity analyses (aim 2) for existing large Alzheimer’s Disease neuroimaging studies, and enable robust single subject inference for abnormality detection and prognosis (aim 3).",Controlling Quality and Capturing Uncertainty in Advanced Diffusion Weighted MRI,10316671,R01EB017230,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Normal Range', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Prognosis', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'aging brain', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'deep neural network', 'effective intervention', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'success', 'tool', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'virtual', 'virtual biopsy', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,665123
"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research. POJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The identification of novel therapeutics to prevent of cognitive decline, MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia is a major public health priority. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target with the potential to maintain cognition regardless of the type and number of brain pathologies. The proposed continuation of MAP will identify genes and compounds that affect a molecular signature of resilience in a novel human cell model of disease from autopsied MAP partic ipants .",Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging,10173577,R01AG017917,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-3', 'base', 'data hub', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'human model', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'sex', 'therapeutic target', 'trait']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,3008531
"Neuropathological changes underlying clinical heterogeneity in Alzheimer disease Project Summary This is an application for K24 award renewal for Dr. Lea T. Grinberg, a neuropathologist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Dr. Grinberg is an Associate Professor in Residence and co-lead the UCSF/Memory and Aging Center's Neuropathology Core. She is an established researcher in the patient- oriented clinical research of dementia. A distinctive hallmark of her research is her direct involvement in creating, managing, and analyzing well-characterized postmortem collections of brains belonging to people at-risk or already with dementia. Dr. Grinberg proposes to use K24 dedicated time to mentor USCF as well as international investigators in patient-oriented dementia research. Her mentees will gain hands-on research experience, expertise in age-related human neuropathology, training in data analysis, manuscript preparation, and grant writing, as well as career, mentoring. Mentee training will leverage the infrastructure and resources of the UCSF/Memory and Aging Center Autopsy program, which is part of ongoing longitudinal cohort studies, research portfolio, and her collaborations with multidisciplinary researchers in the areas of dementia domestically and worldwide. Dr. Grinberg intends to conduct K24-supported Alzheimer's disease research studies that will serve as training vehicles for mentees and expand her research. These studies, using clinical, genetic, and neuropathological data, will be conducted using data from ongoing UCSF/Memory and Aging Center's NIH- funded cohort studies of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). She will examine the factors underlying selective neuronal vulnerability in AD. In summary, this K24 will enhance Dr. Ginberg's active research program with extensive infrastructure at UCSF to support her goal to remain a leader in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in the field of neuropathology, and to develop a program of excellence for training medical students, trainees, and junior faculty in POR related to age-related neuropathology that is also intended to close the gaps caused by interruption of neuropathology training for neurologists and neurodegenerative disease training for neuropathologists. Project Narrative Closing critical gaps in the understanding of AD etiopathogenesis by clarifying the neurobiological basis of heterogeneity in AD clinical presentation may result in novel biomarkers and targets for the prevention and treatment of this devastating disease. This renewal K24 research and training program will expand the capacity of a productive investigator to train advanced trainees in POR in age-related neuropathology. Furthermore, it will help me to make meaningful progress towards her long-term goal of conquering neurodegenerative diseases by carefully mapping disease-associated lesions in well-characterized human postmortem tissue and correlate these findings with clinical, epidemiological and molecular features",Neuropathological changes underlying clinical heterogeneity in Alzheimer disease,10224551,K24AG053435,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Amnestic Disorder', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Human', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Interruption', 'Intrinsic factor', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Students', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologist', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regional Disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Senile Plaques', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcript', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'University resources', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'age related', 'association cortex', 'asymptomatic Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'base', 'behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'comorbidity', 'corticobasal syndrome', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'hands on research', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mid-career faculty', 'multidisciplinary', 'neocortical', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuropathology', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'residence', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2021,188296
"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades.

There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,10129873,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'experimental arm', 'experimental group', 'implementation facilitation', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app', 'web-based intervention']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,924106
"US-South American Initiative for Genetic-Neural-Behavioral Interactions in Human Neurodegenerative Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although dementia has a global impact, efforts to address ensuing challenges have come mostly from high- income countries (HICs). Whereas the prevalence and incidence of dementia appear to be stable or declining in such countries, an alarmingly opposite tendency typifies South American countries (SAC). This scenario proves even more challenging due to region-specific traits. First, the particular genetic and environmental backgrounds of SAC limit the generalizability of key findings from HICs. Moreover, the greater genetic diversity and impact of socioeconomic status (SES) of SAC remain markedly understudied. Of note, this is true of the four largest SAC (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru), representing over 75% of the region’s population. In addition, SAC face a dearth of innovative, harmonized, and cross-regional studies on two of their most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is thus critical for SAC to join ongoing international efforts and develop a gold-standard approach for detecting disease-specific alterations in a context of methodological, genetic, and socioeconomic heterogeneity. Against this background, our long-term goal is to identify the unique genetic and SES factors that drive AD and FTD presentation in SAC relative to the US. To this end, we will establish a cohort to test large samples from the four abovementioned SAC, as well as the US (totaling > 3000 participants, including 1500 controls, 750 AD patients, and 750 FTD patients). We will combine standardized clinical assessments with innovative analytical techniques including multimodal machine learning to account for heterogeneity in these diverse populations. By combining standardized genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (SES-cognitive) measures, we will test the underlying hypothesis that there are unique risk factors for AD and FTD in SAC which do not prove significant in US populations. More particularly, we will aim to (a) establish genetic risk to AD and FTD in diverse SAC cohorts; (b) test whether patients from SAC and the US can be discriminated after accounting for how SES affects cognitive and brain imaging signatures; and (c) determine genetic, cognitive, cerebral, and socioeconomic factors that discriminate among SAC vs. US patients. Positive impacts of this work include a better understanding of the genetic and socioeconomic factors driving neurocognitive manifestations of dementia, and the identification of novel genetic targets for risk reduction and disease prevention in SAC. Our large multimodal, cross-sectional study will enable clinical assessment of understudied patient groups, extend and harmonize existing data sets, and prompt the development of novel measures and multimodal machine learning protocols. More generally, by establishing a collaborative framework which capitalizes on unique regional populations, our proposal can consolidate a SAC-based platform for future translational research and assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although the prevalence and incidence of dementia appears to be stable or declining in high-income countries, South American countries (SAC) face the opposite scenario, with increased dementia prevalence, probably triggered by a combination of genetic and socioeconomic status (SES) factors. This proposal aims to create the first SAC-based multicenter initiative to study dementia, by combining genomic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (cognitive, clinical, socioeconomic) data. This project constitutes an unprecedented opportunity to foster regional synergy and multilevel research towards the harmonization of global strategies to fight dementia in SAC.",US-South American Initiative for Genetic-Neural-Behavioral Interactions in Human Neurodegenerative Research,10239263,R01AG057234,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Argentina', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Brain imaging', 'Brazil', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Colombia', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Education', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Status', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Indigenous', 'International', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South American', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'disorder prevention', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fighting', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'lipid metabolism', 'low socioeconomic status', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'polygenic risk score', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'synergism', 'trait']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,521480
"Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management Project Summary/Abstract Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation and our partners propose to develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) system for persons with dementia (PWD),(mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or other dementias), who are living in assisted living facilities. The proposed system uses Augmented Intelligence (AI) to communicate with the PWD in natural language. The system's goals are three-fold. First, the system helps PWD transition from living in their homes to ALFs by fostering relationships and conveying schedules. Second, the system enables PWD to age in place by addressing the challenges that often lead to an escalation of care (i.e., nursing homes). Third, the system engages PWD via activities such as storytelling and simple games. We will integrate the proposed SAR system with current assistive technology, which is based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and quality of life in PWD. A strong multi-disciplinary team of engineers, academic experts in SAR and PWD, and a commercialization partner has been assembled to achieve these goals. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases affecting an estimated 5.3 million Americans at a cost of $236 billion. Social assistive robots can be used to lessen levels of depression, loneliness, grief, fear, and frustration as dementia progresses improving mental health and quality of life. In addition to improved quality of life, persons with dementia may be able to extend the amount of time in assisted living before being forced to a much costlier higher level of care such as a nursing home.",Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management,10020889,R44AG058337,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Health', 'Hobbies', 'Home', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Loneliness', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'body language', 'cognitive computing', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'robot interface', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2021,1924651
"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Karen Schliep, a tenure-line Assistant Professor of Public Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors.",10248297,K01AG058781,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Eclampsia', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Database', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Environment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'administrative database', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'family genetics', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'high risk', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifetime risk', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality risk', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reproductive', 'reproductive system disorder', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2021,121999
"Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating effect on our elderly population living in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes. In particular, care for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) is extremely challenging due to their special needs and difficulty adhering to social distancing requirements. This administrative supplement under the Stanford Aging and Ethogeriatrics (SAGE) Research Center (P30 AG059307) will examine the emotional distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on dementia risk in racial minorities. Aim 1 will examine the extent to which COVID-19-imposed emotional distress mediates the association between childhood social distress and late-life increased risk of dementia by race. Aim 2 will examine the mental health and coping strategies of aging minority residents in nursing homes during the COVID- 19 pandemic by recruiting respondents in nursing homes in selected segregated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMAs). These results are expected to shed new light on the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating the effects of emotional distress on minorities living with dementia and how coping strategies may help to mitigate that risk and the provision of dementia care. Our results from both Aims will be integrated and complement each other by providing robust statistical evidence on the association between stress and ADRD as well as first-hand evidence and perspectives from residents and caregivers, who are currently at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Project Narrative: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely taking an enormous toll on the mental health of elderly minority patients and their caregivers in long-term care facilities. The results of this administrative supplement project will provide significant insights into the emotional impact of the pandemic on patients with Alzheimer’s and related dementias and ultimately lead to the design of more effective coping strategies for handling stressful events and improve the overall provision of care.",Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE),10268030,P30AG059307,"['Accounting', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Area', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 mortality', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Late Effects', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Race', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Social Distance', 'Stress', 'Stressful Event', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'aging population', 'comorbidity', 'coping', 'coronavirus disease', 'dementia care', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'emotional distress', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care disparity', 'health economics', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial discrimination', 'racial minority', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'residential segregation', 'segregation', 'social', 'social stressor']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P30,2021,197125
"Commercializing In-Home Supportive Technolgy for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, related dementias, or mild cognitive impairment is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including declines in mental and physical health, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects can compromise care quality for people with dementia (PWD). Empirically-supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms and pathways shown to connect troublesome behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers; (b) make low demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy; (c) can be personalized and adapted to the needs of different caregivers and PWDs as they change over time; and (d) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) application, we seek support for technical assistance and late stage research and development activities prior to the commercial launch of People Power Caregiver (PPCg). PPCg consists of a hardware system (sensors, monitoring devices, wearables), apps, and cloud services that combine Internet-of- Things (i.e., devices that communicate automatically over the internet) technologies with machine learning algorithms that run in the home and in the cloud to create a more supportive home environment for caregivers and people in their care. PPCg was developed with support from an SBIR Fast Track award to People Power Company and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (BPL) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology. BPL has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWDs and their caregivers for almost 20 years. CRP funding would enable us to commercialize PPCg successfully by supporting three specific aims: Aim 1: Increase PPCg accessibility. We will develop new versions of PPCg and conduct randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in underserved populations that evaluate effects on caregiver health, well-being, and user satisfaction in rural homes (Study 1) and Spanish language homes (Study 2). Aim 2: Increase PPCg support for wearable devices. We will evaluate PPCg with two wearable devices that monitor PWD movement and location, analyzing CareActive watch data (Study 3) as a way of improving alerting of worrisome events (e.g., wandering), and conducting an RCT with Apple watches (Study 4) to determine effects on caregiver health, well-being, and user satisfaction. Aim 3: Readying People Power for commercializing PPCg. To prepare People Power to commercialize PPCg successfully, we will: (a) add Spanish-speaking customer service staff; (b) increase intellectual property protection by filing 5 non-provisional PPCg patent applications; and (c) partner with companies that serve large numbers of older customers (e.g., telecom companies and utilities) and have deep senior care expertise (e.g., professional caregiver agencies) to market and distribute PPCg. Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Commercializing assistive technology that monitors worrisome behaviors, improves safety, and reduces social isolation in the home environment can improve the lives of caregivers and people with dementia worldwide.",Commercializing In-Home Supportive Technolgy for Dementia Caregivers,10259751,SB1AG059458,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anxiety', 'Apple watch', 'Applied Research', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Chinese People', 'Cloud Service', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health', 'Home', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intellectual Property', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Marketing', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Psychophysiology', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training Support', 'Trust', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'care giving burden', 'caregiving', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'effective therapy', 'emotional functioning', 'falls', 'improved', 'interest', 'loved ones', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'programs', 'psychoeducation', 'research and development', 'rural area', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills training', 'wearable device']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,SB1,2021,1567178
"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,10137860,K01AG059843,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Anxiety', 'Barbiturates', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cost Sharing', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family Physicians', 'Formularies', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part B', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universal Coverage', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,126700
"Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT The overarching goals of this R01 proposal are to improve scientific understanding of potential mechanisms by which ophthalmic diseases lead to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will leverage modern ophthalmic data with state-of-the-art imaging and extensive archived clinical data from a well-characterized cohort of older adults. The investigators propose to examine the effect of structural and functional changes in retina and longitudinal severity of ophthalmic diseases on Alzheimer’s disease and related neuropathology. The proposal builds on the resources of the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a prospective longitudinal, population-based, dementia-free cohort of over 5,500 people to date established in 1994 which has detected >1,014 research quality diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease and >1,254 dementia to date. ACT follows consenting participants to autopsy and has performed state-of-the arts autopsy on >781 decedents to date. In this extremely well-characterized cohort, the investigators found that several ophthalmic diseases (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration) are significantly associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will use three advanced ophthalmic imaging modalities at both home and clinical research study visits: fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography (OCTA), to obtain quantitative data relevant to these ophthalmic diseases. The study team will establish the distribution (Aim 1a) and 2- and 4-year evolution of ophthalmic imaging characteristics found in older adults in the community and determine associations with change in cognition (Aim 1 b, c). Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI angiography (MRA) will be obtained in a subset of participants to investigate the contribution of small (retinal) and large (cerebral) vascular disease towards cognitive changes (Aim 1d). The study team will continue ACT study’s strong commitment for meaningful data sharing. In collaboration with the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at University of Southern California, the study team will promulgate these ophthalmic data in addition to neuroimaging data to the research community (Aim 1e). In Aim 2, the investigators will use extensive clinical ophthalmology data captured over many decades and incorporate them in novel longitudinal models of eye disease severity. The investigators will analyze eye disease severity along with extensive neuropathology data from the ACT study, including both standard (Aim 2a) and novel quantitative (Aim 2b) neuropathology data, to further scientific understanding of neuropathological mechanisms underlying associations between eye conditions and Alzheimer’s disease risk. The brain is not amenable to direct observations during life. In contrast, the eye is an anterior extension of the central nervous system and may provide a valuable window to illuminate neurodegenerative processes in the aging brain. Proposed investigations will substantially enhance scientific understanding of the role of modern ophthalmic evaluations in delineating risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of neuropathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a large, well-characterized, longitudinal, prospective, cohort study, the study team previously found that diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration were significantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk. The team proposes to use three cutting edge ophthalmic imaging modalities to obtain quantitative data at both home and clinic research study visits in addition to MRI and MRA in a subset of participants to evaluate their associations with change in cognition over time (Aim 1). The team will leverage extensive ophthalmic clinical and neuropathological data already available for 781 study participants to date as well as new state-of-the-art quantitative measures of beta amyloid (Aβ1-42) and phosphorylated tau to elucidate mechanisms underlying associations between ophthalmic conditions and Alzheimer’s disease (Aim 2).",Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study,10237257,R01AG060942,"['Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Angiography', 'Anterior', 'Archives', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Home', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neuraxis', 'Occipital lobe', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Selection Bias', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis quality', 'epidemiology study', 'fiber cell', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'population based', 'prospective', 'public repository', 'research study', 'resilience', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'vascular contributions']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,3398294
"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use. The results will help in expanding access to and delivery of empirically supported behavioral health services for caregivers and people with dementia.",STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up,10200658,R01AG061926,"['Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'E-learning', 'Education', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Family Caregiver', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home', 'Home visitation', 'Improve Access', 'Information Management', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Acceptability', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Site', 'Social Workers', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Travel', 'Washington', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'arm', 'attentional control', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-site trial', 'outreach', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'program costs', 'programs', 'psychological symptom', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'response', 'retiree', 'secondary outcome', 'time use', 'urgent care', 'virtual', 'web portal', 'willingness']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,509815
"A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings This NIA Stage I study is designed to address two leading barriers to implementation of evidence-based dementia care and caregiver support programs into long-term care settings: (1) lack of streamlined, user-friendly, and tested training modalities, and (2) lack of scalable, practical processes to accurately measure fidelity in “real world” settings. The aims of the study are to determine whether an online training program is the same or better in improving interventionist fidelity to an evidence based dementia program (COPE) and dementia patient outcomes when compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form of training. To accomplish these aims we will develop an online, principle-driven approach using state-of-the- science simulation and best practices and a scalable approach to assess fidelity to COPE by applying computational linguistics techniques. We will then conduct a noninferiority trial in Programs for All Inclusive Care for Elders (PACE) organizations randomly assigned to the training conditions. PACE staff will be evaluated post training on their fidelity outcomes. Dyads of persons with dementia and their caregivers will be evaluated at 4 months post COPE implementation on function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver burden. The findings from this project will lay the essential groundwork for a large scale, Stage III-IV, pragmatic trial of COPE in PACE settings throughout the US. Findings will also serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs. Most persons with dementia and their caregivers do not have access to or receive beneficial and supportive evidence-based programs due to the need for scalable and reliable training and monitoring procedures for clinicians. We address this gap to developing and testing a replicable, accessible, and sustainable processes for training and monitoring clinicians in Care of Persons in the Environments (COPE) - an evidence based dementia care program - in a long-term care service setting. Study findings will yield an understanding of ways to move evidence into real-world dementia care settings and can serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs.",A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings,10186679,R01AG061945,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Day Care', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Home', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Registered nurse', 'Science', 'Service setting', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'comparative efficacy', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'pragmatic trial', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'uptake', 'user-friendly']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,509690
"Tele-CF: A practical platform for remote monitoring of cognitive frailty ABSTRACT Cognitive frailty (CF), the combined presence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment, is a strong and independent predictor of cognitive decline over time. The International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics and the International Academy on Nutrition and Aging have recommended the use of cognitive frailty assessment to track the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) towards dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and loss of independence. However, there is no practical tool for assessment of CF during telehealth visits. This is especially important as telehealth is growing in popularity amongst older adults and increasingly accepted by healthcare payers, and as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated these trends. Therefore, there is an unmet need for a software-based solution that enables remote assessment of CF during telehealth visit and can be integrated into existing telehealth systems. In Phase I, we successfully designed a prototype of a novel CF measurement tool, called Tele-CF, that uses deep learning-based image processing to remotely measure CF. The Tele-CF algorithms extracts kinematic features of the forearm motion from a video of 20-second elbow flexion and extension, and quantifies weakness, slowness, rigidity, and exhaustion (which are phenotypes of frailty) to generate a frailty index (FI). FI ranges from zero to one, with higher values indicating progressively greater severity of frailty. When applied under dual-task conditions (e.g., while simultaneously performing a working memory task), Tele-CF can also screen cognitive impairment. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility and proof of concept validity of Tele-CF for use in older adult population (n=29, age: 78.6±6.5), including 18 subjects with MCI or mild dementia, by comparing the results against validated tools (a sensor-based tool for in-clinic frailty assessment, dual-task gait, and a clinical cognitive scale, MMSE). After successfully achieving all milestones of Phase I, we are proposing to complete the development of Tele-CF and carry out a clinical study to demonstrate the ability of Tele-CF for remote tracking of CF over a 12-month period and to predict decline in CF at 12 months. To achieve the clinical aim of the study, we will recruit 100 adults (age 60+) with clinically confirmed MCI or mild dementia including 50 subjects without physical frailty and 50 subjects with physical frailty. All subjects will be assessed in clinic using conventional cognitive-motor assessment tools, at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, and also remotely starting from the baseline every two months using Tele-CF. Tele-CF provides an easy-to-use desktop application for remote assessment of CF for clinicians that works with existing telehealth platforms. Tele-CF desktop application will enable clinicians to identify, document, and track CF in older patients. In addition, Tele-CF will have broader applications in collection and analysis of video biomarkers in telehealth and clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive frailty (the combined presence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment) is a strong and independent predictor of cognitive decline over time. However, there is no practical tool for remote assessment of CF during telehealth visits.

"Diversity Supplement to Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark’s population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD and mortality later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis- generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation.

"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention,10171753,R01AG063887,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'black/white disparity', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcification', 'critical period', 'dementia risk', 'early life exposure', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'heart function', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'treatment strategy', 'trend', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2021,740671
"Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science The central goal of this proposed Roybal Center is to develop, test, and implement novel interventions that bridge the dramatic gap between the supply of and need for palliative care services among persons with dementia (PWD) living in long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, as well as their family caregivers. Several innovative aspects of this proposed Center position us to succeed in this challenging but increasingly important space. First, we have assembled a team comprising more 50 investigators and staff from 5 schools within the University of Pennsylvania, and the most accomplished investigators of palliative approaches to care for PWD from 11 peer institutions. These investigators possess content knowledge and tremendous expertise in leading all Stages of behavioral intervention development as defined by the NIH Stage Model. Second, we will support these behavioral scientists by linking them with Center faculty with expertise in several key methodologic areas including behavioral economics, data science, statistics, qualitative methods, health policy and economics, and implementation science. Our focus on translating behavioral economic insights to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers involved in the care of PWD builds on our recent success using similar approaches to improve palliative care delivery in outpatient and hospital settings. Our focus on using machine learning, natural language processing, and network methods will enable us to (a) identify mechanisms of clinician behavior that account for aggressive care for PWD, (b) identify PWD with the greatest unmet palliative care needs so as to sustainably target intervention delivery, and (c) more efficiently measure person-centered outcomes in the context of large, pragmatic trials of the most promising interventions. Third, this Center is being launched in partnership with Genesis HealthCare, the nation's largest owner of LTSS facilities, with 401 nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the U.S. These facilities provide ideal settings within which to develop and test interventions that will be effective and sustainable in the real world. Further, by developing and testing the interventions in these settings, while continually increasing our collaborations with other owners of LTSS facilities, we will be ideally positioned to implement effective interventions in the places in which the majority of Americans with dementia are cared for near the end of life. This Center will be directed by a Steering Committee, and will include a Management and Administrative Core housed within Penn's existing Palliative and Advanced Illness Research (PAIR) Center. A Pilot Core will select, guide, and monitor pilot projects chosen for funding each year. We propose two pilots for funding in the first year: a Stage I study that seeks to adapt a web-based advance care planning platform for use among PWD and their caregivers in LTSS settings, and a Stage 0 study that will use data science methods to identify clinician behaviors associated with hospitalization risk among PWD, yielding targets for future interventions. NARRATIVE Although most persons with dementia (PWD) die in nursing homes and other long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, few interventions have improved the processes or outcomes of care for such patients. This Roybal Center will unite junior and senior physician, nurse, and social scientists with expertise in Stages 0-V behavioral intervention studies, behavioral economics, and data science with a shared goal to develop, test, and implement interventions to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers for PWD in LTSS facilities. We will achieve this goal by partnering with the nation's leading researchers in palliative care for PWD and the largest owner of nursing homes, using its facilities as sites for the pilot studies we will support.",Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science,10251982,P30AG064105,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Advance Care Planning', 'American', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family Nursing', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Process', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'care systems', 'caregiver interventions', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'end of life', 'health economics', 'hospice environment', 'implementation efforts', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'palliative', 'peer', 'person centered', 'pragmatic trial', 'provider behavior', 'social', 'statistics', 'success', 'symptom management', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2021,753651
"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain. Successful completion of the proposed work will have broad immediate implications in refining participant selection in clinical trials, as well as long term implications in the advancement of translational research and targeted disease-specific therapeutic approaches.",In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging,10179293,R01AG064233,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'follow-up', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'in vivo', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'recruit', 'religious order study', 'response']",NIA,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,663226
"Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot randomized, controlled trial with outcomes assessment using digital phenotyping Over 15 million Americans serve as family caregivers of relatives with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD- Related Dementias (ADRD), and this often subjects them to tremendous stress, resulting in poorer mental health and higher risk of physical illness. Due to emotional and physical exhaustion, lack of time, and immediate needs related to caring for their loved ones, caregivers often forego their own self-care. The National Institute on Aging Strategic Plan identifies the need to develop better interventions to improve the mental and physical health of caregivers as a crucial priority area. The purpose of this Paul B. Beeson K76 Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging Research application is to support the research training of Dr. Felipe Jain, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Jain’s work aims to improve caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone with guided imagery and mindfulness therapies that reduce stress and help the caregiver improve mentalizing (understanding the links between mind and behavior) of themselves, their loved one suffering from dementia and others in their social milieu. Further, Dr. Jain hopes to develop the skills in machine learning and data science necessary to estimate early changes in caregiver symptoms remotely and passively, without any additional effort on the part of the caregiver who is often already overwhelmed, using smartphone sensors that capture information about caregiver behaviors.  In the conduct of this K76 award, Dr. Jain will lead a randomized, controlled trial for 120 AD/ADRD caregivers 60 years of age or older. Caregivers will be assigned to receive smartphone applications that either include a caregiver skills toolbox alone, or a caregiver skills toolbox combined with Mentalizing Imagery Therapy (MIT). MIT uses guided imagery and mindfulness to help caregivers improve stress, reduce negative mood and increase mentalizing. Theoretically, stress reduction resulting from MIT due both to mindfulness skills and better mentalizing of the care recipient and others should help caregivers better implement tools for caregiving within their unique social environment and accounting for the care recipient’s individual symptoms.  The first aim of the study is to determine the clinical effects of App-delivered caregiver skills with or without MIT on caregivers’ perceived stress, caregiver burden, mastery, depression and insomnia. The second aim is to develop behavioral markers from smartphone sensors that are associated with outcomes. We will (1) test the hypothesis that smartphone estimated sleep is longitudinally associated with caregivers’ self-reported insomnia, stress and burden and (2) determine the feasibility of identifying behavioral features with machine learning to predict day-to-day sleep and stress. If successful, this research will help open a new avenue of AD/ADRD caregiver research and treatment focused on improving mentalizing. It will also inform the field of aging research regarding the feasibility of using smartphone sensors to detect changes in early behavioral markers that may be used by clinicians to intervene for older adults at risk of poor outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research will promote the public health of more than 15 million Americans who serve as family caregivers for relatives with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. It will assess whether stress reduction therapy incorporating guided imagery practices that promote perspective taking and empathy can improve the effects of family caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone. It will also test the feasibility of using smartphone estimated markers to track caregiver insomnia and stress, which could eventually help reduce caregiver suffering and healthcare costs by identifying early warning signs of treatment failure and symptomatic worsening.","Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot randomized, controlled trial with outcomes assessment using digital phenotyping",10254289,K76AG064390,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic stress', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotional Stress', 'Empathy', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Friends', 'Guided imagery', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mindfulness Training', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self Care', 'Sleep', 'Sleeplessness', 'Social Environment', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'care giving burden', 'care recipients', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiving', 'clinical effect', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'exhaustion', 'feasibility testing', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'loved ones', 'medical schools', 'mental imagery', 'mindfulness', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'negative mood', 'novel therapeutics', 'perceived stress', 'physical conditioning', 'predict clinical outcome', 'primary caregiver', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychological symptom', 'remote delivery', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'skills', 'skills training', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'stress reduction', 'tool']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K76,2021,213157
"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. This project will develop Artificial Intelligence-based reminder systems to help ensure long-term engagement to home-based cognitive assessment and cognitive training protocols to be able to detect and treat cognitive impairment as soon as possible.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,10134189,R01AG064529,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Home', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Life Style', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Weight', 'aging population', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cognitive training', 'design', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile computing', 'next generation', 'person centered', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,654065
"Using gamification, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, and Alexa Voice to optimize user experience for individuals living with AD/ADRD and their caregivers More than 5.8 million Americans live with dementia and one in 10 Americans over the age of 65 suffer from a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s related dementias (AD/ADRD). There are no cures for AD and drug treatments have little overall impact on the course and symptoms of disease. There are no diagnostic tools that can reliably identify people in the early stages of the disease. Individuals living with AD/ADRD have the same quality of life needs as individuals without dementia, including the ability to successful complete routine activities of daily living and maintain satisfying levels of independence and autonomy. However, in the setting of progressively diminishing memory and worsening abilities for self-care, individuals living with AD/ADRD experience progressive losses in independent decision- making capacity and quality of life. Social isolation and anxiety are disabling consequences of this condition. The MapHabitTM system (MHS), is an award-winning (NIH/NIA 1st place Eureka Award) patented, neuroscience-based assistive technology app that helps the memory-impaired accomplish activities of daily living, maintain their independence, and improves overall quality of life for users. The MHS product leverages the science of visual mapping to cue appropriate behavior in the AD setting. In this SBIR Phase II application, MapHabit will further develop the utility and effectiveness of the MHS visual mapping technology to enhance its commercialization and marketing potential by increasing its “stickiness” (i.e., motivation to engage with the app) and to establish a more substantive evidence base for its effects on improved quality of life and daily functioning. We propose two specific aims: Aim 1 – MapHabit will optimize the user experience for individuals with AD/ADRD by supplementing its visual mapping software with gamification technology via a partnership with a virtual reality and in-app games company that serves healthcare needs. Social networking (via gaming with friends and other residents) will be developed to build social connectivity and increase competition, both of which are known to increase “stickiness” and keep users engaged and motivated to adhere to behavioral interventions such as ADLs. We will conduct a 6-month clinical trial to assess behavioral outcomes. Aim 2 – MapHabit will develop a predictive analytics framework using the biometric and behavioral data streams from individuals as they use visual maps to carry out their ADLs. Partnering with a healthcare artificial intelligence company, we will conduct an observational cohort study to collect and integrate 16 months of data streams from 15 dyads from multiple data sources, including gamification and social networking using the MHS, standardized neuropsychological assessments of the patients, and assessments from caregivers. These novel data will be used to explore new predictive models that will potentially indicate early warnings of oncoming cognitive decline. MapHabit’s proposal is focused on the development of science-based, innovative assistive technology for people living with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD). The technology objective is to help individuals maintain their independence and autonomy longer and reduce the burden of AD/ADRD caregiving by using visual mapping that cues behavior. These goals reflect the nation’s public health goals of reducing the burden of AD/ADRD on individuals, their families, and society at large.","Using gamification, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, and Alexa Voice to optimize user experience for individuals living with AD/ADRD and their caregivers",10325279,R44AG065081,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Motivation', 'Neostriatum', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Outpatients', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Science', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'dashboard', 'data streams', 'decision-making capacity', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health goals', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intrinsic motivation', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'patient home care', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'promoter', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality', 'vision science', 'visual map']",NIA,"MAPHABIT, INC.",R44,2021,1189927
"Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the future of healthcare availability and quality of services seems uncertain, at the same time advances in pervasive computing and intelligent embedded systems provides innovative strategies to meet these needs. One particular need which technology can help address is assessment and assistance with a person's functional performance. The long-term goal of this work is to develop technologies that will improve the independent functioning and quality of life of individuals with functional limitations (particularly individuals with ADRDs) and reduce their reliance on caregivers. The primary objective of this application is to develop a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and assistance with everyday activities. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach will be to collect and fuse multi-modal functional performance data from ambient sensors, mobile sensors, free text, and assessment apps (Aim 1). This fused “human behaviorome” will provide a basis, together with observation-based ground truth, for automated functional assessment and validation of each component technology, including the use of compensatory strategies, through in-person observation and through video recording of typical daily activities and strategies (Aim 2). Finally, using iterative, user-centered assessment of prompt-based assistance, we will evaluate the ability of activity segmentation and forecasting techniques to provide automated support for activity initiation and accurate completion of everyday activities (Aim 3). The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on functional health revealed within a person's everyday environment that have not been investigated in prior work. The results can also help to extend functional independence through real-time assistance, while the outcomes can assist family planning, provision of care, and design of real-world and lab-based measures of functional performance. This work is important because of the increasing number of older individuals experiencing cognitive and functional limitations due to chronic health conditions. Furthermore, they address the need for individuals to remain functionally independent as long as possible in their own homes, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and provide assistance with everyday activities for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings for functional health assessment and intervention. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline,10267717,R01AG065218,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Family Planning', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Home', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'health assessment', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,603938
"Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11% of older adults in the United States. Studies on patient transitions across healthcare settings suggests that older adults with chronic conditions are vulnerable to inadequate transfer of information, putting them at risk for diminished quality of care, medication errors and potentially preventable complications. Patients at varied stages along the ADRD trajectory – especially those with multiple chronic conditions – may experience unique risks due to the loss of information across care settings. In a recent study, we developed a longitudinal dataset on a diverse cohort of 56,652 patients – mostly aged 65+ with multiple comorbidities – receiving home health care (HHC) services from a large non-profit home care provider. For patients admitted to HHC in 2010-2012, we identified subgroups of patients with ADRD diagnoses made prior to and after HHC admission. Outside the scope of this prior study remains a vast and largely unexplored data source – nurses’ free-text clinical notes captured in the electronic health record. With roughly 1 million entries of nurses’ free- text notes associated with the study population, there is a wealth of potential information from which to gain new insights and a need for innovative methods to analyze this unstructured data source. In this study, we propose to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a method for systematically analyzing free-text content that draws upon machine learning. Using the dataset developed in the prior study, this study aims to: 1. Expand and improve an existing NLP system to automatically identify the following information in the  nursing free-text notes: (i) knowledge of the patient having a previously established ADRD diagnosis; (ii)  observations of cognitive symptoms and related patient/caregiver needs; and (iii) mentions of interventions  to address these needs. 2. For patients who do not have an ADRD diagnosis prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-  text documentation of cognitive symptoms identified in the NLP predict subsequent ADRD diagnoses  during the 4-year follow-up period. 3. Among patients diagnosed with ADRD prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-text  documentation patterns (e.g. knowledge of the patient’s ADRD diagnostic status, observations of cognitive  symptoms, and interventions) predict: (i) service use; and (ii) adverse health outcomes for which ADRD  patients are at heightened risk (e.g. hospitalizations due to urinary tract infection, dehydration, falls). This study will allow us to examine HHC nurses’ practices, which are often difficult to observe systematically, and identify strategies to address the complex needs of their patients with ADRD and un-diagnosed patients who may be on a path toward ADRD diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a home- based intervention that aims to improve quality of life for patients and caregivers along the ADRD trajectory. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5 million people in the U.S. Home health care nurses provide care for many people with ADRD and document what they observe about their patients’ needs in the form of free-text notes. This study will use a method known as ‘natural language processing’ to gain new knowledge from nurses’ notes and identify ways to better support people with ADRD and their caregivers.","Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study",10219952,R21AG065753,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Assessment tool', 'Awareness', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Nursing', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dehydration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home', 'Home Care Services', 'Home Health Care Agencies', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicare claim', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'New York', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Services', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Visiting Nurse', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'health care settings', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'patient home care', 'patient subsets', 'racial and ethnic', 'study population', 'unstructured data']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R21,2021,213501
"Guiding next steps for SPRINT-MIND implementation: Identifying high-benefit subgroups and comparative effects of ARB- vs. ACEI-based regimens PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are the leading cause of dependence and disability in the elderly population worldwide, costing the US healthcare system over $200 billion annually. Because ADRD represents a continuous irreversible physical and cognitive decline, identifying effective approaches for its prevention is imperative. Hypertension, particularly in midlife, is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and ADRD. Recent data from the randomized Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) Intervention Trial (SPRINT) Memory and cognition IN Decreased hypertension (SPRINT MIND) demonstrated that intensive SBP control (<120 mmHg) reduced the combined incidence of adjudicated mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable dementia, as well as abnormal white matter lesion (WML) volume compared to standard BP control (<140 mmHg) over five years follow up. To maximize public health impact, it is critical to identify which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and if cognitive benefits were due to direct effects of specific antihypertensive medications on cognition independent of, or in addition to, their BP-lowering effect. Prior animal and human studies, as well as our preliminary data, suggest that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) have greater effects on cognition than angiotensin-converting- enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). If verified, this finding would be significant since ARBs and ACEIs are currently among the medications most commonly prescribed to older adults and are thought to be equivalent in benefit and safety. Our objective is to answer remaining questions of how to safely implement SPRINT in older patients most likely to derive cognitive benefits from intensive SBP treatment. With its large sample size, 5 years follow-up, and high-quality repeated measures of rigorously adjudicated cognitive outcomes, brain imaging, and antihypertensive medication use, SPRINT MIND provides a unique, cost-efficient, and ideal setting to answer these questions. We aim to: (1) develop and validate a prediction tool that quantifies patients’ expected cognitive benefits and net (overall) benefit incorporating cognitive and cardiovascular benefit and risk of SAEs under intensive SBP treatment, and (2) determine comparative effects, including dose-response, of ARB- vs. ACEI-based antihypertensive medication regimens on cognitive and brain structure outcomes independent of SBP-lowering effects. Though SPRINT MIND is among the first randomized trials to demonstrate a beneficial preventive effect on cognition, it is uncertain how SPRINT-MIND should be implemented and in which patients. Successful completion of this project will guide next steps for implementation by determining: (1) which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and (2) if ARBs have greater beneficial effects on cognitive outcomes and WML volume than ACEIs, independent of their similar SBP lowering effects.

"Compensation Training and Lifestyle Modifications to promote healthy aging in persons at risk for Alzheimer's disease: a digital application supported intervention The prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease and other disorders (ADRDs) is now a public health crisis. In the absence of effective medical treatment, there is a critical need for behavioral interventions to prevent or delay symptom onset. Multidomain interventions simultaneously targeting multiple modifiable risks for ADRD have shown promise, but additional innovative approaches that could be highly accessible by capitalizing on user- friendly digital applications to support and strengthen behavior modification are needed. Training in the use of compensatory aids (e.g., calendars and note taking systems) can improve daily independence. These same compensatory tools can be employed to facilitate the adoption of lifestyle changes that support brain health (e.g., exercise, cognitive engagement, stress management) through management of goal-setting, behavioral monitoring, tracking and feedback. The current project will test a 6-month intervention that provides training in both compensatory aids and lifestyle modification. A comprehensive suite of digital tools encapsulated in the Digital Memory Notebook (DMN), an easy to use, interactive application, will be used to facilitate behavioral change and enhance participant motivation. Further, the DMN allows collection of real-time data to track intervention adherence. The DMN has been successfully applied to improving compensation among individuals with mild cognitive impairment. The proposed work capitalizes on a critical window for building resilience by targeting individuals at risk for ADRD due to a subjective cognitive concern (SCC) but who remain cognitively normal. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among ethnoracially diverse older adults with SCC to compare our digital app supported compensation training and lifestyle modification intervention to an education only control group that will not use the DMN or be provided with guidance on how to implement the educational material into their daily lives. Specific aims of the project include: 1) evaluate intervention efficacy on primary outcomes (global cognition and everyday function); secondary outcomes focus on well-being, cognitive domains (memory and executive function), activities of daily living (IADLs), physical function, compensation, and health behaviors; 2) evaluate characteristics of treatment responders; 3) evaluate adherence and identify the effective components of the target intervention using a mixed-method approach; and 4) design machine learning algorithms that use patterns of change in real-time DMN data metrics to identify incipient declines in treatment adherence and changes in health status. The intervention under study is novel because it applies training in compensation to support lifestyle modifications and everyday functioning using a digital app that also monitors adherence to each component of the intervention in real-time. The project is expected to expand understanding of factors that may impact adherence to and outcomes of a preventative intervention leading to optimization of a scalable intervention to reduce dementia risk applicable to diverse populations. There is an urgent need to develop interventions that will delay functional disability and improve the quality of life of our growing aging population. This work is expected to lead to a scalable compensation and lifestyle intervention to improve well-being and delay disability in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease and other disorders. This research is relevant to public health and NIH's mission as the results are expected to have an important positive impact on caregiver burden, health care costs and the functional independence of our aging population.",Compensation Training and Lifestyle Modifications to promote healthy aging in persons at risk for Alzheimer's disease: a digital application supported intervention,10119873,R01AG066748,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calendar', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Competence', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational Materials', 'Elderly', 'Encapsulated', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Financial compensation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Life Style Modification', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Self Determination', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain health', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'efficacy evaluation', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'functional independence', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'healthy aging', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'preventive intervention', 'primary outcome', 'racial and ethnic', 'resilience', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'stress management', 'success', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment responders', 'uptake', 'user-friendly']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,692048
"National Cohort Studies of Alzheimer's Disease, Related Dementias and Air Pollution Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, where currently 5.8 million people are living with AD dementias, and this number is projected to almost triple to 13.8 million by 2050. In addition AD and related dementias (AD/ADRD) healthcare costs for people ≥65 years were an estimated $277 billion in 2018. Although putative risk and protective factors have been identified, published studies have been unable to identify how to prevent and mitigate disease progression and who is most vulnerable mostly because the existing studies are based on small sample size and lack statistical power to disentangle the effects of different factors. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (a ubiquitous yet modifiable exposure dangerous to the aging brain) has been associated with decreased cognitive function, faster cognitive decline, dementia, AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Toxicological and human studies provide evidence of an association between air pollution and neurodegeneration, highlighting potential biological pathways that include systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. In response to PAR-17-054, our goal is to leverage massive nationwide datasets (Medicare and Medicaid), coupled with advanced statistical methods, to overcome the limitations of existing studies and clarify risk and protective factors for AD/ADRD. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will conduct national epidemiological studies using Medicare and Medicaid claims for the period 2000-2021 for the continental US, to estimate the association between exposure to air pollution and the time to the first AD/ADRD hospitalization. Among enrollees that have been hospitalized for AD/ADRD or MCI we will assess whether air pollution exposure increases risk of mortality, and/or accelerates re-hospitalization for AD/ADRD. In Aim 2 we will apply machine learning methods to identify co-occurrence of individual-level (previous hospitalizations, race, age, and sex), environmental (weather, green space, and noise), and SES risk (or protective) factors to determine which population subgroups are most/least at risk for AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression following air pollution exposure. In Aim 3 we will develop methods to overcome statistical challenges including (1) disentangle the effects of air pollution exposure from other confounding factors by leveraging approaches for causal inference, and (2) correct for potential outcome misclassification. We will conduct side-by-side epidemiological analyses using traditional methods (e.g. regression) and causal inference and machine learning approaches to understand which statistical challenges require more sophisticated approaches. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we will provide peer-reviewed open-source software so other investigators may implement our methods. In summary the results of this proposal will characterize the link between air pollution exposure and AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression, will identify the multiple modifiable risk and protective factors that determine vulnerability in AD/ADRD, and provide the foundation for implementable actions to prevent and reduce this enormous health burden. This project will leverage data on two cohorts (Medicaid and Medicare enrollees) to characterize the impact of air pollution on risk for and progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), and identify the complex interactions of individual-level, environmental and societal factors that lead to increased vulnerability in AD/ADRD. We will develop innovative, transparent, and reproducible methods to address current statistical challenges including outcome misclassification.

"A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life ABSTRACT  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are a group of progressive, terminal illnesses that will affect an estimated 14-million people in the United States by the year 2050. Caregivers experience chronic stress and they report feeling burdened and unprepared for making difficult end-of-life (EOL) care decisions, which may lead to unnecessary hospitalizations or avoidable transitions in care that affect end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL). Advance care planning (ACP), which improves EOL-QOL, is the gold-standard approach for improving concordance between preferences and actual care received at EOL. However, despite decades of research aimed at raising their rates, only 50% of those with AD/ADRD have a written ACP. Furthermore, there is a lack of current research evidence investigating the factors associated with transitions in care and EOL-QOL for persons with AD/ADRD, which could help guide EOL decision-making. To date, the state of the science is primarily cross-sectional in nature, and does not account for the influence of trajectories of decline, the effect these changes have on caregivers, nor how longitudinal changes in caregiving ultimately affect EOL care outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need to discover new approaches for preparing persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making informed, in-the-moment decisions, to ensure high EOL-QOL care and to support appropriate transitions in care as circumstances change over time. Using the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and National Study on Caregiving (NSOC), we plan to use a machine learning based framework to identify the key determinants for predicting the risk for EOL care transitions and the traits of EOL-QOL among older adults residing in the community. This study has two specific aims: 1) Develop predictive model of factors related to end-of-life care transitions (e.g. inpatient death versus hospice) in persons with AD/ADRD longitudinally; and 2) Develop a predictive model of factors related to end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) in persons with AD/ADRD. Discovering knowledge in a large population- level dataset is foundational for the future development of a generalizable/scalable model for guiding persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers as they navigate a fragmented healthcare system while making difficult decisions for their loved ones. Our approach fills a critical gap between the current approaches for improving EOL-QOL and EOL transitions in care that focus on ACP as a singular outcome, by addressing the comprehensive needs of individuals with AD/ADRD and their caregivers that change over time. Our study will provide a predictive model for EOL-QOL and EOL care transitions. This is a critical first step for the future development of an approach for personalizing care to guide persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making EOL care decisions. These results will have an important positive impact on EOL care, which aligns with the strategic goals of the National Institutes of Aging (NIA) and Nursing Research (NINR) to address clinical and translational gaps in the study of EOL care needs of people with AD/ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are at high risk for experiencing burdensome care transitions, avoidable hospitalizations, and poor end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) due to the increasing prevalence of multiple chronic illness and escalating demands placed on caregivers, resulting in significant personal and public socioeconomic burdens. Decades of research has focused on improving the rates of advance care plans above 50% among persons with AD/ADRD, however, others may benefit more from personalized guidance to help navigate the trajectory of decline that supports timely, “in the moment” medical decision making. This study addresses Goals 2 and 3 of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease to enhance care quality and efficiency and expand support for persons with AD/ADRD by identifying factors related to poor EOL-QOL and care transitions in the context of caregiving for the future development of a personalized approach to support in the moment healthcare decision-making.",A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life,10162470,R03AG067159,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospice Care', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Terminal Disease', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States', 'Update', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'inpatient service', 'loved ones', 'novel strategies', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'secondary analysis', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend']",NIA,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R03,2021,79750
"Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY  Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect over five million Americans. Alzheimer's disease begins with changes in the brain more than a decade before the disease can be diagnosed from memory and cognitive impairment in a clinic. The goal of this work is to provide a way to measure early signs of neurodegeneration in individual people. The historical barrier to measure change in individuals is that each person's brain is different with change accumulating too slowly to be picked over short intervals. As a result, most research focuses on tracking averaged subject groups or tracking change over multiple years. The present work optimizes new brain imaging techniques using MRI to make extremely fast, highly precise repeated measurements of brain regions all within the same individual. The work then seeks to use the novel imaging approach to measure neurodegeneration in individuals with early stages of Alzheimer's disease in six months or less and also differentiate changes in people with Alzheimer's disease from less common forms of dementia that have distinct anatomical changes in the brain. If successful, the present work will provide a new means to track the early stages of neurodegeneration as would be used in clinical trials and translational medical research. NARRATIVE  The proposed research explores the possibility of precisely estimating change in specific brain structures in individuals at early stages of neurodegeneration. Anchoring from recent developments in fast brain scanning techniques, we use a novel methodological approach that permits a tremendous increase in the precision of measuring change within a single person by repeatedly, safety, and efficiently scanning the brain over time. Demonstrating successful precision measurement within the individual will open opportunities to track therapeutic effects in small samples during early phases of development as well as allow for individualized estimates of neurodegeneration to be made dynamically within the same person. !",Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals,10140263,R01AG067420,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Procedures', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Unmarried person', 'Variant', 'Work', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive change', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'rate of change', 'safety testing', 'secondary analysis', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic development', 'time interval', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIA,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,598015
"Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses As the population continues to age and rates of late-life cognitive impairment rise, early detection of cognitive impairment is increasingly important for the timely implementation of interventions and safety initiatives. This may be particularly important in individuals found to have high brain amyloid burden, putting them at particular risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) of the brain. Performance changes in challenging, complex, high-stakes daily activities, such as driving, and accompanying physiological responses may together provide an inexpensive avenue for early detection. This may serve the dual purpose of alerting individuals or health care providers to early cognitive impairment, as well as to potential safety issues. Sophisticated in-car technology that is increasingly becoming standard in new vehicles may provide the means to unobtrusively capture sensitive information about naturalistic driving behaviors and potentially assist with early detection of cognitive impairment. The proposed study will apply a novel approach to unobtrusively monitor older drivers in (a) naturalistic, (b) fixed course, and (c) simulator driving situations. Machine learning approaches will be used to select key features of driving behaviors and physiological measures of arousal in all driving scenarios and eye tracking measures from fixed and simulator drives to predict drivers’ clinical diagnosis: young adult drivers, healthy older drivers with and without high amyloid burden, and drivers with mild cognitive impairment with evident amyloid burden. The participants will be followed longitudinally in the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) with annual cognitive and neurological evaluations, as well as repeat driving and physiological testing at two years from baseline. Understanding and identifying changes in driving behaviors and how these predict who will develop clinically identifiable cognitive impairment will lead to the development of a model for early detection of cognitive decline and ADRD. This study will examine everyday driving behaviors and physiological measures obtained by in-car monitors during common driving situations (e.g., intersections, freeway ramps). The goal is to build a model that uses features from these in-car measures to detect small driving changes that may be the earliest indicators of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. Utilizing data gathered unobtrusively from vehicles is cost effective, readily available, and may alert individuals and health care providers of early cognitive concerns, as well as potential safety issues.",Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses,10261410,R01AG068338,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Arousal', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Language Development', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Ramp', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Skin Temperature', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic platform', 'driving behavior', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'implementation intervention', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel strategies', 'older driver', 'programs', 'psychological aspect of aging', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'response', 'smart watch', 'social', 'visual tracking', 'young adult', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,1484783
"Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Project Summary/Abstract By 2060, approximately 14 million adults are expected to live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Although ADRD patients represent 10% of the general geriatric population, they account for 37% of the direct healthcare expenditures. Compared to other older adults, ADRD patients are at a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and unplanned 30-day hospital readmission (hereafter “readmission”). Readmissions are costly and expose ADRD patients to expedited cognitive decline, premature institutionalization, and death. Availability of a caregiver after hospital discharge is critical for ADRD patients to ensure adherence to diet, medications, and follow-up appointments. There is a paucity of evidence examining readmission among the ADRD population. Most risk-assessment tools (e.g. LACE Index) have poor discrimination power and lack inclusion of influential medical and social features, and caregiver availability particular to ADRD patients. A potential solution is to develop a risk tool using hospitals’ electronic health records (EHRs) because they contain salient clinical and sociodemographic features as well as a wealth of information from physicians’, nurses’ and social workers’ notes (unstructured EHRs data). The specific research aims for this proposal are to (1) develop and validate a risk-assessment tool for predicting readmission among ADRD patients; (2) examine the feasibility/acceptability and clinical/economic utility of the readmission risk- assessment tool; and (3) develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract information on caregiver availability from unstructured EHRs (exploratory). We hypothesize that the predictive power of our risk tool will be at least 20% higher than that of LACE Index (the current risk tool used in the Michigan Medicine hospitals). To accomplish this project, my mentors and I have defined a set of targeted career goals and educational training. My training aims include (1) gain familiarity with the clinical aspects of ADRD (linked with Research Aim 1); (2) acquire methodological skills in machine learning and predictive modeling (linked with Research Aim 1); (3) develop an understanding of the logistics of the ADRD patient discharge and care transition processes (linked with Research Aim 2); and (4) gain proficiency in NLP and algorithm validation (linked with Research Aim 3). By completion of this award, I will have used EHRs and data science to develop a validated risk-assessment tool for readmission for hospitalized ADRD patients. The results will enable efficient and targeted discharge planning to reduce readmission and wasteful spending. It will also provide pilot data needed to apply for an R01 examining the optimization of discharge process/location for hospitalized ADRD patients. This career development award will lay the foundation for me to become a unique health economist specialized in efficient care transitions for ADRD patients. Narrative Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) are at higher risk of hospitalization and 30-day readmission (readmission) compared to other older adults. Readmission is expensive and increases the risk of institutionalization and premature death among ADRD patients.

"Coupling and spread of molecular and functional pathology of Alzheimer's disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease resulting in loss of cognitive and bodily function, and no cure or effective treatment currently exists. While several pathological processes have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, including protein aggregation, inflammation, decreased blood flow, and metabolic defects, the exact mechanism of neuronal death and how the disease spreads from one region of the brain to another is unknown. The goal of this research project is to test whether molecular and cellular dysfunction can be transmitted from cell to cell along their pathways of communication in the brain. To achieve this goal, we will first map the functional connectivity between regions of brain in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, observe how these connections change over the progression of the disease, and link these functional changes to behavioral phenotypes in animals. We will then profile levels of inflammatory cytokines and metabolites in tissue from several brain regions in these same mice, and observe whether changes in immunometabolic state coincide in time and space with the functional connections measured by MRI. Successful completion of this work will test a potential mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease spreading through the brain, and provide a map of coupling between immune, metabolic, and functional pathology that could open new directions for future development of early disease diagnostics and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE While several pathological processes have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, including protein build-up, inflammation, decreased blood flow, and faulty metabolism, the exact mechanism of brain cell death and how the disease spreads from one region of the brain to another is unknown. We propose that the dysfunctional cellular state leading to brain cell death is transferred from cell to cell along their pathways of communication in the brain. To test this idea, we will map paths of brain activity using neuroimaging in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease, measure the corresponding levels of immune markers and metabolic function in each brain region, and then overlay these maps to understand how they correspond over the course of disease. This study combines cutting-edge neuroimaging and molecular assays along with machine learning and computational modeling to test a proposed mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease progression, with the potential to open new directions for pursuit of therapeutic strategies.",Coupling and spread of molecular and functional pathology of Alzheimer's disease,10217616,R21AG068532,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Control Animal', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Travel', 'Work', 'awake', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain cell', 'cytokine', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'imaging approach', 'interest', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuron loss', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'protein aggregation', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapeutically effective']",NIA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R21,2021,438028
"Leveraging Existing Data and Analytic Methods for Health Disparities Research Related to Aging and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) Abstract Two of a series of in-person workshops in 2020-2022 will be hosted at Duke to provide new knowledge on how existing and recently developed analytic methods can be used for detailed population and clinical data analysis in order to make progress in understanding the causes and mechanisms of health-related disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), related dementias (ADRD), and other prominent age-related diseases. The long- term goal of the series is to provide a resource focused on diffusing methodological know-how in terms of demonstrating the capabilities of newly developed methodologies, expanding on the rigor and range of application of well-established and familiar methods, promoting correct use of big health data both from a methodological and ethical prospective as well as providing a forum for experts and newcomers interested in health disparities and age-related diseases to discuss their ideas and promote their research. The pilot Duke- NIA workshop of the series held in February 2019 at Duke University was successful in drawing broad scientific interest to the topic and generated the background for the current proposal. The focus of the first workshop (planned in Winter 2020/2021) will be on demonstrating how studies using established administrative health data resources such as the Medicare claims database combined with innovative analytic approaches such as partitioning analyses, time-series based methods of projection/forecasting, and stochastic process models can be used to uncover previously overlooked and/or understudied aspects in this area of research. Specific topics to be discussed will include: i) disparities in risks and survival of AD/ADRD and other age- related diseases; ii) forecasting approaches for prevalence and mortality of AD/ADRD and other age-related diseases; iii) analysis of Medicare and other administrative claim-based data. The focus of the second workshop (planned in Winter 2021/2022) will extend this to include the health records data routinely collected in hospitals or University medical centers (e.g., the Duke Clinical Data Warehouse) and demonstrate how well- established and new analytic methods can be rigorously applied to such data to contribute to identifying the causes of persistent health disparities between specific groups of the U.S. population and narrowly defined patient strata. Specific topics will be expanded to include: i) analytic approaches to identify and quantify the contribution of treatment-related and medical care access-related factors to disparities in outcomes of AD/ADRD and other age-related diseases; ii) comorbidity, multimorbidity, treatment-related, social and genetic factors as sources of disparities in health outcomes of AD/ADRD and other age-related diseases; iii) forecasting of health outcomes and approaches for analyses of potential health interventions. The proceedings will be streamed live on the workshop website and presentations will be freely available in text and video form after the fact. Narrative Our objective is to host two in-person workshops in 2020-2021, in which research findings and evidence-based information and analytic tools for analyses of health-related disparities in Alzheimer’s disease, related dementias and other prominent age-related diseases are discussed. Specific Aims to be addressed in this project will be focused on increased collaboration and partnership in an interdisciplinary research community focused on analytic methods for large-scale population and clinic-related data, constructing a bridge between independent research subgroups, and the identification of ways to achieve synergistic effects in multidisciplinary research by combining innovative approaches developed across different research groups. Ultimately, our long-term goal is to diffuse the active use of advanced analytic methods for analyses of existing big health population datasets in health disparity research.",Leveraging Existing Data and Analytic Methods for Health Disparities Research Related to Aging and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD),10224101,R13AG069381,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Subgroup', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Universities', 'advanced analytics', 'age related', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical data warehouse', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'dementia risk', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'health record', 'innovation', 'interest', 'live stream', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'news', 'population health', 'prospective', 'social', 'web site']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R13,2021,50000
"Development of a reminiscence therapy online platform with machine learning to increase engagement with people living with dementia and their care partners PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or AD-related dementias, and the number of affected individuals is rapidly growing. Symptoms include impaired cognition, resulting in difficulty in performing daily activities and consequent functional dependence on others. The progressive nature of AD and ADRD can result in increasing degrees of care required from professional and family caregivers. Non- pharmacologic interventions positively influence cognition, mood, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and one well-established intervention, life story work (the use of written and oral life histories), serves as an effective technique that can elicit conversation and memories in those with AD and ADRD. However, generating useful life story materials is a time-consuming task for caregivers. To overcome this barrier, LifeBio Inc. is developing a reminiscence therapy platform —LifeBio MemoryTM— with a novel machine-learning-based application that converts speech to text and generates life stories to serve as an interactive tool to cultivate communication between people living with dementia and their family and caregivers. The LifeBio MemoryTM platform application will elicit and store individuals’ stories, photos, and videos and ultimately deliver personalized, point-of-care reminiscence therapy exercises for patients. In preliminary work supporting this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Inc. partnered with the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging to conduct a pilot study in nursing homes, which showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms among participants in LifeBio Inc.’s intervention and revealed that the majority of participants considered knowledge of their life story to be important for caregivers, while caregivers also reported positive experiences in relation to the impact of the intervention on caregiving. In this project we will: 1) Develop prototype enhancements of the existing LifeBio program and conduct focus group evaluations of these prototypes with 12 existing or former LifeBio users, 20 dementia care professionals familiar with LifeBio and 6 older adults with early-stage dementia to help maintain person-centered practices throughout the research process; 2) Finalize the LifeBio Memory product, which will include the development of a system to automatically record and process individuals’ life stories. 3) Conduct a full-scale fidelity trial of the complete package with 40 care professionals and 160 dementia care dyads across within an assisted living setting. The product of this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Memory™, will be a novel, scalable, and easily implemented solution through which caregivers and healthcare providers can offer person-centered care to people living with AD and AD-related dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Non-pharmacological interventions and person-centered care strategies are important elements of care for people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Life story work, which uses written and oral life histories to elicit conversation and memories, is an effective intervention for individuals with dementia; however, because of the time-consuming nature of generating useful life story materials, has not been widely implemented in nursing homes and other care environments.

"ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, 5.7 million people live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) in the United States, and this number is projected to reach 13.8 million by 2050. Two-thirds of individuals with ADRD live at home and as a result, approximately 15 million unpaid care partners, mostly family members, are increasingly required to perform complex tasks which causes them significant stress. The major contributors to care partners’ stress are: 1) having low confidence in their competency in their caregiving tasks, such as managing activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and behavioral symptoms of ADRD as they change over the course of the disease and 2) being socially isolated with feelings of loneliness. Benten proposes to address these problems through creation of the Avatar Companion to Improve the Lives of Informal care partners of individuals with Alzheimer’s (ACILIA), a home kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities (i.e., emotion analysis, sentiment analysis and life-long machine learning [L3] algorithm), with home speakers, a smart watch, and mobile app, to support the CPs on the care journey. ACILIA will provide just-in--time guidance and support to care partners in addition to stage- appropriate education and training on how to manage caregiving tasks. It will also engage in natural conversations with the care partners detecting sentiments of stress and offering advice and support and connection to a virtual community. ACILIA aims to assist in reducing the family care partners’ stress levels by improving their competency and capabilities in providing care and by providing companionship and support, which will reflect positively on their quality of life and that of their loved ones living with ADRD and aging in place. During this Phase I project, we will develop of a prototype ACILIA using input from an advisory board of informal care partners and people living with ADRD. We will also conduct a pilot test for feasibility of ACILIA among 20 individuals who are in early-middle stage ADRD and their informal care partners to evaluate the usability and acceptance of ACILIA prototype. Successful completion of Phase I will lead to Phase II and evaluating its outcomes. improving informal care partners’ competency, reducing their feeling of loneliness, and reducing their stress levels in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT). PROJECT NARRATIVE User-centered design and pilot testing conducted for the Phase 1 development of ACILIA will make it possible to evaluate the feasibility of ACILIA to support informal care partners of PLWAD in their care efforts.

Nearly half of people currently living with dementia have not received a diagnosis, delaying access to treatment as well as education and support for the patient and family. Thus, NIA has requested applications to support pragmatic clinical trials of low-cost tools to improve detection of cognitive decline in clinical settings (RFA-AG- 20-051). With pilot funding from NIA, we used machine learning to develop a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule), which uses easily accessible information in the electronic health record (EHR) to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. In addition, we interviewed patients, caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare system leaders to inform pragmatic implementation of eRADAR in clinical settings. Stakeholders felt strongly that such a tool should be implemented through primary care, in the context of existing clinical relationships, and would need to be accompanied by additional support for patients and clinicians. Our current proposal is heavily informed by this development work. In Aim 1, we will use EHR data to evaluate eRADAR's performance in different patient subgroups, including by race/ethnicity, in two healthcare systems to inform selection of cut- points for use in clinical settings. We will select an optimal cut-point to use for targeted dementia assessment with stakeholder input, balancing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. In Aim 2, we will perform a pragmatic clinical trial to determine whether implementing eRADAR as part of a supported outreach process to high-risk patients improves dementia detection. The setting will be primary care clinics within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA), an integrated healthcare delivery system in Washington State, and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), an urban, academic healthcare system with a diverse patient population. The study includes 6 clinics with ~24,000 patients age ≥65. Within each clinic, primary care providers (PCPs) will be randomly assigned to have their patients with high eRADAR scores targeted for outreach (intervention) or to usual care (control). Our clinical research staff—whose roles were designed to reflect existing roles within these healthcare systems to maximize pragmatism—will reach out to patients with high eRADAR scores, conduct an assessment for cognitive impairment, make follow-up recommendations to PCPs, and support patients after diagnosis. Patients with high eRADAR scores in both treatment arms will be followed to determine the impact of eRADAR on new diagnoses of dementia (primary outcome) as assessed from the EHR (again, to maximize pragmatism). In Aim 3, we will explore the impact of eRADAR implementation on secondary outcomes including healthcare utilization and experience of patients and family members. If this pragmatic trial is successful, the eRADAR tool and process could be spread to other healthcare systems, potentially improving detection of cognitive decline, patient care, and quality of life. Most patients with cognitive impairment are diagnosed relatively late in the disease process, and about half of people living with dementia are undiagnosed. We have developed a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule) that uses information in electronic health records to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. This study will determine whether a supported process of reaching out to patients with high eRADAR scores as part of primary care leads to earlier detection of dementia and improves patient care.","Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial.",10266125,R01AG069734,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Underweight', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'comparison intervention', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'outreach', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'preventive intervention', 'primary outcome', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'usual care arm']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,903251
"Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies). PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Every year Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051). Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low- cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS). The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare system with Epic nationwide. The high costs of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will consist of two complementary studies at diverse urban, suburban, and rural primary care practices within Central Indiana and South Florida. The first study Aim will evaluate the predictive performance of the Passive Digital Marker, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) using Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) data embedded within the Electronic Health Records, and the combined approach (Passive + QDRS) in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), compared to the gold standard of diagnoses. The second study Aim will evaluate the practical utility and effect of the Passive Digital Marker, the QDRS, and the combined methods in improving the annual rate of new documented ADRD diagnosis in primary care practices. The project will compare different approaches to early detection of ADRD, crucial to the endeavors to stop dementia progression; it will also evaluate the low-cost combined methods and integrated approach to overcome current barriers to ADRD detection.",Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies).,10266121,R01AG069765,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'American', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical dementia rating scale', 'Code', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'patient screening', 'response', 'rural area', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'suburb', 'tool', 'underserved area', 'validation studies']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,1048978
"Computerized assessment of linguistic indicators of lucidity in Alzheimer's Disease dementia Project Summary The focus of the parent project (AG069792) is to enable automated detection and analysis of episodes of unexpected lucidity in individuals with late-stage dementia in which the individual long thought to have succumbed to dementia and lost most of his or her cognitive abilities temporarily regains the ability to communicate in a clear and coherent fashion. Towards this goal, this project aims to develop a) technology for automatic conversion of speech produced by patients with dementia to text and b) measures of semantic coherence from the transcribed text. The development of this technology relies on state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods including deep learning and time series analysis. We are currently developing these approaches using existing datasets including the Carolina Conversations Corpus (CCC), Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) and Dementia Bank (DB) which contain audio and text transcripts of conversational interviews with patients with dementia of varying severity and healthy controls. Currently, the researchers in the AI/ML community use these resources by following individually developed pre-processing procedures that are partially described in publications resulting from their work and ad hoc code made available in multiple repositories. The results obtained by various investigators can be difficult to compare because of individual differences in how the data were processed and prepared for ML experimentation. For the one-year supplement project, we propose to create an open-source platform consisting of tools that will ingest original data available from DB, WLS, and CCC datasets and convert them to be AI/ML-ready in keeping with the current best practices in the AI/ML community. This project seeks to develop a validated tool approach to automatically monitoring people with advanced dementia who are thought to have lost their cognitive abilities for potential episodes in which they unexpectedly and temporarily regain their ability to communicate coherently. We propose to develop and evaluate a system to record the speech produced in advanced dementia, convert it to text and measure the degree of coherence of the language produced with the intention to identify atypically lucid episodes.",Computerized assessment of linguistic indicators of lucidity in Alzheimer's Disease dementia,10412501,R21AG069792,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'FAIR principles', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Ingestion', 'Intention', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Noise', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Transcript', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'advanced dementia', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'data interoperability', 'data modeling', 'data reuse', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'learning community', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'open source', 'open source tool', 'parent project', 'repaired', 'repository', 'research and development', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2021,228530

"Novel imaging genetic biomarkers for sporadic frontotemporal dementia through machine learning Project Summary This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Iris Broce-Diaz, a neuroimaging genetics postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Diego and University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Broce-Diaz is establishing herself as a young imaging geneticist conducting clinical research on neurodegenerative disease. This K01 will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) gain proficiency in machine learning and computational modeling techniques, (2) gain proficiency in clinical and genetic research methodology for cognitive aging and complex spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, including clinical characterization of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias, differential diagnosis, risk prediction, and biomarker development, and (3) develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Broce-Diaz has assembled an expert mentoring team, including her primary mentors: Dr Anders Dale (renowned computational neuroimaging genetics scientist) and co-primary mentor Bruce Miller (internationally recognized behavioral neurologist and leader in FTD), co-mentors: Drs. Jennifer Yokoyama (expert in FTD genetics) and Chun Chieh Fan (expert in epidemiology/biostatistics), and two collaborators: Drs. Adam Boxer (leader in clinical trials for FTD-spectrum disorders) and Wesley Thompson (expert in advanced statistics). The goal of the proposed project is to develop novel imaging genetics biomarkers for predicting individuals at risk of developing sporadic (non-familial) FTD and improving classification accuracy of sporadic FTD. Dr. Broce- Diaz will achieve this goal through the following specific aims: (1a) utilize a polygenic hazard approach to develop and validate a novel genetic biomarker for predicting age-specific risk of sporadic FTD; (1b) leverage pleiotropic information to increase accuracy of the genetic risk scores and derive biologically-based genetic risk scores; (2) use machine learning approaches to reliably and accurately classify FTD clinical subtypes and obtain personalized atrophy scores from these brain maps; and (3) improve FTD classification by integrating atrophy scores with genetic risk scores. This proposed study uses highly innovative methodological approaches for informing FTD prognosis, diagnosis, and, ultimately, clinical trial design. If validated, these biomarkers will make significant contributions by assisting clinicians in identifying patients at elevated risk for sporadic FTD and assisting in diagnosing sporadic FTD in its earliest stages—reducing diagnostic delays, accelerating the discovery of novel treatments, and improving recruitment accuracy in clinical trials. This K01 research project will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the protected research time and opportunity to train with leaders in the field she needs to master the skills required to establish an independent, patient-oriented, imaging genetics and biomarker development clinical research program that will inform diagnosis, prognosis, and guide treatments of FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Narrative The development and validation of predictive models is a critical step toward improving strategies for an early diagnosis of sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other neurodegenerative diseases and improving strategies for personalized treatment. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel imaging genetic biomarkers that can help clinicians with an early and accurate diagnosis and prognosis of sporadic FTD.

"Machine learning to predict incident MCI using standard clinical measures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While important progress has been achieved in our understanding of the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics, as well as genomic and neurobiological substrates of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, identifying individuals at a preclinical stage remains a vital priority and substantial challenge. The early and accurate identification of at-risk individuals becomes particularly important as we embark on next- generation randomized clinical trials to prevent or delay the onset of AD. The NIA recently convened a workshop involving experts from academia, nonprofit organizations, and industry with the goal to consider cost- effective strategies to improve the early detection of cognitive decline. A key recommendation by workshop participants emphasized opportunities to leverage existing longitudinal studies and apply machine learning techniques as a cost-effective approach to detect early cognitive decline. The current proposal represents a targeted step toward achieving those recommendations by leveraging a large and ongoing longitudinal study of APOE genotype and cognition (led by Dr. Richard Caselli at Mayo Clinic Arizona), and applies machine learning to identify individuals at risk for incident MCI at the earliest possible detectable stage. Machine-learning (ML) techniques implement predictive algorithms to find optimal mathematical and computational solutions to a set of complex problems. In dementia research, ML and pattern detection algorithms have been applied mainly to neuroimaging data, or neuroimaging data combined with clinical and genetic data, to distinguish prevalent MCI or AD cases from healthy controls. However, it remains to be determined whether ML algorithms can be marshalled as a key strategic and predictive approach to identify cognitively normal individuals at the earliest detectable stage of incipient decline. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposal aims to: (1) Investigate whether subtle variations among standard clinical and cognitive measures at baseline are associated with subsequent decline and incident MCI. Methods to achieve this aim consist of an ensemble ML approach, anchored by a random forests learning algorithm, applied to baseline demographic, clinical, and cognitive data as well as APOE genotype in a cohort of 784 adults. (2) Develop a probabilistic algorithm that predicts out-of-sample incident MCI cases. This aim will be accomplished by selecting 80% of the longitudinal data as an in-sample subset and using a dynamic Bayesian network approach to model the probabilistic trajectories of diagnosis at each study visit. With this Bayesian model, it will be possible to develop an algorithm to estimate each person’s unique risk of future MCI diagnosis. (3) Validate the predictive diagnostic algorithm using the remaining 20% of longitudinal data (out-of- sample subset), plus data from additional accruals during the intervening period. Successful completion of this project will be relevant to public health by helping to improve the prediction of dementia at a very early stage using standard clinical measures, and potentially aid in the implementation of therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE As our scientific field embarks on next-generation preclinical trials to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, it become critically important to identify accurately who amongst cognitively healthy adults is at an increased risk of cognitive decline and development of dementia. Consistent with the recommendations from the NIA to find cost-effective solutions that capitalize on existing data and apply new methods from artificial intelligence, the current proposal aims to apply machine learning techniques to identify, at the earliest possible detectable stage, those individuals who are at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Successful completion of this project will be relevant to public health as it may help to improve the prediction of dementia at a very early stage using standard clinical measures, and potentially aid in the implementation of therapeutic interventions.",Machine learning to predict incident MCI using standard clinical measures,10108473,R03AG070486,"['21 year old', 'Academia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arizona', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data de-identification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'middle age', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical trial', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'response']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R03,2021,157708
"Using Genetic and Blood Metabolites to Understand the Risk of Alzheimer's Disease in Latinos U.S. Latinos are highly diverse, with individuals originating from central and south America, as well as the Caribbean. Latinos are socioeconomically disadvantaged compared to U.S. Whites, and suffer from a higher prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia. Genetic determinants of Alzheimer’s disease may be somewhat different in Latinos compared to Whites: in preliminary results, we found that genetic background, in the form of proportion of genome inherited from Amerindian (Native American) ancestors mitigates the detrimental effect of the APOE-𝜖𝜖4 variants on cognitive decline in individuals from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). This suggests heterogeneity in genetically-based mechanisms underlying neurocognitive decline in Latinos. Untargeted metabolomics is a promising approach to develop potential biomarkers for human disease. Previous metabolomics studies identified potential biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease and for cognitive traits in a cross- sectional manner, however, very little work was done specifically in Latinos, and the genetics and metabolomics have not been integrated for risk prediction, apart from using APOE-𝜖𝜖4. Here, we propose to utilize a dataset including ~1,500 older Latino adults from the HCHS/SOL with untargeted metabolomics measured at a baseline visit, and neurocognitive function estimated in both the baseline and a follow-up visit. Our goals are: (1) develop preliminary biomarkers for aging-related cognitive decline phenotypes (e.g. change in global cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment); (2) study the genetic basis of the association of metabolites with cognitive decline, and study potential heterogeneity by genetic background; and (3) form recommendations and a grant application to support a larger research program utilizing genetics and metabolomics, and potentially other ‘omics, to develop biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease in diverse populations, and study underlying mechanisms. We will leverage an existing data set of diverse, well phenotyped, Latinos from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, to study the association of circulating blood metabolites with cognitive decline. We will develop and study prediction models based of blood metabolites, and assess the role of genetics and genetic ancestry on both blood metabolites and their association with cognitive decline.

"Super-Resolution Tau PET Imaging for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (the presymptomatic phase of Alzheimer’s disease) is characterized by pathophysiological changes without measurable cognitive decline and begins decades before the onset of cognitive symptoms. Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease research is in pressing need of new biomarker endpoints to enable disease monitoring before traditional cognitive endpoints are measurable. The overarching research objectives of this R03 Small Project Grant are to develop a super-resolution (SR) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging framework for tau (a pathophysiological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease) and to assess the clinical utility of localized outcome measures obtained from SR PET images. Studies show that tau pathology in the medial temporal lobe is an important marker of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease. Cohorts focused on preclinical Alzheimer’s now incorporate serialized 18F-flortaucipir PET scans for longitudinal tracking of tau accumulation in key anatomical regions-of-interest (ROIs). The quantitative accuracy of tau PET, however, is degraded by the limited spatial resolution capabilities of PET, which lead to inter-ROI spillover and partial volume effects. The problem is further compounded in studies spanning several decades, many of which were commenced on legacy scanners with even lower resolution capabilities than the current state of the art. Additionally, many longitudinal studies began on older scanners and later transitioned to newer models posing a multi-scanner data harmonization challenge. The proposed SR framework will perform a mapping from a low- resolution scanner’s image domain to a high-resolution scanner’s image domain and enable PET resolution recovery and data harmonization. Underlying the proposed framework is a neural network model that can be adversarially trained in self-supervised mode without requiring paired input/output image samples for training. This critical feature ensures practical clinical utility of the method as the need for paired low-resolution and high- resolution datasets from the same subject with similar tracer dose and scan settings is a major barrier for the clinical translatability of simpler supervised alternatives for SR. The proposed network, although trained using unpaired clinical data, receives guidance from an ancillary neural network separately pretrained using paired simulation datasets. For this purpose, we will synthesize paired low- and high-resolution images from a series of digital tau phantoms that will be created for this project. Training and validation of the self-supervised SR framework will be performed via secondary use of de-identified 18F-flortaucipir PET scans from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a longitudinal cohort focused on preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. We will evaluate SR performance using a variety of image quality metrics. To assess the clinical utility of localized super-resolution measures, we will perform cross-sectional statistical power analyses that estimate sample sizes per arm needed to power clinical trials. Accurate localized measures of tau generated by this project could enable early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and facilitate ongoing clinical trials by reducing sample sizes required for a given effect size. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this R03 Small Project Grant is to develop methods for generating high-resolution images of abnormal tau protein tangles, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. This will be achieved by building a self-supervised super-resolution framework based on a deep neural network for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tau.

"Identifying Digital Phenotypes of Risk for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Among Hispanics/Latinos PROJECT SUMMARY Hispanics/Latinos are at increased risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) compared to non-Hispanic Whites. While factors underlying this disparity are not well understood, increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among Hispanics/Latinos is likely to be a contributory factor. Pathological changes of ADRD begin years before clinical symptoms become evident and interventions are most likely to confer benefit in the earliest stages of ADRD. There is a pressing need to develop tools to detect the earliest manifestations of ADRD, particularly in Hispanics, who develop symptoms of ADRD at earlier ages, yet are diagnosed at more advanced disease stages than other groups. A variety of behaviors show changes in the preclinical stages of ADRD, including sleep, gait speed, and physical activity, among others. Recent innovations in mobile technology now offer novel ways to collect, track, and analyze these behaviors passively and unobtrusively, as a person engages in their daily life. Our preliminary work demonstrated that the application of machine learning models to passively-collected digital health data from smartphones and wearables differentiated persons with and without mild cognitive impairment with 85% accuracy in a primarily non-Hispanic White sample. Guided by the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework, we propose to leverage artificial intelligence (AI)-powered analytics and insights, coupled with readily available sensors in consumer electronics (smartphones, wrist-worn wearables), to identify digital biomarkers of ADRD risk, with a focus on vascular contributions to dementia, among Hispanics/Latinos. Augmenting an existing cohort study of Hispanics/Latinos residing in Southern California, the proposed study has three principal aims: Aim 1 involves determining digital signatures of ADRD risk among Hispanics (N=300; aged 50-70 years) using integrated passive mobile sensing features, derived from smartphones and wrist-worn wearables, and machine learning methods. ADRD risk will be defined by cognitive status and CVD risk burden (diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, smoking) and will also incorporate apolipoprotein E (APOE-ε4) and plasma-based AD biomarkers for further classification of ADRD risk. Aim 2 investigates sex differences in digital signatures of ADRD risk and Aim 3 examines the impact of sociocultural factors (e.g., language use, acculturation) on these signatures. We will also investigate whether changes in digital data features predict longitudinal neurocognitive change over a span of three years in a subset of Hispanics with and without ADRD risk. Housed within a renowned research institution at the vanguard of ADRD research and engineering innovations, the proposed study includes a multidisciplinary team with expertise across all aspects of this cutting-edge proposal. Recognizing the value of a community- engaged research approach, we have partnered with community stakeholders to ensure the relevance of our study to the Hispanic community. Our work could revolutionize early detection of ADRD and reduce ADRD disparities by developing a low burden, low-cost approach to identify ADRD risk among Hispanics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is paramount for prevention and treatment efforts, particularly in groups at increased risk for ADRD such as Hispanics/Latinos living in the United States. Consumer-grade mobile technologies present rich sources of data that can be collected passively in real world environments and can overcome the hurdles typically associated with traditional methods for identifying ADRD early. The proposed project will capture and analyze various streams of digital health data, passively-collected via smartphones and wrist-worn wearables, in order to identify digital signatures of ADRD risk in Hispanics/Latinos and reduce health disparities in this vulnerable and understudied segment of the U.S. population.",Identifying Digital Phenotypes of Risk for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Among Hispanics/Latinos,10298104,R01AG070956,"['Acculturation', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'California', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Funding', 'Gait speed', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sex Differences', 'Sleep', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'advanced disease', 'aged', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'community engaged research', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'digital', 'digital health', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'innovation', 'insight', 'literacy', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'multiple data sources', 'neurofilament', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'secondary analysis', 'sensor', 'sex', 'social culture', 'tau-1', 'tool']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,805050
"The BRAIN App: Building Relationships using Artificial Intelligence and Nostalgia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are currently 5.8 million Americans living with dementia and, without significant breakthroughs, this figure will double to 11.6 million by 2040 (Gaugler, et al., 2019). Dementia interferes with a person’s ability to function by impairing memory, reasoning, judgment, language, initiation, and socialization, leading to many unfortunate outcomes, including social isolation / withdrawal (Semple, et al., 1982; Alexander & Geschwind, 1984; Liu, Gauthier, & Gauthier, 1991, Social Care Institute, 2019). Dementia is also associated with a variety of responsive behaviors, such as wandering, repetitive questioning, anxiety, agitation, aggression, and apathy (Cummings, 1997; Hay, et al., 2003; Lazarus, et al., 1987) . Responsive behaviors and dysfunction of the dementia care triad—i.e., the person with dementia (PWD), professional Care Partner (CP), and Family Member (FM)—are inexorably linked. Emergence of responsive behaviors can lead to disruption of the triad’s function. Conversely, poorly functioning triads can lead to responsive behaviors. Thus, it is imperative to maintain positive relationships and a high quality of life (QoL) within the triad to reduce responsive behaviors. One approach that has demonstrated improvements in QoL and relationships is Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST). While clinical trials on CST have shown improvement of cognition and QoL, the potential large-scale impact of CST has been hampered by low adherence, with less than 40% completing trials (Rai, et al, 2018). One likely reason for the low adherence to CST is the reliance on generic and/or non-digital tools (e.g., DVDs, board games, etc.) in facilitating the intervention. With this in mind, the proposed Phase 1 study will involve the creation and testing of an Alpha version of an app called “Building Relationships using Artificial Intelligence and Nostalgia” or BRAIN. The BRAIN App will be the first -ever artificial intelligence infused CST app for PWD. The app has two main goals: (1) to foster positive relationships between the care triad, and (2) to promote QoL while reducing responsive behaviors in PWD. The market-ready version of the app will consist of six main components, each of which will serve a different purpose and be intended for different users. The proposed project has the following Specific Aims: (1). Create an Alpha version of the app, which will include the six main components (Life Story Profiler, Team Leader Dashboard, CP Dashboard, Resident View, CP Training Dashboard, Admin Dashboard), plus one component that will be needed only for Phase 1 (Playlist Matching Dashboard); (2) Examine the app’s impact on engagement/affect for both PWD and professional Care Partners (CPs); (3) Examine satisfaction and ease of use of the app for both PWD and professional CPs. (4) Examine the impact of the app on the nature of the relationship between the PWD and CPs. This Phase 1 project will lay the groundwork for a Phase 2 project in which: (1) an improved app would be created, based upon lessons learned in Phase 1; (2) AI will be used to recommend activities for PWD; (3) additional content will be curated and created; (4) a crossover trial with a large sample will be conducted; (5) we will examine the effects of implementing the intervention over a longer period of time; and (6) we will examine the impact of the app on responsive behaviors and QoL (for PWD) and burden and stress (for CPs). PROJECT NARRATIVE An estimated 5.8 million Americans are currently suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (AD); besides affecting the person with the condition, AD also presents a public health concern, due to the significant cost required to care for persons with dementia (PWD) and to the mental and physical stress placed upon caregivers.

"Auracle: An AI-Enabled Telecare System to Support the Independence and Safety of Individuals with AD/ADRD and Other Dementias ABSTRACT Dementia rates are growing at an alarming rate in all regions of the world and are related to population aging. It is estimated that over 30 million people have dementia, with 4.6 million new cases of dementia every year - one new case every 7 seconds. The number of people affected will double every 20 years to 81.1 million by 2040. Most people with dementia live in developing countries (60% in 2001, rising to 71% by 2040). The prevalence of dementia rapidly increases from about 2-3% among those aged 70–75 years to 20–25% among those aged 85 years or more. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia among western countries, corresponding to about 60% of cases while vascular dementia (VaD) is the second, with about 20% of all cases. Around 10% of adults over 65 develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI, while less severe than other forms of dementia, does impact everyday living and is a precursor of Alzheimer's. Dementia caregiving, perhaps more than any other type, places tremendous burdens on the physical, psychological, social, and financial wellbeing of the 4 million people providing informal care to seniors with dementia. Family caregiving, accompanied by emotional strain, was an independent risk factor for mortality among older adults. The majority of family care for older adults with dementia is carried out by either wives or daughters. Home caregiving may have negative acute effects on both psychosocial and physiological responses, especially in daughters. As functional impairment increases, during the course of AD/ADRD, caregivers require more assistance and access to resources to properly manage symptoms and, thereby, avoid an elder’s institutionalization. Greater support can also reduce the detrimental impact of stress on the caregiver. Technology that can support caregivers in monitoring the activity, safety and wellbeing of seniors with dementia in the homecare setting can significantly increase the quality of life for seniors and their family members as well as reduce costs to them and the healthcare delivery system. Unfortunately, current, outdated systems are of limited utility. We propose a technically advanced, but easy to use, low cost telecare system called Auracle. Auracle will utilize a unique combination of AI algorithms that will analyze data collected from a mesh network of innovative IoT modules placed throughout the home of the elder being monitored. This highly autonomous system combines a plug and play, compact form-factor with a voice interface. Auracle will be designed to improve the safety, quality of life and wellbeing of people with AD/ADRD or other dementias of aging and provide badly needed support to caregivers who provide their care. NARRATIVE Dementia rates are growing at an alarming rate in all regions of the world and are related to population aging. Alzheimer’s disease (AD/ADRD) is the most common type of dementia. Delivering care to the AD/ADRD population places enormous psychological, physiological and financial burdens on caregivers who are disproportionately women. We propose a practical, modular, telecare system called Auracle that uses innovative AI methods and IoT hardware and software technologies to support caregivers in providing improved safety, quality of life and well-being for people with AD/ADRD or other dementias of aging.",Auracle: An AI-Enabled Telecare System to Support the Independence and Safety of Individuals with AD/ADRD and Other Dementias,10258266,R44AG071211,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communication', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Daughter', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Financial Hardship', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home', 'Housing', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institutionalization', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Vendor', 'Voice', 'Wife', 'Woman', 'aged', 'aging population', 'care recipients', 'caregiving', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'family caregiving', 'functional disability', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'informal care', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'meter', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sensor', 'social', 'symptom management', 'telecare', 'web portal']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2021,445911
"Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family Caregivers ABSTRACT Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (PwADRD). Fall costs are expected to reach $67.7 billion this year and add to family caregiver (CG) burden. Injurious falls are a frequent reason people are unable to remain at home, resulting in significantly increased care costs to the family and society.  Most FP efforts fail to address understanding fall risks or changing behavior. In response to NIA requests for ‘Care technology to sustain in-home living, preserve function and promote effective communication’, an innovative falls prevention intervention for use by CGs of PwADRD living at home who are classified as at moderate to high fall risk for falls will be developed and tested. Goal: Develop FallScape for Dementia (FS-D), an innovative CG-provided daily treatment utilizing proprietary multimedia and behavioral intervention methods to facilitate communication and encourage FP behaviors that will reduce PwADRD falls.  The rigorous Phase 1 research plan will: a) develop a FS-D prototype that includes CG training software, multimedia and support tools to customize, conduct and review progress in daily CG-provided Mm sessions; b) Perform pilot testing and c) conduct a mixed methods preliminary clinical trial. Specific Aims and milestones/deliverables are: a) Develop prototype; i. Produce multimedia assets; ii. Craft Customization; iii. Artificial Intelligence algorithms; iv. Create CG training/daily administration tools. b) Pilot test prototype. i. Recruit 12 Dyads representing PwD diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, vascular, Lewy- body and Parkinson’s disease dementias. ii. Test CG ease of use and acceptability; iii. Examine customization for CG and dementia sub-types; iv. Evaluate relevance and dyad engagement. c) Conduct Preliminary Clinical Trial. 1. Recruit and enroll 25 Dyads; 2. Provide study components: initial; one-month FS-D intervention and a Follow-up; 3. Follow Dyads for 6 months; 4. Analyze outcomes and disseminate results.  FS-D will offer a rare opportunity to empower both CG and PwADRD by breaking the frustrating cycle of failure to recognize fall threats or change behavior and may mitigate CG burden. FS-D is an urgently needed falls prevention intervention for family CG use. The economic and quality of life benefits of sustaining in-home living for PwADRD by preventing falls will accrue to all stakeholders for this large, high-risk population. Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related Dementias (PwADRD) and the family caregiver (CG) is uniquely positioned to provide a positive daily interaction with the PwADRD in order to improve recognition of personal fall risks, encourage falls prevention behaviors and reduce falls. The proposed product FallScape- Dementia will develop and test a system for daily CG use in which Artificial Intelligence algorithms will guide the CG and customize the daily sessions. Reduction of falls will help the PwADRD to remain at home, reducing family and public health costs.",Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family Caregivers,10260652,R43AG071360,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Balance training', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Blood Vessels', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Failure', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family health status', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Home', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informed Consent', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lewy Bodies', 'Long-Term Care', 'Los Angeles', 'Methods', 'Multimedia', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Administration', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'behavior change', 'care costs', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'fall injury', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'preservation', 'preventive intervention', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'response', 'strength training', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIA,BROOKSIDE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT COMPANY,R43,2021,246663
"Creating adaptive, wearable technologies to assess and intervene for individuals with ADRDs PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Advances in machine learning and low-cost, wearable sensors offer a practical method for understanding, assessing, and intervening for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs) in everyday spaces. We propose to create a Behaviorome research program that will create ground-breaking methods for building health-predictive models from wearable sensor data by mapping patterns of behavior using machine learning and pervasive computing technologies. This program will create innovative multidisciplinary ideas to address NIH ADRD Milestone 11.c, Embed wearable technologies/pervasive computing in existing and new clinical research. Our research program builds on a history of interdisciplinary research contributions in areas including human behavior modeling from longitudinal sensor data and design of novel assessment and intervention mechanisms. We propose to design and validate methods for mapping a human behaviorome “in the wild”, automatically assessing cognitive and functional health from behavior markers, scaling technologies through machine learning, linking health and behavior with their influences, and closing the loop with automated interventions. Similarly, our mentoring program builds on experience training students and early- career investigators to become leaders in the field of gerontechnology. We will recruit and train graduate students and early-stage researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, to grow an institutional multidisciplinary Behaviorome research program and to establish new research programs that contribute to the targeted Milestone. We will scale the impact of mentoring by establishing a webinar series and creating youtube videos that highlight and explain breakthroughs in the design and application of Behaviorome research. Results of this program will include scripts and templates to construct a behaviorome with resource- limited wearable devices, scale data and models to large diverse populations, integrate data with multiple information sources (e.g., genetics), automate health assessment and intervention, and create understandable explanations of data and models. These will contribute to existing clinical studies such as the clinician-in-the- loop smart home, digital memory notebook, and pervasive computing measures of functional performance. Furthermore, they will lead to new clinical studies that formalize connections between health and its influences, exploration of the impact of ethnicity and the built environment on health, and the design of ADRD interventions for medication adherence, task prompting, and negative interaction de-escalation. The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on detecting and assessing ADRDs within a person's everyday environment using wearable sensing and pervasive computing methods that have not been investigated in prior work. Additionally, the mentoring steps will pave the way for a new generation of researchers to offer improved methods of addressing the need to understand, assess, and intervene for ADRDs in everyday settings, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to build a multidisciplinary research and mentoring program that will design wearable sensing and pervasive computing technologies to improve detection, assessment and intervention for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). Built on a foundation of existing research and mentoring collaboration between computer science and neuropsychology, we will design and validate methods to analyze the relationship between ADRDs and behavior. We will create robust health-predictive models from longitudinal sensor data collected in naturalistic settings and will connect health and behavior with multiple influences, such as genetics and environment, to advance quality of care and reduce functional disability associated with ADRDs.","Creating adaptive, wearable technologies to assess and intervene for individuals with ADRDs",10168052,R35AG071451,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'built environment', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'graduate student', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'smart home', 'student training', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'webinar']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,918000
"Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors PROJECT SUMMARY Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by persons with dementia (PWD), affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Agitation brings much stress and detriment to patients and caregivers. Treatment of agitation is often pharmacological intervention which can have adverse side effects. There is a great need for identification of early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation so that it can pave the way for proactive management of agitation and lower the burden on caregivers. The overall goal of this project is to address this critical unmet need through the proposed research and mentored training of the applicant. The Oregon Center for Aging & Technology (ORCATECH), under the direction of Dr. Kaye (proposed primary mentor), has more than a decade of experience developing and deploying a digital behavioral assessment platform in older adults' homes and has the experience analyzing the data collected in the clinical context of older adults. The scientific goals of this proposal are to develop digital behavioral markers that identify episodes of agitation, identify early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation, and build a risk prediction model of episodes of agitation using environmental and behavioral sensors and techniques from machine learning and time series analysis. The applicant will collect behavioral data from 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living in memory care units and 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living at their own homes using passive infrared motion sensors, wearable actigraphy devices, and bed pressure mats and follow them for 2 years. Such behavioral data will be used to identify digital behavioral markers that indicate or predict episodes of agitation. The applicant will also collect environmental data (ambient light level, noise level, temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure) from their living environments, and such data will be used to identify environmental precipitants of agitation. In order to conduct the proposed study and prepare for an independent research career, the applicant will be trained through taking courses and attending workshops in the following areas: (1) the different diagnosis and standard of care for PWD, their neuropsychiatric symptoms and their precipitants; (2) methods of using technology in dementia research; (3) novel methods from deep learning and time series analysis for building risk prediction models of agitation; and (4) development of professional skills for conducting successful and ethically responsible clinical research. The proposed team of mentors and consultant each provide expertise in one or more of these areas and are together committed to collaboratively facilitating the applicant's training. The applicant will apply these new skills to the proposed research project and obtain R01 support in order to use the methods for detecting and predicting episode of agitation to create and explore the effectiveness of early interventions for agitation in PWD. Such findings are likely to lead to improve methods for reducing and detecting episodes of agitation and ultimately help protect caregivers' physical and mental health while improving dementia care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms among persons with dementia, affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Pharmacological treatment of agitation often has adverse side effects, and time-constrained caregivers cannot reasonably be expected to monitor the patients and take continuous note of the environment to identify precipitants of agitation. The research and training for this Mentored Quantitative Research Development Award will be centered on identifying digital behavioral markers both during and preceding agitation, identifying environmental precipitants of agitation, and building risk prediction models of agitation using data collected from patients with later-stage dementia and their living environment.",Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors,10190522,K25AG071841,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Controlled Environment', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Family Caregiver', 'Formal caregiver', 'Goals', 'Home', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Activity', 'Noise', 'Nursing Records', 'Oregon', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Residential Treatment', 'Resources', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'aging and technology', 'analytical method', 'barometric pressure', 'burnout', 'care providers', 'career', 'caregiver strain', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'informal care', 'informal caregiver', 'intervention cost', 'memory care', 'motion sensor', 'multimodality', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'poor sleep', 'pressure', 'research and development', 'research study', 'residence', 'risk prediction model', 'sensor', 'side effect', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'standard of care']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K25,2021,147437
"Identification of Brain Circuit Markers for Psychosis in Alzheimer's Disease by Leveraging Big Data and Machine Learning Psychotic symptoms are among the most common and persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease, affecting over 50% of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Yet, the etiology of psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease is still poorly understood and systematic investigations have been hampered by small samples and lack of reproducible findings. Critically, robust biomarkers are needed to understand the origins/progression of psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease, and to identify targets for treatment. Newly available human neurobiological data offer an unprecedented opportunity for developing robust and predictive biomarkers for psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease. The overarching goal of our proposal is to identify robust and predictive biomarkers for psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease using a novel data-driven computational framework. Specifically, we will use a transformative “Big Data” science approach combining exciting recent advances in deep learning and our recent work on quantitative dynamic brain circuit analyses with a wealth of newly available large-scale open- source brain imaging and phenotypic data from multiple consortia, as well as data we have acquired at Stanford University. To achieve these goals, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a novel data-driven computational framework for identifying neurobiological features that distinguish between groups, leveraging recent advances in deep learning and brain circuit dynamics. In Aim 2, we will identify neurobiological features that distinguish idiopathic psychosis (schizophrenia) from neurotypical controls, using our validated computational framework and “Big” data from schizophrenia. In Aim 3, we will identify neurobiological features that distinguish Alzheimer’s disease patients with psychosis from Alzheimer’s disease patients without psychosis, using our validated computational framework and data from Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. In Aim 4, we will identify neurobiological features that predict onset of psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease. The proposed studies are highly synergistic with the goals of the PAR-20-159, which aims to “enhance knowledge of mechanisms associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in persons with Alzheimer’s disease”. Through the successful completion of the work described here, the proposed studies will transform our understanding of brain circuit mechanisms underlying psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease, and crucially, provide a new computational framework for improved mechanistic understanding of other neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease. Ultimately, these advances will lead to better diagnosis and more effective treatments for neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease and, more broadly, advance precision medicine. Psychotic symptoms occur in over 50% of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and constitute a major concern for public health, yet the underlying disease mechanisms remain unclear. The goal of this proposal is to identify robust and predictive biomarkers for psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease using a novel data-driven computational framework. The proposed work can transform our understanding of brain circuit mechanisms underlying psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease and ultimately lead to the development of more effective and precise diagnostic and treatment strategies for these debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease.",Identification of Brain Circuit Markers for Psychosis in Alzheimer's Disease by Leveraging Big Data and Machine Learning,10192576,R21AG072114,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychoses', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'big-data science', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'computer framework', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized diagnostics', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,236100
"Dementia and Value of Home Time There is a paucity of quality of life (QoL) measures for persons living with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) (hereafter called PWD). Without them, we cannot assess the effectiveness of interventions, policies, or health system investments that aim to improve QoL for PWD. Such measures must acknowledge a person’s preferences and well-being, as well as dynamic changes such as where they live and receive care day-to-day. Staying in one’s home remains the dominant preference among PWD. Therefore, if more home time reflects higher quality of life, ‘home time’ outcome measures are firmly person-centered and could assess population health using ubiquitous claims data. No consensus exists, however, on what health care settings to include in a home time measure. A key reason for our incomplete understanding is that we lack the perspectives of key stakeholders–PWD and their family and friends who help them (caregivers). Nor do we know which definitions of home time most closely relate to person-centered outcomes (PCOs) that matter to PWD. The overarching goal is to arrive at a home time measure that most closely reflects quality of life for PWD and to identify intervenable risk factors that could increase QoL by increasing home time. Importantly, distinct preferences will likely merit a caregiver-version that most closely reflects their QoL. In Aim 1, we will engage a stakeholder panel and then hold in-depth interviews to identify how quality of life for PWD and for their caregivers varies depending on the PWD’s time spent in different health care settings (e.g. emergency department, outpatient surgery, inpatient, nursing home, and assisted living). In Aim 2, we will use mixed methods to develop a single home time measure for PWD that is most closely reflective of PCOs known to matter to PWD (and a separate measure for caregivers). We will link survey data with Medicare and Medicaid claims to allow a more thorough examination of candidate settings than has ever occurred. We will integrate Aim 1 data and validation results from quantitative analyses in order to finalize a home time measure for PWD and one for caregivers. In Aim 3, we will explore how intervenable risk factors that contribute to low QoL for PWD and their caregivers relate to the newly developed home time measures. Because we do not yet understand the relative importance of home, clinical, and social risk factors or how they operate together to jointly influence home time, we will use machine learning to identify impactful risk factors. Advancing the science of home time measurement is urgent, not only for Persons living with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) and caregivers, but also for health systems, given that CMS has launched demonstration programs proposing use of a home time measure as a performance metric for payment policy design. A Policy Convening meeting will help us disseminate best practices for use of the home time measure(s) and minimize negative unintended consequences of any nationally disseminated performance measure. In addition, identifying intervenable risk factors that could be addressed to increase home time for PWD will inform future interventions and practice changes. It is critically important to develop quality of life measures for persons living with dementia (PWD) that are per- son-centered, so that we can understand the extent to which interventions, policies, and health system invest- ments improve the lives of PWD. Staying in one’s home remains the dominant preference among PWD; there- fore, ‘home time’ as a quality of life measure could be a promising means of assessing population health using ubiquitous claims data. The overarching goal of the proposed R01 study is to arrive at a ‘home time’ measure that most closely reflects quality of life for PWD and to identify intervenable risk factors that could increase the quality of life for PWD and their families by increasing home time.",Dementia and Value of Home Time,10208263,RF1AG072364,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ambulatory Surgical Procedures', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Day Care', 'Decision Trees', 'Delirium', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Emergency department visit', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retirement', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'base', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'functional decline', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'informal caregiver', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'nursing home length of stay', 'payment', 'person centered', 'population health', 'preference', 'programs', 'random forest', 'social', 'temporal measurement']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,RF1,2021,2246697
"Skilled Nursing Facility Participation in Health Information Exchange and Quality of Care for Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Each year there are 2.4 million skilled nursing facility (SNF) stays for post-acute care among Medicare fee-for- service beneficiaries. Among these patients, over 60% have Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRD). Following hospitalization, ADRD patients are four times more likely to be discharged to a SNF compared to discharged patients without ADRD. SNF patients with ADRD have worse outcomes than other SNF patients, including higher re-hospitalization rates, longer SNF stays, and a lower likelihood of being discharged back to the community. Insufficient information-sharing capabilities between the SNF, the hospital, and other providers are thought to contribute to the frequency of these events. SNFs were not eligible to receive incentive payments through the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs that led to widespread adoption of health information technology among hospitals and physicians. HIE participation is now being actively promoted by policymakers as means to improve the quality of care in SNFs. However, to date, there is little evidence of its ability to do so for SNF patients overall and no evidence for SNF patients with ADRD. This is likely due to a lack of available data on SNF participation in HIE that includes key information, such as dates of HIE participation. In this project, a novel data source will be used that includes dates of HIE participation for all SNFs participating in HIE in New York State over an eight-year period (2012-2019). These data will be merged with a 100% sample of Medicare fee-for-service claims for all beneficiaries with ADRD in the state who received care in SNFs during the study period to examine the relationship between SNF participation in HIE and the quality and the cost of care for this population. The relationship between SNF participation in HIE and the quality of care will also be examined specifically for dual-eligibles and racial minorities with ADRD, who are more likely to receive fragmented care of lower quality compared to other Medicare beneficiaries. Our research design includes both a difference-in-differences approach based on the timing of SNF participation in HIE and an instrumental variable analysis based on a patient’s residence and the differential distance between the nearest SNF with HIE and the nearest SNF without HIE. The robust study design will allow estimation strongly indicative of causation. The results of the proposed project will be important regardless of our findings. It will be the first investigation of whether HIE participation among SNFs (1) improves the quality of care, (2) lowers health care costs, or (3) reduces income and racial disparities in the quality of care for ADRD patients. The information will be useful to policymakers, SNF and hospital executives, physicians, patients, and leaders of health information exchanges. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a novel data source that provides information on the timing of skilled nursing facilities’ participation in health information exchange, this will be the first large-scale study to quantify the impact of health information exchange participation among these facilities on the quality and cost of care for patients with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRD). It will also be the first study to quantify the impact of skilled nursing facilities’ participation in health information exchange on disparities in the quality of care associated with income and race among ADRD patients.",Skilled Nursing Facility Participation in Health Information Exchange and Quality of Care for Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias,10467821,R56AG072605,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Area', 'Back', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Home', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Sampling', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care coordination', 'care costs', 'cost', 'disparity reduction', 'dual eligible', 'functional improvement', 'health information technology', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'income disparities', 'information organization', 'mortality', 'novel', 'payment', 'prevent', 'racial disparity', 'racial minority', 'readmission rates', 'residence']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R56,2021,517254
"Longitudinal predictive modeling for tau in Alzheimer's disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by a cognitively asymptomatic preclinical stage which is identified and monitored via longitudinal tracking of pathophysiological biomarkers, e.g., tau and amyloid. Since the aggregation of tau protein tangles in the medial temporal lobe is a key driver of memory impairment, accurate image-based longitudinal prediction of tau burden could fill a critical gap in biomarker development for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. Tau tangles exhibit stereotypical neuroanatomical patterns of spatiotemporal spread that correlate strongly with the progression of neurodegeneration. Studies in animal models have suggested that the characteristic patterns of tau spread associated with Alzheimer’s progression are determined by neural connectivity rather than physical proximity between different brain regions. Graph-theoretic methods that utilize macroscale structural connectivity mapping in humans to predict future tau burden could lead to valuable prognostic tools for Alzheimer’s disease. The overarching research goal of this R01 Research Project Grant is to develop an interpretable machine learning model that uses individual structural connectomics to make personalized predictions of differential measures of tau from multimodal baseline data. Our approach relies on longitudinal 18F-Flortaucipir positron emission tomography (PET) for the imaging of tau tangles, 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) for the imaging of amyloid plaques, and high-angular-resolution diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for individualized structural connectomics in human subjects. We will develop a physics-informed and interpretable graph neural network to predict the annual rate of change of the regional tau burden from multimodal inputs, including baseline tau, Aβ, and an array of structural connectivity metrics. We will also develop novel physics-based analytic models for tau progression, which will be used to effectively guide the machine learning framework. Finally, we will apply the machine learning model to investigate the earliest cortical site of tau aggregation, to examine the connectomic basis of early tau spread, and to leverage our model’s interpretability to discover and validate novel connectomic biomarkers to characterize preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To validate the machine learning model, we will use serial tau PET data at two and three timepoints from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, one of the largest longitudinal imaging resources for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To ensure scientific rigor, secondary validation of the models will be performed using data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The proposed personalized predictive model could significantly impact preclinical Alzheimer’s prognosis, facilitate ongoing clinical trials, and shed light on the neuroconnectomic and biological underpinnings of Alzheimer’s disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this Research Project Grant is to develop methods for modeling the spread of tau tangles, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, along the structural network of the brain. Novel artificial intelligence tools will be developed that accurately predict the progression of tau.

"Facilitate Observational Studies of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias Using Ontology and Natural Language Processing Project Summary As the 6th leading cause of death in the US, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5.7 million Americans. However, up until now, our understanding of risk factors of AD/ADRD is still limited and our efforts on developing effective treatments for AD/ADRD have been greatly disappointing. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new methods to conduct AD/ADRD research more efficiently. One of the potential approaches is to leverage large, longitudinal, observational clinical data accumulated in electronic health records (EHRs). Nevertheless, current uses of EHRs for AD/ADRD research is very limited, often requiring manual data extraction and normalization (i.e., manual chart review), which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, in this study, we plan to develop novel ontology and natural language processing (NLP) based informatics methods and tools to automatically extract and normalize AD/ADRD-related clinical data in EHRs, thus facilitating efficient AD/ADRD observational studies using EHRs. We propose the following three specific aims to achieve this goal: 1) Build an information model for EHR-based AD/ADRD research using a formal ontology representation approach; and 2) Extract and normalize AD/ADRD information in clinical documents using NLP technologies; and 3) Evaluate developed informatics methods and tools through demonstration studies and disseminate them to support observational AD/ADRD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we propose to develop novel informatics approaches to automatically extract detailed clinical information about Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) patients (e.g., disease diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and response) from heterogeneous electronic health records databases.

"The Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS)'s 9th-13th Annual Delirium Boot Camps: A Foundation for Future Exploration Delirium is a serious cognitive disorder associated with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) that affects ~2.6 million older adults yearly. It is a frequent complication of acute illness, surgery and, now, of COVID-19 infection in older adults. Recognizing the relative dearth of delirium research, the National Institute for Aging (NIA) supported the establishment of the Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS), a collaborative interdisciplinary group of 28 investigators, from 27 institutions, to advance delirium research and develop network infrastructure. This included the creation of an annual “NIDUS bootcamp” conference, to bring together the growing national- and international delirium research community for networking and education. The bootcamp aims are to advance the science of the field and to provide junior investigators with intensive mentorship, through mock NIH application reviews, clinical and research lectures, breakout sessions, and post-bootcamp networking. Bootcamp alumni are provided guidance on: 1) using the NIDUS Delirium Research Hub, Measurement resources and Bibliography, 2) submitting proposals to the NIDUS Pilot Program (13 one-year $50,000 grants awarded), NIA GEMSSTAR/CLINSTAR, the Alzheimer’s Association, and other foundations, 3) attending Mentoring webinars, 4) participating in Junior Faculty Working Groups, and 5) submitting research abstracts to the American Delirium Society (ADS) Annual Meeting. As PIs, 94 alumni have received 46 grants, of which 18 (40%) were NIH-funded, and published 265 original peer- reviewed articles. NIDUS has jumpstarted the careers of many young investigators, particularly bootcamp alumni, enabling them to launch independent programs in delirium research. The goal of this application is to support continuation of a yearly, themed Delirium Bootcamp Conference (DBC), to ensure that the progress of this active research community is sustained. The first-year theme will be the inter-relationship between delirium and ADRD. The Specific Aims are to: (1) Engage and support junior investigators in delirium research through mentorship and access to the NIDUS resources/network (2) Boost the researchers’ funding success (3) Facilitate publication of delirium research and provide ongoing mentorship, and (4) Facilitate networking among junior, mid-career, and senior researchers during and after DBC. As the pool of delirium investigators expands, there is a critical need for a conference focused on addressing cutting-edge research methods in all areas of delirium research, including the relationship with ADRD, “-Omics” research, machine learning and big data, innovations in randomized trials, animal models and mechanistic research, and clinical practice improvement. The DBC will provide an unparalleled opportunity to advance cutting-edge delirium research through interactive didactic sessions and in-depth guidance on complex and nuanced research methods essential for the highest caliber and most impactful delirium research. Delirium is a serious, yet understudied, cognitive disorder that affects millions of elder Americans, and is closely related to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). The NIA-supported (2015-2020) Network for Investigation of Delirium Unifying Scientists (NIDUS), a collaborative international network of delirium investigators, developed a successful, annual “NIDUS Bootcamp” conference, laying the foundation for this proposal. The new Delirium Bootcamp (DBC) will convene junior investigators and senior faculty in an annual conference with innovations including: 1) a new thematic focus each year, with the 2021 theme highlighting ADRD; 2) focus on high-impact, state-of-the-art methodologies to advance the field in new directions; 3) finding optimal methods to address the unique challenges of delirium research, and 4) developing collaborative interdisciplinary papers to be initiated at the DBC and completed in ongoing groups; thus, fostering the training, career development and success of the next generation of delirium investigators.",The Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS)'s 9th-13th Annual Delirium Boot Camps: A Foundation for Future Exploration,10237513,R13AG072860,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bibliography', 'Big Data', 'COVID-19', 'Caliber', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Delirium', 'Discipline', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Expenditures', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Science', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Study Section', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Writing', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'patient population', 'peer', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'senior faculty', 'skill acquisition', 'success', 'support network', 'symposium', 'systematic review', 'webinar', 'working group']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R13,2021,50000
"Meeting the Challenges of COVID-19 by Expanding the Reach of Palliative Care: Proactive Advance Care Planning with Videos for the Elderly and all Patients with Dementia The majority of patients aged 65 or over, and patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), have never communicated their preferences to clinicians or completed advance care planning (ACP) documents. Palliative care has the potential to improve ADRD care, improve patient-clinician communication and patient-centered outcomes, while decreasing unwanted burdensome treatments and improving care at the end of life. The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has acutely escalated the importance of integrating ACP and palliative care services into medical care. The default response to critical illness for patients with ADRD (and all others) is intubation, mechanical ventilation, and aggressive care despite having no change in mortality outcome. ADRD patients and their caregivers may prefer to avoid these interventions.  To address these gaps, we have developed a COVID-19 ACP Educator-led, video-assisted palliative care intervention to improve patient-clinician communication, increase ACP documentation, and lead to more patient-centered care at the end of life. We will identify all hospitalized patients aged 65 and older, and any patient with ADRD, and then an ACP Educator will proactively proceed with primary palliative care services of ACP, leveraging certified video decision aids that we have developed. The ACP Educator to be tested in this proposal represents a new role and proactive function for the palliative care team. The ACP Educator, who will be a palliative care nurse, will work with older patients or patients with ADRD and proxy decision-makers to learn about and document patients' wishes.  The overall objective is to reduce the burden of COVID-19 by expanding the reach of inpatient palliative care, especially for patients with ADRD. We propose to conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of an ACP Educator intervention among hospitalized patients aged 65 and over, or any patient with ADRD and their proxy decision-makers in the ward and ICU settings of two major hospitals: Boston Medical Center and North Shore University Hospital. Patient outcomes will be abstracted from electronic health records with Natural Language Processing. We will evaluate intervention effectiveness by comparing the following outcomes among 9,000 hospitalized patients: ACP documentation; preferences for resuscitation; palliative care consults; and, hospice use. We will characterize caregiver-centered outcomes of patients with ADRD, including: (1) knowledge, (2) confidence in future care, (3) communication satisfaction, and (4) decisional certainty in 600 caregivers of patients with ADRD admitted to the hospital. COVID-19 poses a unique dilemma for older Americans and patients with ADRD and their caregivers, who must balance their desire to live against the risk of a lonely and potentially traumatic hospital death. Video decision support is a practical, evidence- based, and innovative approach to assist patients facing such choices. If proven effective, this innovative care model can be immediately deployed across the country to improve the quality of care for millions of Americans. The majority of patients aged 65 or over, and patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), have never communicated their preferences to clinicians or completed advance care planning (ACP) documents. The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has acutely escalated the importance of integrating ACP and palliative care services into medical care. We aim to improve ACP with an ACP Educator who will promote ACP conversations with certified video decision aids in a model of care that is practical, scalable, and evidence-based, has the potential to mitigate communication barriers related to health literacy and limited English proficiency, and has the potential to improve the quality of medical care delivered to millions of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Meeting the Challenges of COVID-19 by Expanding the Reach of Palliative Care: Proactive Advance Care Planning with Videos for the Elderly and all Patients with Dementia,10251623,R01AG072911,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Boston', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communication', 'Communication Barriers', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Limited English Proficiency', 'Loneliness', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Palliative Care Nursing', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Proxy', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'University Hospitals', 'Work', 'aged', 'care systems', 'compare effectiveness', 'dementia care', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health literacy', 'hospice environment', 'human old age (65+)', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'older patient', 'palliative', 'pandemic disease', 'patient-clinician communication', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'visual information', 'ward']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,2487017
"Down Syndrome: Toward Optimal Trajectories and Health Equity using Medicaid Analytic eXtract (DS -TO-THE-MAX) PROJECT ABSTRACT Down syndrome (DS), a trisomy of chromosome 21 and the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, was once a condition in which children would rarely see adulthood. In 1950, the estimated mean life expectancy for a person with DS was 26 years and median age at death was 4 years. With improvements in recognition and treatment of co-occurring conditions of DS, such as congenital heart defects, the estimated median life expectancy in 2010 was 53 years (median age at death was 58). There is now a large and diverse population with DS across all ages who are in dire need of solutions and treatments for medical issues that were inconceivable 60 years ago. Two conditions of high interest that often presage other morbidity, greatly harm quality of life, and lead to premature mortality are obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and dementia. OSA is an episodic sleep-state collapse of the upper airway which results in reduction or lack of ventilation during sleep and is prevalent in more than half of people with DS. The triplication of chromosome 21 in DS is associated with an overproduction of the amyloid precursor protein and is pivotal to the accelerated development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Even when not the proximal cause of death, in post-mortem autopsy nearly all older adults with DS have beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that signify Alzheimer's disease. More needs to be known about causes, course, and the impact of social determinants on these conditions and resulting premature mortality, especially as clinical DS samples are often under powered and often lack participants of color. To meet the directives of the National Institutes of Health's Investigation of Co-occurring conditions across the lifespan in Down syndrome project and the National Institute on Aging's priorities we propose to create Down Syndrome: Towards Optimal Trajectories and Health Equity using Medicaid Analytic eXtract (DS-TO-THE-MAX). DS-TO-THE-MAX will identify a retrospective longitudinal cohort of >100,000 adults with DS and >4,000,000 adults without DS from 10 years of Medicaid Analytic eXtract data plus additional Medicare data for dual enrollees. Our innovation lies in a DS sample orders of magnitude larger than past work, a social determinants of health framework, and novel machine learning and quantitative bias analysis methods. We will complete two aims: 1) Assess epidemiology and social determinants of obstructive sleep apnea, dementia, and mortality 2) Use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for obstructive sleep apnea, dementia, and mortality. The results of this project will strengthen the epidemiologic and public health basis for DS research and population level intervention. In building the DS-TO THE MAX cohort and assessing risk, resilience, social determinants we will have a vital big data set to complement clinical research and work toward the population with DS living long, healthy, and self-determined lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE While lifespan has greatly expanded for people with Down syndrome (DS) in the last seventy years, the population still experiences burdensome morbidities and premature mortality. This project contributes to public health knowledge by developing the Down Syndrome: Towards Optimal Trajectories and Health Equity using Medicaid Analytic eXtract Project (DS-TO-THE-MAX), a 10-year retrospective cohort of >100,000 adults with and >4,000,000 adults without DS enrolled in Medicaid, a US public health insurance program for low income and / or disabled people. With these data, we will describe epidemiology, identify risks and social determinants, and use machine learning to identify factors that may predict occurrence or resilience of obstructive sleep apnea, dementia, and mortality in a diverse sample orders of magnitude larger than previous DS studies.",Down Syndrome: Toward Optimal Trajectories and Health Equity using Medicaid Analytic eXtract (DS -TO-THE-MAX),10274393,R01AG073179,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'African American', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor', 'Autopsy', 'Big Data', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chromosome 21', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Down Syndrome', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Research', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Trisomy', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'classification trees', 'cohort', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'health equity', 'health knowledge', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'mortality', 'novel', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'racism', 'random forest', 'regression trees', 'resilience', 'sex', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'success', 'treatment guidelines', 'trend', 'ventilation']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,2124301
"TRiPOD: Toward Reusable Phenotypes in Observational Data for AD/ADRD - managing definitions and correcting bias Project Summary Large observational data such as electronic health records (EHRs) and medical claims have become an enabling source for facilitating clinical and translational research including Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementia (AD/ADRD). One major challenge for conducting observational AD/ADRD studies is about phenotyping – there is a lack of a centralized repository for hosting and standardizing phenotype definitions in AD/ADRD research and few methods have been developed to address bias associated with phenotyping errors in observation data. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to fully develop a joint effort between medical informaticians, statisticians, clinicians, and epidemiologists with a focus on building a rigorous set of methods and tools for managing phenotype definitions and for correcting bias in observational data analysis, through modern knowledge engineering and data-driven statistical modeling. To achieve that goal, we propose three specific aims in this study: (1) Aim 1 - Collect, normalize, and share definitions of common phenotypes used in AD/ADRD observational research; (2) Aim 2 - Develop novel algorithms to correct bias associated with phenotyping errors when users apply existing phenotype definitions to local data; and (3) Aim 3 - Validate, refine, and disseminate proposed methods and tools by demonstration studies and community engagement. We believe informatics methods and tools proposed here will improve current practice on phenotypic data management and analysis, thus enhancing the reproducibility and quality of observational studies on AD/ADRD. Project Narrative Observational data, including electronic health records (EHR) and claims data, provide tremendous opportunities for clinical and translational research for Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementia (AD/ADRD). A key challenge is observational AD/ADRD research is to better manage and analyze phenotypic data.

"The Caregiver Resource Room: Enhancing Support for Caregivers of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With nearly 6 million cases of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) diagnosed in the United States in 2019, the health and well-being of ADRD caregivers is of critical importance. Promoting the health and well-being of ADRD caregivers is an effective way to support these unpaid staples of ADRD care. Although interventions targeting ADRD caregivers continues to accelerate, little attention has been paid to caregivers’ use of supportive services, which remains strikingly low. The objective of this K99/R00 application is to enable Dr. Falzarano to develop the necessary expertise to design, implement, and evaluate studies focused on leveraging technology to support and address ADRD caregivers’ multifarious needs. In the K99 phase, Dr. Falzarano will work toward achieving five training objectives that will prepare her to transition to become an independent investigator who designs and evaluates evidence-based technologies to enhance tailored caregiver support. First, she will extend her knowledge in substantive areas including dementia caregiving and front-end and back-end software development. Second, she will learn how to develop, implement, and test behavioral interventions with an emphasis on collaboration with community partners. Third, she will receive training in statistical methods to examine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Fourth, she will learn about measurement development and psychometric validation of assessments for ADRD caregivers. Fifth, Dr. Falzarano will pursue professional development activities, particularly in the areas of grant writing, leadership, and integration of research and web development teams. The four proposed research aims were chosen to complement the areas identified for career development. Aim 1a will provide the requisite training and experiences to provide Dr. Falzarano with the critical skills needed to conduct the proposed study. Aim 1b will include interviews with ADRD caregivers to identify needs, awareness of, barriers to, and willingness to use services. Aim 1c will leverage key stakeholder (dementia-care experts) input to identify existing services corresponding to areas of need identified in Aim 1b. Aim 2 will leverage data collected from caregivers and stakeholders to inform the iterative development and design of the Caregiver Resource Room (CRR) website, which will include a digital self-assessment tool using machine learning models to identify and categorize needs and provide an output of targeted service recommendations. Aim 3 will include an analysis of the tool’s content, design, features, and services output, which will be iteratively refined based on ADRD caregiver feedback. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Aim 4 to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the CRR as a tool to enhance awareness of and access to relevant services to address unmet needs and improve mental health. The proposed research is well-aligned with the NIA’s strategic initiative to foster the development of research scientists in aging and to develop and test promising interventions to improve ADRD caregiver outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The multifarious needs of ADRD caregivers often remain unaddressed, and the utilization rate of supportive services remains strikingly low, with many caregivers uncertain about what services may be right for them, what exists, and how to access them. There is a need for a robust, reliable tool that comprehensively evaluates ADRD caregiver needs with a mechanism to connect needs with existing services, thereby overcoming barriers that ADRD caregivers face in accessing needed supportive care. The proposed project seeks to iteratively develop and test an online self-assessment and tailored referral platform, grounded in machine learning principles and informed by stakeholder perspectives, to address needs and enhance knowledge and use of relevant services, with the overall goal of linking ADRD caregivers with relevant support and thereby promoting their mental health and well-being.",The Caregiver Resource Room: Enhancing Support for Caregivers of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD),10284406,K99AG073509,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregiver well-being', 'Caregivers', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'E-learning', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grief reaction', 'Guilt', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Immersion', 'Institutionalization', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Psychologist', 'Psychometrics', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Self Assessment', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Support Groups', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Writing', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'adverse outcome', 'anxiety symptoms', 'apprenticeship', 'base', 'behavior test', 'care costs', 'career development', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiver interventions', 'caregiving', 'computer human interaction', 'dementia care', 'dementia caregiving', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'handbook', 'help-seeking behavior', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neglect', 'novel strategies', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'research and development', 'respite care', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'skills', 'social', 'social stigma', 'software development', 'stakeholder perspectives', 'support tools', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web site', 'web-based tool', 'willingness']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2021,119055
"Exploring the Use of Deep Learning Neural Networks to Improve Dementia Detection: Automating Coding of the Clock-Drawing Test Project Summary  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), a leading cause of disability among older adults, has become a critical public health concern. The clock-drawing test (CDT), which measures multiple aspects of cognitive function including comprehension, visual spatial abilities, executive function and memory, has been widely used as a screening tool to detect dementia in clinical research, epidemiologic studies, and panel surveys. The CDT asks subjects to draw a clock, typically with hands showing ten after 11, and then assigns either a binary (e.g. normal vs. abnormal) or ordinal (e.g. 0 to 5) score. An important limitation in large-scale studies is that the CDT requires manual coding, which could result in biases if coders interpret and implement coding rules in different ways.  Several small-scale studies have explored the use of machine learning methods to automate CDT coding. Such studies, which have had limited success with ordinal coding, have used methods that are not designed specifically for complex image classification and are less effective than deep learning neural networks (DLNN), a new and promising area of machine learning. More recently, machine learning methods have been applied to digital CDT (dCDT), a form of CDT that uses a digital pen and tablet. Despite some promising results on small- scale data, thus far dCDT studies have only attempted to code binary categories.  The proposed study will develop advanced DLNN models to create and evaluate an intelligent CDT Clock Scoring system – CloSco – that will automatically code CDT images. We will use a large, publicly available repository of CDT images from the 2011-2019 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a panel study of Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 and older funded by the National Institute on Aging. Specifically, we will: 1) Develop an automated CDT-coding system for both ordinal and continuous scores; 2) Evaluate the performance of the CloSco system and investigate the value of continuous CDT scoring for dementia classification and longitudinal CDT models; and 3) Prepare and disseminate NHATS public-use files and documentation with ordinal and continuous CDT codes assigned using CloSco along with the CloSco DLNN program. If successful, the DLNN programs may offer a model for automating coding of other widely available drawing tests used to evaluate a variety of cognitive functions. Project Narrative This project aims to improve dementia detection by automating coding of a widely used dementia screening test, the Clock Drawing Test (CDT). The proposed research will improve CDT-coding in large scale studies, facilitate longitudinal analysis of CDT performance, and improve dementia classification particularly for mild cognitive impairment.",Exploring the Use of Deep Learning Neural Networks to Improve Dementia Detection: Automating Coding of the Clock-Drawing Test,10293176,R21AG073971,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease test', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Family health status', 'Funding', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Respondent', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Visuospatial', 'Writing', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cognitive function', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'public repository', 'repository', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2021,406555
"Combining information from multiple circadian activity rhythm metrics to optimally detect mild cognitive impairment using a consumer wearable Abstract: Widely-scalable methods for the earlier detection of elevated Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) would enable earlier intervention and can help reduce/delay disease incidence. Consumer wearable technologies that passively gather “big data” signals could be leveraged to detect the early signs of elevated ADRD risk (see NOT-AG-20-017), in a relatively inexpensive and scalable fashion. One promising set of signals that can be captured by consumer wearable devices, but are currently only assessed in research settings, reflects the Circadian Activity Rhythm (CAR). Human activity follows a predictable 24-hour pattern known as the CAR. Various CAR characteristics are disrupted in ADRDs, reflect ADRD biomarkers levels (even in the pre-clinical stage), and predict future cognitive decline. However, observational studies have yet to conclusively demonstrate which CAR measure(s) best signal early-stage ADRD processes, and could help with early risk stratification. Previous studies have used subsets of the available CAR metrics to establish associations, rather than leveraging multiple metrics to improve ADRD risk prediction. We propose that using a comprehensive panel of CAR metrics could identify combinations of CAR metrics that are sensitive to ADRD risk. Furthermore, we propose that the translation of research findings into clinical screening has been difficult because CAR measurement relies on researcher-, rather than clinic-/user-, friendly systems. To fill these gaps, we propose leveraging consumer wearables, existing data, sleep/circadian science, and machine learning. Our overarching goal is to evaluate evidence for a path forward, from observing associations, towards clinically useful ADRD risk detection with consumer wearables. Our team includes experts in sleep/CAR-related health risks (Dr. Smagula, PI); neuropsychology and activity in aging (Dr. Gujral, co-I); and time series analytics/statistical learning (Dr. Krafty, co-I). We partnered with leaders of major cohorts (see letters of support) that provide the initial data. Aim 1 will compute a comprehensive panel of CAR measures in a sample of 766 adults aged 50+; then use machine learning to develop algorithms leveraging CAR measures to predict the likelihood of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI; a diagnostic marker of elevated ADRD risk). Aim 2 will use a new testing sample (n=25 with and n=25 without MCI) to validate if applying this algorithm to data from a consumer-wearable accurately detects MCI. Dr. Smagula already developed a working prototype measuring CARs using the Apple Watch called the Circadian Activity Profiling System. This R21 can have impact on the field of ADRD risk detection by producing: evidence regarding which CAR metrics best signal MCI; an initial algorithm that combines information regarding CARs to passively detect the likelihood of MCI; and by refining our system for collecting these signals on a popular consumer wearable (the Apple Watch). We will also develop collaborations with additional cohorts so that, if we find evidence supporting potential clinical utility of this approach, we will be prepared to develop a definitive algorithm in an R01 using data from multiple studies. Project narrative: Evidence shows that circadian rest-activity rhythm (CAR) disruption correlates with dementia biomarkers in the pre-clinical phase, and predicts increased likelihood of future dementia incidence. Using archival data and consumer wearables, this project will develop and test a widely-scalable system to identify individuals who have elevated dementia risk by virtue of their CAR profile. Deliverables are an initial predictive algorithm, partnerships with additional sources of archival data for future work, and initial validation that this approach can discriminate between older adults with and without early signs of increased dementia risk.",Combining information from multiple circadian activity rhythm metrics to optimally detect mild cognitive impairment using a consumer wearable,10300129,R21AG074094,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animals', 'Apple watch', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging', 'Fractals', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos', 'Hour', 'Human Activities', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention approach', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'circadian', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'glymphatic clearance', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable behavior', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'routine care', 'scale up', 'screening', 'statistical learning', 'systematic review', 'user-friendly', 'wearable device']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,245140
"Technology-Enabled Financial Planning for Caregivers and Clients with Reduced Capacity Abstract Caregivers of older adults with ADRD are the largest unpaid, and untrained healthcare workforce in the US, with family caregiving valued at $470 billion in 2013 (higher than total Medicaid spending for the same year). The temptation to take advantage of an impaired loved one may be exacerbated by the stress of taking over disorganized finances and absence of guidance. Lack of clinically guided financial support can also remove financial control from the person suffering from ADRD prematurely. The decision to transfer control is typically made by the untrained caregiver acting on instincts, not by a trained clinician (who does not typically advise on finances) or financial advisor (who does not have clinical training). Each year, around 15% of U.S. seniors are targeted by financial exploitation resulting in nearly $17 billion in losses annually. In over a third of these cases, $6.6 billion is lost to theft enabled by a trusting relationship with a caregiver (called elder financial abuse) annually, and even this may be an under-estimation. AARP describes an average loss of $120k per victim, almost what an average 50+ household has in savings. The stress and isolation of unpaid caregiver workload may lead to resentment and increased risk of financial abuse. There is a need for increased communication, education, and a clinically validated methodology for determining when it is necessary to begin transfer of control over finances. BSM proposes to develop a one-stop-shop technology enabled solution to address these three problems usable by a financial planner, older adult client, and caregiver. Project Narrative Caregivers of persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD) (also known as People with Dementia, or PwD) are a community in dire need of caregiver assistance, education, and training resources, including assistive-technology platforms.

"Covering Care: Long-term care planning and education tool for AD/ADRD caregivers Project Summary/Abstract  Older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) need a trusted financial advocate to help orchestrate and oversee their care as they age. Spousal and adult child caregivers need comprehensive education around financial caregiving and tools on how to access resources to pay for long- term services and supports (LTSS). This SBIR project will create an easy-to-use online decision tree-based tool to give a caregiver the exact knowledge they need to plan for long-term care financing without overwhelming them with unnecessary information. We focus on the extremely complex problem of helping caregivers understand Medicaid while providing customized recommendations for Medicaid eligibility planning.  Our financial management and LTSS planning and education tool—the Assistant—will be designed for the spousal or adult child caregiver who can navigate websites but who has very little understanding of public programs that help pay for LTSS and how to access them. Medicaid planning is extremely complex and eligibility rules vary from state to state. Most caregivers do not have the financial or prior caregiving experience to know how to navigate the process of becoming eligible for the program or how to finance LTSS in general. Caregivers often start by getting advice from friends or by searching online. Lack of tailored information can lead to financial missteps that can delay individuals with AD/ADRD from getting the level of care they need, or result in the caregiver tapping into their own savings to pay for LTSS. Other mistakes include depleting assets too quickly or improper wealth transfers that may extend periods of ineligibility. If the person with AD/ADRD has a spouse residing in the home, that individual's financial security is at risk in the absence of proper planning.  To address these needs, we propose to develop an online “Assistant” that: (1) educates spousal and adult child caregivers about long-term care financing/Medicaid eligibility in English and Spanish, (2) collects information on the care recipients' assets and disability status to provide customized recommendations needed to execute the next steps in planning and enrollment, and (3) if desired, refers caregivers to planning professionals like Certified Medicaid Planners (CMPs), elder law attorneys, Agencies of Aging, or to the appropriate government office. In order to increase uptake, trustworthiness, enjoyment, and usability of the Assistant, we will use an innovative conversational agent, driven by a decision tree database and certified provider database. Project Narrative In the next decade the number of family caregivers of adults is expected to increase to 45 million while the number of individuals potentially requiring care is anticipated to reach 117 million. Caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) need financial management and legal planning education to ensure that they can access resources to help pay for long-term care and reduce the financial strain and uncertainty in caring for a person with AD/ADRD.",Covering Care: Long-term care planning and education tool for AD/ADRD caregivers,10301286,R44AG074135,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Friends', 'Government', 'Home', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Laws', 'Lawyers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Long-Term Care', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid eligibility', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Occupational activity of managing finances', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Security', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spouses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'care recipients', 'caregiving', 'commercialization', 'cost estimate', 'design', 'disability', 'education planning', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'loved ones', 'programs', 'prototype', 'response', 'sound', 'tool', 'trustworthiness', 'two-dimensional', 'uptake', 'usability', 'web app', 'web site']",NIA,"MOAI TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2021,299812
"Multiclass classification under prioritized error control and specific error costs with applications to dementia classification Project Summary Fifty million people worldwide have dementia, and there are nearly 10 million new cases every year. The subtypes of dementia include Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies, and a group of diseases that contribute to frontotemporal dementia. Early and accurate diagnosis of the dementia cause is crucial because it can lead to the timely provision of symptomatic treatment and avoidance of medications that may worsen symptoms and assist in developing and evaluating new drugs and gaining access to effective treatments when they become available. There has thus been extensive research on developing accurate classifiers (e.g., linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, multiclass logistic regression, random forests, boosting, convolutional neural network) to automatically classify dementia into different classes. In most existing work, the classifiers are designed to maximize overall accuracy. Since different types of classification error may have different consequences (costs), it is highly desirable to develop multiclass classifiers with prioritized error control. There is a rich literature on binary classifiers that minimize the false negative rate, with false positive rate controlled under a particular level. A prominent example is the Neyman-Pearson classification framework. However, the extension of the framework to multiclass classification, in conjunction with the desired prioritized error controls, while of vital importance, remains largely unknown. This project fills this gap by developing a general framework for multiclass classification with controls for misclassification errors, while imposing various (relative) costs for another set of misclassification error types. This can be viewed as a unification of cost-sensitive learning and the Neyman-Pearson classification in the multiclass setting. The new methodological development will optimize clinical diagnosis in the multiclass setting and expedite drug discovery through more efficient clinical trials. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. To propose a flexible framework that includes prioritized error control requirements as well as costs for various classification error types, and develop an efficient umbrella algorithm to solve the associated constrained optimization problem. Aim 2. To study the feasibility of the optimization problem and the properties of the umbrella algorithm. Aim 3. To evaluate the proposed algorithm via extensive simulation studies, apply it to dementia subtype classification, and develop a publicly available R package. Project Narrative Dementia is a common syndrome with many different causes include Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and a group of diseases that contribute to frontotemporal dementia. We introduce a general framework for multiclass classification that can control selected types of misclassification errors, while imposing various costs for another set of misclassification error types.

"Air Pollution and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias: A National Study Dementia is a major public health challenge with substantial economic and social burden, affecting more than 47 million people worldwide. Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes about two-thirds of dementia cases and is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and the only diagnosis among the top 10 that cannot be cured. There is a pressing need to support Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) patients by identifying novel and modifiable risk factors that may reduce morbidity. Emerging evidence suggests that air pollution – in particular fine particulate matter (PM2.5) – plays an important role in AD/ADRD pathogenesis. However, little is known about the relative contributions of different air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, ozone), nor about PM2.5 components. To facilitate the targeting of pollution control efforts, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have placed a high priority on determining which air pollutants and/or which components of PM2.5 are most toxic. In addition, one major gap in the emerging epidemiologic evidence on air pollution and AD/ADRD morbidity is that many previous studies have relied on hospitalizations as the measure of morbidity. Yet, hospitalization is not the typical course for AD/ADRD diagnosis and initial treatment. Instead, if it does occur for patients, hospitalization happens during the more advanced stages of the disease and usually for treating complications of the disease. Thus, hospitalization records do not accurately reflect disease incidence, and thus underestimate case numbers. Therefore, we propose a study that will leverage the massive datasets of high-resolution environmental exposure data and Medicare claims (including doctor visits where most AD/ADRD diagnoses would occur) across the contiguous US to better understand the influence of air pollution on AD/ADRD morbidity among US elderly, and identify potential vulnerable subpopulations, with the ultimate goal of informing environmental policy. We will (1) generate and validate a comprehensive, high- resolution, multiple-species, air pollution dataset across the contiguous US for 2000-2021, including criteria air pollutants (PM2.5 mass, NO2, and ozone), PM2.5 components (including trace metals), as well as aerosol water and fine particle pH that may influence metal dissolution; (2) estimate the chronic effects of criteria pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, and ozone) on AD/ADRD risks using the nationwide Medicare Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) database, which includes Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims, doctor visits, skilled nursing facility, and home health-care claims for AD/ADRD among ~100 million Medicare beneficiaries; (3) assess the relative contributions of PM2.5 components and potential effect modification by aerosol water/pH on AD/ADRD risks using the nationwide Medicare cohort; and (4) conduct sensitivity analyses by correcting for exposure measurement error and outcome misclassification. Our proposed research will fill major knowledge gaps in the epidemiology of environmental exposures and AD/ADRD morbidity, and inform policy for targeted source-specific regulations and facilitate actionable measures that can prevent or mitigate the AD health burden due to air pollution. Project Narrative We will use advanced statistical methods to quantify the evidence of associations between ambient air pollution and AD/ADRD to better frame environmental policy. Leveraging national datasets capturing over 100 million Medicare beneficiaries, we will assess multiple types of air pollutants, including criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, and ozone) and various PM2.5 chemical components. This work will fill major gaps in the epidemiology of environmental exposures and AD/ADRD morbidity, which can inform policy for targeted source-specific regulations with the greatest health protection that can potentially mitigate the AD/ADRD health burden due to air pollution.",Air Pollution and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias: A National Study,10301914,R01AG074357,"['Acidity', 'Address', 'Aerosols', 'Affect', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ammonia', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Policy', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health protection', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Metals', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Ozone', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Pollution', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Trace metal', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Water', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'ambient air pollution', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'dementia risk', 'fine particles', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'machine learning method', 'modifiable risk', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'pollutant', 'prevent', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'systemic inflammatory response']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,732182
"Characterizing sleep-wake activity patterns to detect early Alzheimer's disease in normal older individuals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent work has established a connection between disrupted sleep and Alzheimer’s disease that begins many years before memory impairment or dementia. Many of the brain regions involved in regulating daily patterns of sleep-wake behavior are also the earliest to be affected in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, understanding how sleep-wake patterns change during the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease may lead to better disease detection and treatment intervention strategies. Actigraphy watches, which use technology similar to the accelerometers in our phones and smartwatches, can be used to collect sleep-wake activity data outside the laboratory on a massive scale. By analyzing sleep-wake activity collected from thousands of cognitively healthy older adults, this project will determine whether differences in daily activity patterns are able to forecast subsequent memory decline and Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis. Additionally, in order to understand how early Alzheimer’s disease-related changes in the brain affect sleep, we will collect brain imaging and fluid markers of Alzheimer’s disease along with sleep-wake rhythm data from a local cohort of older adults. High-resolution structural brain imaging, combined with sleep-wake activity phenotypes, will allow for the identification of sleep- wake dysfunction signatures linked to specific pathological brain changes. This research proposal leverages big data in parallel with rich neuroimaging in a multimodal approach which will advance our understanding of the relationship between sleep and Alzheimer’s disease with important clinical implications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease is associated with disruptions in sleep and daytime activity that can begin many years before memory impairment or dementia. This project will analyze sleep-wake activity collected from healthy older adults to test how changes in daily activity patterns are related to changes in the brain in early Alzheimer’s disease. A clearer understanding of the relationship between sleep-wake dysfunction and early Alzheimer’s disease will lead to improvements in early disease detection and intervention.",Characterizing sleep-wake activity patterns to detect early Alzheimer's disease in normal older individuals,10313891,F32AG074625,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Memory impairment', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Fragmentations', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'aging population', 'behavior change', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'cohort', 'dentate gyrus', 'high dimensionality', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'noradrenergic', 'pre-clinical', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep regulation', 'smart watch', 'tau Proteins', 'ultra high resolution']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,65610
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed health systems, caregivers, and patients for over a year. Hundreds of thousands have died, and millions more have been impacted by the threat of infection and efforts to mitigate disease spread. In response to these challenges, the Medicare program introduced emergency policies that permitted greater flexibility in the provision of outpatient and inpatient care, including relaxing rules governing the remote delivery of outpatient care and increasing hospital capacity. Unfortunately, there is limited information on how the changes in care delivery made possible by these temporary policies have impacted patient outcomes during times when viral spread and mitigation policies both waxed and waned. In this project, we will examine the impact of changes in outpatient and inpatient care on clinical event rates and deaths among older patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) living in the community. These patients are particularly vulnerable to social isolation or disruptions in their care, and might not be able to articulate their needs. Those with yet additional disadvantages such as frailty or lower incomes appear to have been even more susceptible to adverse effects of COVID-19 infections. Some care delivery changes, however, might have increased the number or quality of clinician interactions with patients, e.g., more frequent tele-health visits because of less need to travel. Thus, to examine the impact of the changes in care delivery under the emergency Medicare policies, we will address three aims: 1) To assess and refine study variable definitions given data collected during the pandemic; 2) To examine the impact of changes in outpatient care on clinical event rates, e.g., emergency department and hospitalization rates; and 3) To examine the impact of changes in inpatient care on mortality. Notably, changes in visit and referral patterns during the pandemic could impact information capture; thus, diagnosis-based definitions of AD/ADRD status, frailty, or delirium developed in the pre-pandemic era could be less accurate when using pandemic era data. We will examine these care patterns, assess the accuracy of claims-based measures, and develop prediction models using machine learning methods and linked, overlapping datasets; we also will account for temporal variation in documented COVID-19 infections and employment at the county level across all aims. Given these complex data and analytic issues, we will work with NIH’s Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research on COVID-19 Consortium to improve the data resources and methods for this type of work. The information from this large natural experiment is critical for preparing for future outbreaks or other shocks to the health system, to determine which of the emergency policies, if any, should be extended, and to inform debates concerning the balance between local flexibility and national standards within Medicare. Narrative. The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak overwhelmed many health care systems despite the increased ability to deliver care remotely and expansions in hospital capacity that the public health emergency made possible. There is, however, limited information on how vulnerable groups of patients fared during the pandemic or why patients in some areas had better or worse outcomes than those in other areas. The complexity of the issues and data to address them makes working together with a national consortium the logical way to address questions of how to manage future outbreaks and identify which changes made during the pandemic should be kept when the pandemic ends.",Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias,10423845,U01AG076478,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Advance Directives', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ambulances', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Death Certificates', 'Delirium', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Drug usage', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Employment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Race', 'Reference Standards', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retirement', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Shock', 'Social Distance', 'Social isolation', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'beneficiary', 'care delivery', 'cognitive function', 'complex data', 'coronavirus disease', 'data resource', 'disease transmission', 'ethnic minority population', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'inpatient service', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'patient home care', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health emergency', 'racial and ethnic', 'remote delivery', 'remote health care', 'response', 'social', 'social factors', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'telehealth', 'time use']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2021,857976
"Validation of Biomarkers of Small Vessel Injury in VCID This proposal is in response to RFA-NS-21-005, which is a continuation of RFA-NS-16-020. The overall goal of the project is to study the impact of vascular disease on Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Small vessel disease is the major vascular disease associated with dementia. Cerebral small vessel diseases such as arteriolosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are independently associated with worse cognitive performance and greater likelihood of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). MarkVCID1 consortium shared subject clinical neuropsychological test data, MRI results and biological samples to validate the biomarkers. The NIH identified 11 biomarkers from MarkVCID1 that could be used in future clinical trials. The UNM site made major contributions to both the MRI and fluid biomarkers: UNM and UCD led the work on the Free Water (FW) biomarker, and contributed data to all of the other MRI biomarkers. UNM was one of the few centers that collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and matched blood on all subjects, contributing to all of the fluid biomarkers selected to move into MarkVCID2. Our group contributed CSF and blood samples to multiple sites for validation of the angiogenic and inflammatory biomarker kits, including CSF placental growth factor (PlGF), and blood exosomes and endothelial inflammation kits. We used MesoScale Discovery assays for fluid analysis, and have recently purchased a Quanterix HD-X single molecule assay (SIMOA) instrument that we will use it to measure neurofilament light (NfL) and PlGF. The UNM Specific aims are: 1) to continue to lead to development of the FW biomarker kit in collaboration with UCD to make this trial ready and to add imaging data to the other MRI biomarkers kits; 2) to continue to collect CSF and blood samples to contribute to the validation of all the CSF and blood biomarker kits; and 3) to recruit 200 new underrepresented patients over two years to add to legacy subjects. UMN anticipates to have longitudinal data for 3 years on many participants. UNM has a large number of patients with VCID, AD, and mixed dementias, as well as subjective cognitive complaints that have been studied as part of two RO1 grants (2006-2016) and the MarkVCID1 (2016- present) with data on clinical cognitive test results, MRI, CSF, and blood. Many of these patients have longitudinal data from multiple follow-ups. UNM is committed to achieving the goals and milestones laid out by NIH for MarkVCID2, and to contribute to the completion of the evaluation of the biomarkers that will be used with study-ready cohorts for clinical trials in vascular cognitive impairment. Narrative During MarkVCID1, the 7-center consortium developed a series of biomarkers of which NIH selected 11 for further testing in MarkVCID2. UNM was the leader with UCD for the Free Water MRI kit, which will be biologically validated and studied longitudinally. In MarkVCID2, UNM will continue to validate all of the other MRI biomarkers and to provide data to support all of the fluid biomarkers that are advancing; we will recruit 200 diverse patients over 2 years as well as continue assessments of our MarkVCID1 cohort to include in the study-ready population.",Validation of Biomarkers of Small Vessel Injury in VCID,10369502,UF1NS100598,"['Advisory Committees', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'New Mexico', 'PGF gene', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Water', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Work', 'biomarker evaluation', 'biomarker validation', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical examination', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'exosome', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'instrument', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'mixed dementia', 'neurofilament', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'potential biomarker', 'recruit', 'response', 'single molecule', 'vascular cognitive impairment and dementia', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,UF1,2021,2441705
"Longitudinal validation of cerebral small vessel disease biomarkers in diverse community-based older adults without dementia ABSTRACT Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) encompasses a range of common processes and pathologies (arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, small vessel atherosclerosis, small and microscopic infarcts and bleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces, and white matter disease) that we and others have shown are associated with impaired cognition and dementia (VCID). High-quality biomarkers of SVD are critically needed to advance the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of small vessel VCID. The mission of the MarkVCID consortium has been to identify the most promising biomarkers of SVD and conduct analytical (instrumental) validation and preliminary clinical validation. Our team at Rush University Medical Center and Illinois Institute of Technology was privileged to be active participants in this initial work. We are now eager to continue this collaborative effort with this proposal. The objective of the proposed project is to conduct rigorous longitudinal clinical validation of MarkVCID-selected biomarkers in a diverse cohort free of dementia, and to investigate the associations of these biomarkers with SVD neuropathologic indices, working synergistically with other consortium sites and contributing scientific expertise, experimental infrastructure, and scientific guidance. Specifically, we propose to recruit, enroll, and longitudinally assess a large, diverse, community-based group of older adults without dementia using MarkVCID clinical evaluation and biomarkers, to test the hypotheses that the biomarkers are associated with cognitive decline and SVD neuropathologic indices. This will be a nested sub-study of participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), Religious Orders Study (ROS), Clinical Core (CC), and Latino Core (LATC) of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, which are on-going longitudinal, clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates. MARS and CC recruit exclusively African Americans, and LATC recruits Latino older adults. Our past contributions to MarkVCID support our current aims. First, we demonstrated our ability to recruit and follow a large and diverse group of non-demented older adults, some of whom died, enabling autopsy studies. Second, we developed and made publicly available a novel biomarker of arteriolosclerosis with high performance, named ARTS, which we trained using machine learning on MRI and pathology data. Third, we contributed to the analytical and initial clinical validation of multiple MarkVCID biomarkers. Fourth, we led the MarkVCID imaging biomarkers committee and were active in all functions of the consortium. We propose to leverage our expertise and infrastructure to conduct rigorous longitudinal clinical validation of MarkVCID biomarkers in a diverse population, and to investigate the associations of these biomarkers with SVD neuropathologic indices.

"Studying Aggregation in Neurodegenerative Disease Using Synthetic Proteins Protein misfolding and aggregation to form fibrils are common features of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and related dementias such as Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Multiple System Atrophy. Drugs that reverse or block protein aggregation, combined with early diagnosis, provide the prospect for a cure that preserves the patient's memories. To design such drugs and diagnostic agents, one must understand the process of aggregation within neurons and propagation to “infect” new neurons to identify the most relevant targets. In this funding period, we propose to use distance measurements made with fluorescence and crosslinking probes to drive computational models of the misfolding and aggregation of the proteins α-synuclein (αS) and tau. We will model not only monomeric αS and tau, but also aggregated forms that are not amenable to characterization by solid state NMR (ssNMR) or cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our computational models will be used to predict the binding of small molecules in order to validate their molecular details and establish their potential for use in the design of inhibitors and diagnostic agents. Our methods can also be used to study different misfolded αS and tau polymorphs, which exhibit different tendencies to form new fibrils and different levels of cytotoxicity. For example, recent investigations of αS, the primary aggregator in Parkinson's Disease, have shown that tau fibrils can be seeded by some conformational forms (“strains”) of αS fibrils, but not others. We will investigate the chemical scale differences in structure between αS strains and the basis for tau fibril seeding by certain strains. This will shed important insight on the pathology of Parkinson's Disease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and Multiple System Atrophy; it will also set the stage for investigations of other secondary tau pathologies, such as Aβ-seeded tau aggregates in Alzheimer's Disease. The aggregation of proteins into neurotoxic oligomers (clusters) and ultimately into fibrillar tangles plays a pivotal role in the progression of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and related dementias. The proposed research will study the structures of these protein aggregates to gain insight into the mechanism of their aggregation and the propagation of pathology from cell-to-cell, as well as the ways in which candidate diagnostic and therapeutic molecules interact with the proteins.",Studying Aggregation in Neurodegenerative Disease Using Synthetic Proteins,10133161,R01NS103873,"['Adopted', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Amyloid Fibrils', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Binding', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dementia with Lewy Bodies', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Image', 'Invaded', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monitor', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Polymorph', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'abeta accumulation', 'alpha synuclein', 'base', 'crosslink', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging agent', 'in silico', 'in vitro Assay', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'molecular modeling', 'monomer', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'protein aggregation', 'protein misfolding', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'recruit', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'solid state nuclear magnetic resonance', 'synthetic protein', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids', 'uptake']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,359460
"The impact of early Tau pathology on cognitive progression and neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sleep disruption and related daytime dysfunction are common in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD), affecting up to 80% of patients. Despite this known prevalence of sleep-wake disturbance, it is not well understood how dysfunctional sleep-wake rhythms may contribute to cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD Dementia (PDD) and the closely related Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Many of the brain regions involved in regulating daily patterns of sleep-wake behavior are also the earliest to be affected by Lewy Body (LB) pathology, as well as by co-occurring Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, in PD and DLB patients. This Administrative Supplement requests supplemental funding in order to investigate associations between disrupted patterns of sleep-wake behavior, AD co-pathology, and cognitive and neuropsychiatric progression in the context of Lewy body diseases. We will apply novel analysis techniques, such as functional principle component analysis, to newly acquired continuous 24-hour high-resolution actigraphy data to assess patterns of sleep-wake behavior in PD and DLB patients. Uniquely leveraging PET and CSF biomarkers of concomitant tau co-pathology from the parent grant, we will quantify patterns of sleep-wake behavior in patient with pure LB and mixed LB/AD pathologies. The Aims of this study are: (1) to determine associations of disrupted patterns of sleep-wake behavior with cognitive performance and with neuropsychiatric disturbances in PD and DLB., and (2) to relate sleep-wake behavior phenotypes to biomarkers of tau co-pathology (PET and CSF) in PD and DLB. The proposed studies are highly responsive to NOT-NS-21-040 “Administrative Supplements for Collaborative Activities to Promote Sleep/Circadian Research in ADRD” and its stated goal “to facilitate collaborative research to better understand the bi-directional relationship between chronic sleep disturbances/circadian disruption and AD/ADRD pathogenesis”. This supplement also represents a new collaborative effort between sleep researchers (Dr. Jamie Zeitzer) and PD/AD researchers from the parent grant (Drs. Poston and Andreasson), and a provides a unique opportunity to examine the role of sleep-wake rhythms in the progression of cognitive impairment and dementia related to pure LB and to mixed LB/AD pathology in patients with PD and DLB. Project Narrative Parkinson’s disease-related disability is the second fastest increasing cause of death and Disability-Adjusted Life Years in the US, and disability from Parkinson’s disease dementia is a major burden to patients and families. There are only few, limited interventions to treat and none to prevent Parkinson’s disease memory decline and eventual dementia. This study seeks to identify how the early development of Tau pathology could impact cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms in some Parkinson’s disease patients, and thus identify a critical roadblock to effective therapeutic development.",The impact of early Tau pathology on cognitive progression and neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease,10401958,R01NS115114,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Amyloid', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dementia with Lewy Bodies', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lewy Bodies', 'Lewy Body Disease', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Polysomnography', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proxy', 'Psychoses', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Fragmentations', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'circadian', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'disability', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mixed dementia', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'sleep pattern', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutically effective']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,392910
"Towards Generating a Multimodal and Multivariate Classification Model from Imaging and Non-Imaging Measures for Accurate Diagnosis and Monitoring of Dementia in Parkinsons disease. PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the proposed research is to identify the best predictive biomarkers of dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PDD) through a multimodal and multivariate statistical model utilizing both neuroimaging derived measures (diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), and T1-weighted MRI measures) and non- imaging measures such as demographics (age, sex, years of education), clinical (disease duration and severity), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF-measures (Total Tau, β-Amyloid, α-synuclein). It is critical to identify biomarkers that can predict dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PD) as approximately 50-80% of PD patients develop PDD within twelve years of diagnosis. Identifying pathophysiology-based biomarkers that could identify PD patients at high risk for PDD reliably is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and better understanding the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project has two important components. The first component of the project is to understand the pathophysiological mechanism underlying PDD through sophisticated voxelwise dMRI-derived measures estimated using a multi-shell high angular and spatial resolution dMRI data acquisition, and understanding network-level white matter (WM)-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity in PDD. The second component of the project is to identify the biomarkers that predict PDD through multivariate statistical modelling by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures (such as clinical, demographics, genetics, and CSF-measures). We will recruit demographically matched healthy controls (HC) along with demographically, disease duration, and disease severity matched PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), PD-non-MCI (PD-nMCI), and PDD for this project. We will acquire multi-shell dMRI data at three b-values, namely 500s/mm2, 1000s/mm2, and 2500s/mm2 with a high angular and spatial resolution and estimate various unbiased free-water (fiso) corrected Gaussian dMRI-derived measures along with non-Gaussian dMRI-derived measures such as diffusion kurtosis measures, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging measures. We will further compare these measures between the groups to identify significant dMRI-derived measures separating the groups, and understanding the neuroanatomical correlates of these measures with various neuropsychological scores. Furthermore, we will estimate dMRI-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity to understand network-level discrepancies predicting PDD. These pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures will be further combined with various non-imaging measures through a novel machine learning algorithm to identify the comprehensive and best predictors of PDD. The tools developed in our proposal also has great potential for significantly advancing the understanding of other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) thereby helping to understand AD- and PD-specific neuroanatomical changes predicting dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is highly relevant to public health because identification of the Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients at a high-risk for developing dementia (PDD) is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and to better understand the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project identifies the best predictive biomarkers for PDD through examining the comprehensive Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion-MRI (dMRI)-derived white matter (WM) changes predicting PDD, examining the network-level discrepancies predicting PDD derived from dMRI-derived whole-brain structural connectivity and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI)-derived whole-brain functional connectivity, and developing a multivariate and multimodal statistical model by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures such as clinical (disease duration and severity), demographics (age, sex, years of education), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF- measures (β-Amyloid, α-Synuclein, tau) to identify the best predictive biomarkers of PDD through machine learning approach.

"Differential diagnosis of Parkinson's and multiple system atrophy in non-human primate models using a novel a-synuclein retinal contrast agent and AI-assisted analytics Project Summary Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease, and a major cause of disability in individuals over 65 years of age. PD belongs to a spectrum of diseases termed the “synucleinopathies”, defined by the progressive aggregation of insoluble fibrillary a-synuclein, and includes other disorders such as multiple system atrophy and Lewy body dementia. Currently, there are no objective tests that can be used to definitively diagnose PD. In addition, differential diagnosis of synucleinopathies is very challenging and relies heavily on a physician's clinical evaluation. A critical goal in the field is to reliably identify synucleinopathies at early, asymptomatic stages of the disease, to allow the best chance for correct disease modifying or preventative treatments to be effective. This proposal aims to develop a small molecule fluorescent retinal contrast agent as a novel diagnostic for PD and other related synucleinopathies. Project Narrative Parkinson’s disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are age-related synucleinopathies defined by the presence of α-synuclein deposits. Accumulation of α-synuclein has been identified in retina of patients with PD. The proposed research aims to advance the first diagnostic to image α-synuclein deposits in the eye with a novel contrast agent.",Differential diagnosis of Parkinson's and multiple system atrophy in non-human primate models using a novel a-synuclein retinal contrast agent and AI-assisted analytics,10323567,R44NS124473,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age-Years', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'Binding', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cadaver', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Eye', 'Fluorescence', 'Freeze Drying', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kilogram', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Maps', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Preventive treatment', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Toxicology', 'Tracer', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'age related', 'alpha synuclein', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'fluorescence imaging', 'graphical user interface', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'neuropsychiatry', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'phototoxicology', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal imaging', 'small molecule', 'synuclein', 'synucleinopathy', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'translation to humans']",NINDS,"AMYDIS DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R44,2021,2077573
"Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Management in CKD ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, currently affecting >33.5 million adults world- wide. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also highly prevalent and affects 14% of the U.S. and North American population. The burden of AF is 3-fold higher in CKD and affects up to 25% of CKD patients. AF is strongly associated with risk of ischemic stroke and death; and these risks are even higher in patients with CKD. Even in the absence of clinical ischemic stroke, some studies have suggested that AF is also associated with excess risks of all dementia types, including Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia, although definitive evidence is lacking. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by neurodegenerative changes in the brain, including amyloid depositions and neurofibrillary tangles. It is plausible that AF may lead to cerebral microinfarcts, cerebral hemorrhage and reduced cerebral blood flow, all which could promote Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. Gaining a greater understanding of the association of AF with Alzheimer’s and other dementias is particularly important in the CKD population, in whom the incidence and prevalence of dementia is even higher compared with the general population; and in whom the cause of dementia remains elusive and thus largely untreated. Currently, data on the risk of dementia in patients with CKD and AF are limited and may provide new insight into the mechanisms that contribute to dementia in CKD patients. Further, data on whether treatment of AF mitigates risk of dementia are conflicting in all populations (regardless of CKD status). While there are some existing studies of treatment of AF and risk of dementia, most have limitations, including (1) a primary focus on anticoagulation and not a comprehensive evaluation of other AF therapies; (2) inclusion of selected populations and none with CKD; and (3) inadequate consideration of interim clinical measures that may affect receipt and outcomes of AF therapies. Therefore, the effects of successful treatment of AF on risk of dementia remains largely unknown. Further data could identify novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of dementia. We propose to efficiently leverage our unique research platform that includes “real-world” contemporary data to evaluate the risk of dementia in patients with AF, with and without CKD; as well as determine whether successful treatment of AF with a comprehensive range of therapies is linked to a lower risk of dementia. To conduct this work, we will perform a rigorous comparative effectiveness analysis of >500,000 patients with and without AF from two participating health care systems in California. This proposed supplemental project will yield key insights to understanding the link between AF and dementia; particularly in the high-risk population of those with CKD. Furthermore, the anticipated results could form the basis of future randomized clinical trials. NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation is very common, particularly in patients with kidney disease. Studies have suggested that atrial fibrillation may be linked to dementia. In this study, we will evaluate the risk of dementia in patients with concurrent atrial fibrillation and kidney disease; and determine whether successful treatment of atrial fibrillation is linked with lower risk of dementia in this population.",Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Management in CKD,10287433,R01HL142834,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Rate', 'Incidence', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Procedures', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sinus', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'cerebral microinfarct', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness analysis', 'dementia risk', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'insight', 'mortality risk', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'population based', 'response', 'success', 'therapy adverse effect', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,409448
"Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility ABSTRACT The detection, localization and quantification of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) plays an important role in diagnosing and establishing appropriate treatment plans in neurodegenerative diseases specifically in vascular dementia (VaD). To date, evaluating CMBs is time consuming, inaccurate and sometimes not possible. We propose to mitigate these problems by developing our software, “qSPIN”, that will provide fast and easy-to-use methods for: 1) automatic identification of CMBs and veins, 2) automatic quantification of CMBs, 3) automatic quantification of oxygen saturation in veins, and 4) creation of a user-friendly software for the practicing radiologist. Recent developments in MRI have provided a new means by which to study the role of CMBs and venous abnormalities in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), VaD, stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) has proven to be a powerful tool by which to detect CMBs and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can be used to measure changes in oxygen saturation. Knowing how many CMBs there are can predict the onset of VaD, determine whether anti-platelet therapy in stroke should be used, and correlate with neuropsychological outcome for patients with TBI. Our recent version of multi-echo SWI makes it possible to obtain both an arteriogram and a venogram simultaneously. Oxygen saturation can also be used to monitor perfusion changes and extend the window of treatment in stroke.  Currently, most radiologists and technologists do not have time to perform such detailed quantitative processing and thus it is not being done clinically. Our qSPIN software will provide this quantitative data. With the number, size, and location of CMBs or venous abnormalities, a better diagnosis would be possible. Our group is uniquely positioned to address this problem having developed many of these techniques. The novelty of our approach is the marriage of SWI, QSM, STAGE and deep learning techniques to detect these vascular and functional abnormalities. To accomplish the goals of this proposal, we will develop user friendly software that incorporates all imaging information from SWI and QSM to label CMBs. We will also provide the location of the CMBs in Talairach coordinates using a template dataset. In the end, we will have a complete picture of the prevalence of CMBs, abnormal oxygen saturation and their locations in patients with neurodegenerative disease that will improve diagnosis and potentially change their treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a huge demand today for a comprehensive analysis of diseases with cerebral microbleeds, abnormal oxygen saturation and thrombosis such as vascular dementia. The quantification of these features will have major ramifications for the diagnosis and treatment of dementia as well hypertension, stroke and traumatic brain injury all of which can lead to dementia. Therefore, our major objective in this application is to design and develop advanced image processing software that can rapidly and accurately identify and quantify the presence of cerebral microbleeds and changes in oxygen saturation in dementia and related diseases.","Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility",10101667,R44HL145826,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arteriogram', 'Arteriosclerosis', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Businesses', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse Axonal Injury', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Iron', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Published Comment', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stroke', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'base', 'cerebral microbleeds', 'cerebral vein', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurovascular', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'stroke risk', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NHLBI,"MAGNETIC RESONANCE INNOVATIONS, INC.",R44,2021,667050
