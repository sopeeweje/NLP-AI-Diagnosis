"Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence ABSTRACT  Interventions in clinical settings, such as the emergency department (ED), are an opportunity for interpersonal firearm violence prevention, particularly among youth, whom interpersonal firearm violence disproportionately affects. A crucial prerequisite to successful clinical interventions is an accurate gauge of risk, to ensure the judicious allocation of scarce resources; providing that missing prerequisite is the primary goal of the proposed work. Machine learning methods, in contrast to traditional inferential statistical models, are distinguished by their emphasis on prospective prediction, and have enhanced clinical prediction in several fields, including heart disease, cancer diagnosis and outcomes, PTSD, suicide risk, and substance use, among others. Yet, with the exception of the SAFETY score—developed by the current investigative team—machine learning methods have not been leveraged to prospectively predict firearm violence. In this proposed work our research objectives are two-fold: 1) Externally validate the SAFETY score by determining its ability to predict firearm violence involvement within the next year on a new data set; and 2) Improve the SAFETY score by conducting a comparative analysis of four powerful machine learning methods: elastic net penalized logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and boosting (ensemble) methods. In this way, we are responding to Objective One: Research to help inform the development of innovative and promising opportunities to enhance safety and prevent firearm-related injuries, deaths, and crime. This approach is innovative because it builds upon the only work to apply machine learning methods to firearm violence prediction, and it is a promising opportunity to prevent firearm injuries because it will a) provide an explicit gauge of future firearm violence risk; and b) characterize risk factor effects in terms of their prospective prediction ability, unlike any prior research. Thus this research will both identify individuals in most need of intervention, and also point to potentially modifiable predictive factors. Properly addressing this research question in a generalizable way requires a contemporary data set with 1) a focus on a high-need, yet broad, study population; 2) comprehensive baseline measures that provide a broad basis for prediction; and 3) geographic variability (Midwest, West Coast, and East Coast) that enhances generalizability. Thus, we will recruit 1,500 youth age 18-24 from urban EDs in three broadly different locales—Flint, Philadelphia, and Seattle—and administer a baseline survey covering several domains of potential risk factors for future violence, and follow up with those youth at 6- and 12-months to ascertain the primary outcome—firearm violence involvement (as victim or perpetrator)—as well as the secondary outcomes: high-risk firearm behaviors, non-firearm violence, and violent injury. Because this work requires a prospective longitudinal study, we are applying for Option B. This work will lay the ground for future research involving the development and testing of interventions for interpersonal firearm violence both by identifying potential high- leverage modifiable predictive factors, and by identifying youth most in need of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The purpose of the proposed work is to harness cutting-edge machine learning methods to optimize prediction of future firearm violence so that prevention resources can be allocated efficiently. In service to that goal, we will recruit participants age 18-24 from three urban emergency departments, administer a comprehensive assessment, and use the measurements taken there to predict firearm violence over the following year. The proposed work will provide generalizable knowledge on what factors are most predictive of future firearm violence, which will contribute to future intervention strategies both in terms of content and in terms of optimally determining which people require intervention.",Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence,10268933,R01CE003294,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,649996
"Kentucky Occupational Safety and Health Surveillance Program Kentucky (Ky) ranks as the 12th worst state for nonfatal occupational injury rates and the 20th worst for fatal occupational injuries/illnesses. The Ky Occupational Safety and Health Surveillance (KOSHS) expanded program (KOSHS fundamental program, and Fatality Assessment Control and Evaluation [FACE], Occupational Motor Vehicle Injury Surveillance [OMVIS], and Drug-Associated Work-Related Injury Surveil- lance [DAWRIS] expanded projects) focuses on population-based and case-based surveillance of work-related injuries/illnesses in Ky, a southeastern HHS Region 4 state. Specific aims are to: 1) identify and access multi- source KOSHS fundamental program, and FACE, OMVIS, and DAWRIS expanded project surveillance data and evaluate new surveillance data sources for occupational health indicators (OHI); 2) manage and perform quality control and surveillance quality improvement on surveillance data; 3) calculate 20 CSTE/ NIOSH OHIs, 13 Ky-specific OHIs, and Ky employment profile; FACE, OMVIS, and DAWRIS surveillance data; incidence and prevalence rates; and trends; 4) perform case-based surveillance through FACE onsite investigations and high adult blood lead level follow-up investigations; 5) conduct epidemiological analyses of KOSHS fundamen- tal, FACE, OMVIS, and DAWRIS surveillance and investigation data; 6) disseminate public health recommen- dations for workplace interventions and policies using trainings, reports, hazard alerts, publications, etc.; application of communication technologies such as websites, social media, presentations, toolkits, trade journals, and the NIOSH OH clearinghouse; and new and existing partnerships and collaborations with trade associations, state agencies, organizations, and NIOSH, etc. that integrate KOSHS results with partners’ intervention and outreach activities. KOSHS will participate in grantee meetings, and conference calls; and 7) perform a process, impact, and outcome evaluation of the KOSHS fundamental program, and FACE, OMVIS, and DAWRIS expanded projects. Ad hoc KOSHS fundamental program advisory work groups will be estab- lished by priority focus area. Novel KOSHS areas targeted for surveillance and research include worker deaths by suicides; OHIs on work-related injuries using EMS and syndromic surveillance data; drug overdose deaths by industry; light, medium, and heavy vehicle crash OHIs; a recovery-friendly workplace toolkit; dump truck, semi-truck, pedestrian worker, and construction worker fatalities; high commercial vehicle crash locations, rates, ratios, and savings; work-related older driver injuries; OHIs on drug-involved occupational injuries and fatalities after a work-related injury; estimates of drug overdose rates and times based on injury, disability, and loss of work; effect of occupational injuries on subsequent fatal overdose or fatal drug-related work injury and risk profiles; and assessment of drug-involved worker injury risk. Advanced statistical methodologies such as machine learning and probabilistic data linkage will be used. Integration of the KOSHS team with NIOSH and NIOSH-funded programs, Safe Communities, CDC-funded programs, and National Safety Council is planned. The proposed Kentucky Occupational Safety and Health Surveillance (KOSHS) program will 1) identify industries, occupations, and worker populations at high risk for work-related injuries and illnesses; 2) identify risk factors, trends, and emerging issues; 3) identify gaps in, and improve, occupational injury and illness surveillance systems; and 4) develop interventions for the prevention of occupational injuries. When injury prevention knowledge is attained by the worker, injuries on the job and the economic costs of injuries will decrease because there will be fewer workers’ compensation claims. Fewer occupational fatalities will occur and the severity of occupational injuries will be reduced.",Kentucky Occupational Safety and Health Surveillance Program,10319250,U60OH008483,[' '],NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,U60,2021,481000
"Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study PROJECT SUMMARY Road traffic injuries are a major contributor to the burden of disease globally with nearly 1.3 million deaths globally and as many as 50 million injured annually with pedestrians and cyclists in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) among the most affected. Road infrastructure of the built environment (e.g., sidewalks), neighborhood design (e.g., street connectivity) and urban development (e.g., urban sprawl) are key determinants of the risk of pedestrian injuries. In LMICs, poor road infrastructure and neighborhood design are acknowledged as being important contributors to rising numbers of road traffic injuries and deaths, but there are few studies systematically identifying and quantifying what specific features of the built environment are contributing to motor vehicle collisions in these settings. Within LMIC cities, there are often large disparities where infrastructure is improved that reflect socioeconomic characteristics, leading to health inequities in road traffic injury. The paucity of georeferenced data on the built environment in LMICs has made research on road traffic injuries more difficult, though recent advances in computer vision and image analysis combined with Big Data of publicly available, georeferenced, images of roads worldwide (e.g., Google Street View, GSV) can help overcome the paucity of data and the cost and time limitations of collecting and analyzing data on the built environment in LMICs. Automated image analysis has largely been made possible via deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning and relies on training neural networks to detect and label specific objects within images. These methods can drastically reduce the barriers to citywide built environment and traffic safety research in LMIC cities, thus substantially increasing research capacity and generalizability. My career goal is to become an independent investigator in global urban health with a focus on road safety and the built environment in LMICs. I propose undertaking research and training in deep learning methods applied to public health in the setting of Bogota, Colombia: 1) Develop neural networks to create a database of BE features of the road infrastructure from image data and to create neighborhood typologies from those features; 2) Assess the association between neighborhood-level BE features and typologies and pedestrian collisions and fatalities and road safety perceptions; 3) Assess the association of neighborhood social environment characteristics with pedestrian collision and fatalities, perceptions, and BE features and typologies. I am seeking additional training in 1) developing competency in deep learning methods applied to public health; 2) creating neighborhood indictors and typologies of health and the built environment; 3) applying Bayesian spatiotemporal models to understand how neighborhood characteristics and typologies influence health; 4) develop skills in multi-country collaboration, grant writing and overseeing research projects in LMICs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Roads and neighborhoods with a built environment that support safe and active transportation are a major priority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to 90% of road traffic deaths occurring in these locations, especially to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, yet data on key built environment features at a large scale are not always readily available in these settings. My career goal is to improve population health by examining the effects of the built environment and transportation on health through the adoption and use of methods that can leverage Big Data sources and answer complex, multilevel research questions by overcoming the lack of built environment data in LMICs. The proposed research uses deep learning and advanced statistical methods to create a citywide dataset of built and social environment features in Bogota, Colombia that will provide crucial data to answer questions of their impact on pedestrian injuries and deaths, as well as assessing the presence of health inequities in their distribution and that will lay the groundwork to expand these efforts to more cities in Latin America and other LMICs.","Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study",10264065,K01TW011782,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Colombia', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Education', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Latin America', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Typology', 'Urban Developments', 'Urban Health', 'Vehicle crash', 'Writing', 'automated image analysis', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data infrastructure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'neighborhood association', 'neural network', 'pedestrian injury', 'population health', 'skills', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'virtual']",FIC,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,138024

"Enhanced injury surveillance using real-time reporting among healthcare workers Healthcare workers are consistently exposed to hazards with widespread consequences for themselves, patients, and the organization. In a 2018 Bureau of Labor Statistics report, healthcare continues to have one of the highest rates of non-fatal occupational injury relative to other industries. Musculoskeletal injuries, violence, falls, and needle-sticks are most common. It is essential that healthcare systems employ effective and user- friendly surveillance to allocate resources for injury prevention. However, there is extensive evidence that reported injury rates significantly underestimate the true risk, and existing injury surveillance systems do not capture other adverse outcomes that impact health and performance. Other subjective health complains (SHCs), such as stress and fatigue, are major reasons for sickness and absence from work. Furthermore, near-misses have long been integrated into injury surveillance of high-risk industries such as aviation, nuclear power, and the military, but healthcare has yet to systematically assess the incidence of these important sentinel events as part of injury prevention. Finally, despite federal law and institutional policies promoting employee safety, employees are reluctant to report injuries due to time constraints, symptom self-management, peer pressure, perceived `normalcy' of injury, and fear of reprisal. Valid data on the incidence of near-misses, injuries, and time trends are essential for identifying high-risk areas and deploying resources to mitigate harm. This study will address the Healthcare & Social Assistance sector and the cross-sector programs of Musculoskeletal Health and Healthy Work Design & Well-Being by addressing the weaknesses in current injury surveillance methods using a proactive approach. Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare injury surveillance systems and significantly reduce work-related injuries. Our specific aims are to: integrate passive injury reporting with active injury reporting to improve detection of worker harm; leverage unit-based risk metrics, passive and active injury reports to continuously monitor the work environment; and develop an early-warning system that will more accurately trigger interventions to decrease the risk of and prevent worker injuries. Randomly selected patient care providers will verbally record injuries, near-misses, and SHCs on a mobile application for 800 two-week periods. Using advanced statistical methods (e.g. machine learning) and data visualization we will aggregate injury data and unit-based metrics to produce an injury risk identification and prediction model; develop a digital heat map to identify high-risk units in near real-time, in a real-world setting, and provide hospital leaders with notifications with established risk-specific mitigation strategies. We build upon our R21OH010035 project, which established the feasibility of active injury surveillance and documented its superiority to current surveillance practice. In response to PAR-18-812, our project can shift current practice toward a more rigorous integration of injury surveillance and prevention. NARRATIVE Current ways of collecting employee injuries greatly underestimate the true numbers and risk involved. Our work will improve upon current methods by actively reaching out to healthcare workers to report physical injuries, near-misses, and other health effects by means of a user-friendly mobile application. We will also design a system that will combine information from employee injuries with risk factors from the patient care environment to provide early warnings about high risk areas – leading to improving the health and safety of healthcare workers and can be applied to other industries interested in improving worker safety.",Enhanced injury surveillance using real-time reporting among healthcare workers,10210538,R01OH011996,[' '],NIOSH,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,636000
"Harnessing Data Science to Promote Equity in Injury and Surgery for Africa PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Trauma and other surgically treated conditions are a crippling, unaddressed burden of disease that disproportionately impacts sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) globally. The Data Science Center for the Study of Surgery, Injury, and Equity in Africa (D-SINE-Africa) is a strategic partnership between the University of Buea (Buea), the University of California (Los Angeles (UCLA) and Berkeley), the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health, the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Cameroon, and the University of Cape Town in South Africa. D-SINE Africa will address the intersection of health disparities with the risk factors and outcomes associated with injury and surgical disease in SSA. Although more abundant than ever, data is still a limited resource in low- and middle-income countries. Our approach views “big data” available in SSA as an opportunity to develop sustainable data-constrained approaches appropriate for resource-constrained settings. Thus, data science will be harnessed to address our Hub's two main goals which are;1) to decrease the burden of injuries and surgical diseases through improved surveillance, prevention, and treatment; and 2) to improve access to quality surgical care in Cameroon and other SSA countries. These goals will be achieved through three specific aims: 1) Research 2) Networking and 3) Capacity Building. These aims implemented through three cores (Administrative, Data Management and Analysis, and Capacity Building Cores) and two Research Projects that will be conducted in Cameroon, South Africa, and Uganda. Research Project 1 - Health Equity Surveillance addresses the urgent gap in rapid socioeconomic (SES) estimation necessary to track health equity in acute care settings by applying a clustering algorithm to existing publicly available Demographic and Health Surveys data sets for SSA. Research Project 2 – Trauma Follow Up Prediction aims to improve trauma outcomes by using machine learning to optimize a mobile phone-based screening survey that will identify which trauma patients would benefit from further care after they are discharged from the hospital, again using a data reduction “big data to small data” approach in line with the Hub's commitment to sustainable data use practices. These projects utilize common data sources (Cameroon Trauma Registry), have harmonizing themes (injury, equity, and data reduction), and will yield findings that can be used together (e.g., identification of SES groups vulnerable to poor follow up care). The Hub has innovatively built community engagement vehicles into the Internal Advisory Board to promote a multi-faceted approach to building trust with research participants and end-users. D-SINE Africa efforts will drive innovation and impact in data science, injury, and equity research to improve access to surgical disease prevention and care, including those whose SES conspires to increase their vulnerability to injury and surgical conditions while reducing consistent surgical care access. D-SINE Africa's strategic partners joint infrastructure are available for use by its members and DSI-Africa consortium at large. PROJECT NARRATIVE Injuries and other surgically treated diseases comprise a significant burden of disease in Cameroon and other sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries with deep inequities that are particularly unmasked in acute care settings. D-SINE Africa Hub will focus on the intersection between injury and equity, leveraging data science to decrease the impact of trauma, surgical disease, and disparities on the population of Cameroon and SSA by promoting collaborative research, networking, and capacity building with an emphasis on equity.",Harnessing Data Science to Promote Equity in Injury and Surgery for Africa,10314099,U54TW012087,"['Address', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Cameroon', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Congo', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic and Health Surveys', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Emergency Situation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospital Referrals', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Improve Access', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Office of Administrative Management', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Seeds', 'Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Trust', 'Uganda', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'acute care', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'community engagement', 'data management', 'data quality', 'data reduction', 'disease disparity', 'disorder prevention', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'health equity', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'injury burden', 'innovation', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mathematical sciences', 'meetings', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'prevention service', 'programs', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment services', 'uptake']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF BUEA,U54,2021,1079277
"Strengthening the Quantitative Pipeline for Multidisciplinary Trauma Research in Cameroon PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Trauma is a leading cause of death and disability in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), particularly in Cameroon, where a higher burden of injury is reported compared to similar settings in the region. Injury research focused on prevention and improvements in trauma care, such as trauma Quality improvement (QI), have led to significant reductions in the burden of injury in high-income countries. Yet, there remain critical gaps in the current trauma research infrastructure in SSA due to limited training opportunities. The Sustainable Trauma Research, Education, and Mentorship Program (STREaM) will seek to fill this gap, building on an existing long-term partnership between the University of California and the University of Buea (Buea) to provide innovative training to Cameroonian post-graduate candidates with a focus on novel, cutting edge quantitative tools. STREaM Cameroon program will aspire to establish a cadre of graduate trainees with multidisciplinary expertise in Injury prevention and control, quality improvement, and quantitative methods that can address limitations posed by the time-dependent, dynamic, and incomplete nature of trauma-related data. The program will leverage recent advances in research methodologies, such as machine learning and implementation science, that are particularly suited to trauma research. STREaM Cameroon aims to accomplish the following objectives:1) Train a critical mass of multidisciplinary scientists in trauma research through MPH, PhD, and post-doctoral pathways who will form the foundation for an Injury Center at the Buea; 2) Develop and implement a combination of short, medium, and long-term quantitative and trauma research curricula co-taught by U.S. and Cameroonian faculty to sustainably strengthen existing offerings at the Buea; 3) Provide mentored research opportunities for trainees to apply quantitative skills to trauma QI projects utilizing the partnership’s existing research and data collection infrastructure in Cameroon; and 4) Integrate trainee scholars into a robust scientific network through existing international organizations and the creation of a Cameroonian Trauma Network to serve as an ongoing community of practice. During the five-year program, a total of 2 post docs, and eight PhD and Master’s level students per year will be trained using a team mentoring approach. Master’s and PhD students will take part in online courses throughout their training, administered through the University of California Berkeley and University of California San Francisco’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute. All students will participate in mentored research. Additionally, post-docs will spend one semester at Berkeley receiving in-person training to prepare them for faculty positions at Buea. Upon completion of the STReaM program, graduates will successfully engage in innovative, evidence-based research to improve the quality of trauma care and reduce the burden of injury among vulnerable populations in SSA. STReaM Cameroon graduates will thus be trained and equipped to mentor the next generation of scientists in trauma research, playing a critical role in influencing healthcare practices and policy locally and internationally. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the significant burden and predicted future growth of trauma as a public health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there remains a gap in trauma research training and distinct limitations in quantitative offerings at institutions of higher education in the region. The proposed Sustainable Trauma Research and Mentorship (STREaM) program will train a cadre of multidisciplinary trainees at three educational levels (MPH, PhD, and post-doctoral) to create a critical mass of trauma researchers in Cameroon with knowledge of novel, cutting edge quantitative methodologies.

"Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics ABSTRACT Neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) have been historically categorized into discrete ""types"" based on structure, physiological responses, connectivity patterns, and molecular profiles. Heterogeneity can have other consequences- e.g. recent studies have found that some neuronal types in the retina are more resilient than other types to optic nerve injury, an event that leads to irrecoverable damage in vision. My project combines cutting-edge single-cell genomic technologies, advanced computational data analysis and molecular tools to define heterogeneity of neuronal types comprehensively, to connect molecular definitions to histology, and explore the functional consequences of this heterogeneity during nerve injury. I will focus on a tractable system, the mouse retina, which communicates visual responses to the brain. It is as complex as any other region of the brain (containing ~120 neuronal types), but benefits from having a compact, accessible structure, and experimental tools make it especially suited for detailed analyses. Building on my previous postdoctoral work, this project will, 1) Complete the census of the mouse retina, which will the first for any CNS region, by inferring molecular taxonomies of two of its most heterogenous classes (amacrines and ganglion cells) from data collected using high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using the mouse census, initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, which is harder to access experimentally, but shares important features with humans that are absent in mice. 2) Conduct a systematic investigation of cell-type specific responses in the retina to optic nerve injury. This usually leads to a rapid, stereotypic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but a recent study by my colleagues reported that some RGC types are more resilient than others. Here, using 1) as a resource, I will identify factors, cell intrinsic and extrinsic, that make these RGC types resilient. 3) Selective resilience of cell types is now recognized as a feature of diseases like glaucoma and stroke. Therapies therefore need to cater to different cell types. To learn more, and derive general principles, I will examine the impact of known therapeutic interventions on the survival of different RGC types, and the underlying molecular responses, within the optic nerve injury model. Taken together, my project will derive substantial molecular information underlying neuronal heterogeneity in the mouse and macaque retina and general principles for cell-type selective resilience following CNS injury in mice. The lessons from this work will provide valuable guidance for similar studies in less accessible regions of the brain (e.g. cerebral cortex).   NARRATIVE The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of a large diversity of neuronal types, a major proportion of which remain to be identified and defined in terms of molecular markers so that their roles in function and dysfunction can be assessed. This project seeks to combine high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics, innovative computational and histological methods to comprehensively define neuronal heterogeneity in an accessible system – the mouse retina, and use this as a foundation to (1) initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, and (2) study cell-type specific responses in a tractable model of nerve injury (optic nerve crush) to map the resilience of different cell types, and identify molecular correlates underlying these differences. Our work will create transformational tools to address similar challenges in other CNS regions.","Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics",10132331,R00EY028625,"['Address', 'Amacrine Cells', 'Animal Model', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cessation of life', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Crush', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Injuries', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'central nervous system injury', 'design', 'ganglion cell', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'injury recovery', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'molecular marker', 'nerve injury', 'neuroprotection', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'retinal ganglion cell regeneration', 'retinal neuron', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stroke-like episode', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R00,2021,241530
"Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma Project Summary Glaucoma damage to the optic nerve and impairment of vision are progressive and irreversible. Understanding mechanisms of glaucomatous injury will help to develop new approaches for treatments that can be used along with traditional therapies that lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Recent developments in optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography have brought increased attention to the role of the inner retinal circulation in glaucoma. To improve our understanding of retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma, we can take advantage of recent developments in visible-light OCT (vis-OCT) to characterize simultaneously tissue structure, vessel density, blood flow and oxygenation. The goal of this project is to further advance vis-OCT by attaining capillary-level measurements, test the value of measuring their local alterations as early indicators of glaucoma and glaucomatous progression and use this to evaluate impaired retinal autoregulation from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss as a potential cause of increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop high-speed, high-sensitivity, high-resolution vis-OCT. The speed will be double that of the current system. A more stable supercontinuum laser will be used to improve system sensitivity, and a tighter focus will be used to improve lateral resolution. This will enable complete detection of capillaries that may be vulnerable to vascular dysfunction. Specific Aim 2 will develop quantitative OCT angiography, velocimetry and oximetry in capillaries as well as arteries and veins. Building on the high-resolution, high-contrast scans acquired in Aim 1, we will use machine learning to segment capillary plexuses, and advanced image processing to extract capillary architecture. Aided by this capillary architecture, we will automatically measure blood flow and oxygenation in capillary segments and incorporate them into a real-time platform. Specific Aim 3 will use this system to demonstrate that acute loss of RGCs, produced by optic nerve transection, alters retinal capillary plexus density, oximetry and velocimetry over time and that these changes precede altered oximetry and flow in larger retinal vessels. We will also show that loss of RGCs impairs the autoregulatory response to acute IOP challenge. In Specific Aim 4, we will demonstrate that optic nerve injury in a model of controlled, elevated IOP produces early alterations in capillary velocimetry, oximetry and autoregulation, show that they are more persistent with advanced injury, and demonstrate the pathophysiologic consequences of these observations. Successful development of this new technology will improve methods of early glaucoma diagnosis and detection of progression. Better understanding of retinal vascular factors that lead to increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma will lead to improved treatments for these highly vulnerable patients. Project Narrative This project will develop advanced technology to image retinal capillaries and measure capillary blood flow and oxygen content. This may provide an early indicator of glaucoma progression and help study a potential cause of increased susceptibility to intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients.","Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma",10232055,R01EY031394,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abbreviations', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Axon', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Computer software', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intraocular pressure test', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Injuries', 'Optic Nerve Transections', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Structure of central vein of the retina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Veins', 'Velocimetries', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'attenuation', 'automated segmentation', 'central retinal artery', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'density', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabolic rate', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'prototype', 'response', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'retina circulation', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal ischemia', 'traditional therapy', 'vascular factor']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,500718
"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,10092137,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'empowered', 'first responder', 'health goals', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'prescription monitoring program', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,460884
"Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to characterize biomarkers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in heavy users. Marijuana and tobacco smoking are both prevalent among HIV+ populations, but their individual and combined impacts on inflammation and cardiovascular risk are unknown. Preliminary studies using longitudinal data from a prospective cohort showed that chronic heavy marijuana smoking has no significant effect on HIV disease markers, but is associated with increased rates of incident cardiovascular events in ART-treated HIV+ men age 40-60 independently of tobacco smoking and traditional risk factors. Furthermore, we showed that heavy marijuana and/or tobacco smoking was associated with elevated WBC and neutrophil counts, immune activation, inflammation, and vascular injury in ART-treated HIV+ smokers. We hypothesize that specific combustion products in marijuana and tobacco smoke, including acrolein, other reactive aldehydes, and VOCs, can induce proinflammatory responses mediated through activated neutrophils and monocytes that promote chronic inflammation in ART-treated adults, contributing to cardiovascular risk by promoting lipid peroxidation, coagulation, vascular inflammation, and endothelial injury, while attenuating protective responses. We further hypothesize that these effects are additive upon dual exposure to both marijuana and tobacco smoke and augmented by HIV infection. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well- characterized longitudinal HIV+ cohorts to characterize marijuana smoke exposure biomarkers in plasma and urine samples and their relationship to inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models to explain the effects of specific constituents of marijuana smoke on inflammatory pathways, and how these pathways are modified in the setting of HIV infection. These studies will provide information that helps to explain chronic inflammation and elevated cardiovascular risk in ART-treated HIV+ adults, safety profiles of smoked cannabinoids, and potential strategies for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to characterize markers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in chronic heavy users. These studies will elucidate mechanisms by which smoked marijuana can impact inflammation and health outcomes in HIV+ individuals, and provide new information related to safety profiles of cannabinoids and development of therapeutic interventions.",Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection,10107795,R01DA046203,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Acrolein', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aldehydes', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Antioxidants', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coagulation Process', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Endothelium', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Immunologic Markers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Toxic effect', 'Urine', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'combustion product', 'comorbidity', 'immune activation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'marijuana smoke', 'marijuana use', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'monocyte', 'network models', 'neutrophil', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tobacco exposure', 'tobacco smoke exposure', 'transcriptome', 'vascular inflammation', 'vascular injury', 'volatile organic compound']",NIDA,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,648591
"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"Biomechanical and Biological Predictors of Cartilage Health Following Meniscus Injury Abstract  Injury of the meniscus is frequently associated with early onset osteoarthritis (OA). Partial meniscectomy to remove the damaged meniscal tissue is the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedure. While this procedure can provide symptomatic relief in the short term, nearly 35% of patients develop radiographic evidence of OA within 5-7 years following surgery. However, the causes for this early onset OA are unknown. One potential pathway for the progression of knee OA following meniscectomy is through altered loading of the articular cartilage. However, other studies suggest that biological factors, such as joint inflammation may play an important role. Recently, through a combination of MR imaging, 3D modeling, and biplanar radiography, our team has shown that medial meniscal injury alters the cartilage-to-cartilage contact strains in both the medial and lateral compartments. In addition, we found that increased strain was correlated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in the synovial fluid, a biomarker which may be indicative of joint degradation. Together, these results suggest that biomechanical and biological factors play an important role in the development of OA after meniscal injury. However, the role of partial meniscectomy on these changes is unclear. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the biomechanical and biological environment of the joint before and after partial meniscectomy will elucidate the factors that contribute to early onset OA. Our overall hypothesis is that following partial meniscectomy, both biomechanical and biological changes in the joint will predict cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, when biomechanical and biological predictors are combined together with patient demographics and clinical characteristics, we will identify well-defined clinical phenotypes of patients at high risk of cartilage degeneration.  Cartilage degeneration will be assessed through MR-based measures of cartilage thickness and composition. Using high speed biplanar x-ray and MR imaging, in vivo cartilage strains in both knees of patients with unilateral medial meniscus injury will be measured in response to treadmill walking prior to surgery and after surgery. Synovial fluid and serum will also be collected and a panel of pro-inflammatory mediators and tissue metabolic biomarkers will be measured. Synovial fluid immune cell analyses will be performed by flow cytometry. Using these biomechanical and biological factors, we will identify participants at increased risk for cartilage degeneration at two years after surgery. Then, using predictive models combining biomechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics, we will develop well-defined clinical phenotypes of cartilage degeneration risk. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focused on surgery, pharmaceutical targets, and non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical rehabilitation strategies or weight loss, to prevent cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Meniscus injuries are very common and frequently lead to early onset osteoarthritis, a leading cause of disability.

"Resting State Connectivity in Primate Spinal Cord ABSTRACT / SUMMARY  This proposal aims to continue our research to identify and characterize resting state functional MRI signals within the grey matter of the spinal cord, and to validate the interpretation of resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) networks in the spine that appear to reflect specific, behaviorally-relevant functions. In the current funding period we have found resting state networks within the cord exhibit more complex connectivity than previously reported, both within and across segments, including significant correlations with the intermediate region and grey commissure that are relevant for autonomic functions and left-right coordination. Importantly, by implementing a dorsal column injury to the cervical spine in a non-human primate, we have confirmed that the strengths of connectivity within these networks are in general related to functional performance, and changes in the networks correspond to behavioral changes in, for example, skilled hand use. We next aim to fully characterize the sub-components of rsFC and relate them to more specific functions. We will acquire sub-millimeter, multi-parametric MR images at high field (9.4T) in squirrel monkeys and address three main aims. (1) We will identify and differentiate rsFC networks within spinal cord using selective lesions and pharmacological interventions to determine which components and network connectivities are affected by specific disruptions of normal sensory or motor pathways. We will isolate circuits affected by (a) reversible block of motor or sensory inputs with pharmacological agents; (b) permanently ablating the drive of motor neurons from primary motor cortex in ventral horn; and (c) disrupting sensory signals to dorsal horn neurons by sectioning dorsal spinal nerve roots. We will follow the evolution of each injury using CEST and DTI to measure the extent and severity of the injury, and DTI and qMT to validate injury severity and quantify changes in axonal integrity and myelination. (2) We will validate the rsFC measures from MRI by comparisons with electrophysiology, micro-stimulation and tract-tracing histology. We will (a) directly stimulate specific nodes while monitoring down-stream activity with electrophysiology and fMRI; (b) perform longitudinal fMRI and microarray recordings of electrical coherences in each monkey subjected to specific interventions (Aim 1); and (c) determine whether regions which appear to be functionally connected by fMRI also show strong anatomical connections by injecting tracers and performing histological assessments post mortem. (3) We will determine the functional and behavioral relevance of rsFC by disrupting each circuit, identifying corresponding changes in rsFC, and relating these changes to performance of skilled hand sensorimotor behavior. By the completion of the study, we will validate rsFC measurements as indicators of spinal cord functions, and establish the fine- grained intrinsic architecture of intra-spinal circuits. These studies will provide new information on the neural organization of the spinal cord, validate the interpretation of BOLD measurements of connectivity, and provide a roadmap for the use of fMRI for studying human spinal cord functions. Narrative The studies proposed will identify and differentiate neural networks within the grey matter of the spinal cord that subserve different functions and which may be detected using functional MRI. The patterns of connections between different sub-regions of the cord will be quantified before and after targeted interventions that are intended to disrupt specific functions. The interpretation of functional MRI measurements will be validated using electrophysiology and post-mortem histology.",Resting State Connectivity in Primate Spinal Cord,10209997,R01NS092961,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Cervical spine', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grain', 'Gray Commissure', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Home', 'Horns', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor Pathways', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Posterior Horn Cells', 'Primates', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Saimiri', 'Seeds', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Lesions', 'Spinal Dorsal Nerve', 'Spinal cord grey matter structure', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal nerve root structure', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'deep learning', 'dorsal column', 'grasp', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'microstimulation', 'myelination', 'neural network', 'nonhuman primate', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'treatment effect']",NINDS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,562560
"Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury Abstract  My career and research interests have centered on the science of movement and factors that maximize mobility. Whether this is through injury prevention, assistive technology, or biomechanical optimization, it is critical to clinical practice that these processes be well understood so that we can provide the most informed patient treatments. In order to carry out more effective clinically-based studies that inform patient care, it is my desire to continue my training through practical experiences with both formal coursework and a oversight by a strong mentoring team in the following domains: (1) activity-based data collection and analysis and (2) use of advanced statistical methods to investigate multiple factors. Through the K23, I will also gain experience specifically focused on my transition to independence; this will include grantsmanship and lab management, leading the design and implementation of clinical and translational studies, management of personnel and meetings, and pursuit of tenure and an R01. This continued training will be completed in the context of a research study that characterizes activity patterns in functional mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI).  Aim 1 of this study is to predict mobility at discharge and at 1-year post-discharge, based upon patient characteristics and activity during IPR. Mobility outcomes can be challenging to predict, particularly for individuals with moderate strength and sensory impairments. Selecting appropriate training is increasingly important with shrinking lengths of stay and there are potential opportunity costs and adverse consequences on quality of life and participation for individuals who do not receive appropriate interventions. Additional activity measures that we can collect early in the IPR stay, by utilizing low-cost sensors, have the potential to provide rich data sets that we can examine to garner insight into outcomes with little administrative burden. Using a machine learning approach, we will investigate patient characteristics and activity-monitoring data to improve predictive models of patient mobility based on data acquired early in the rehab stay. Achieving these aims will improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI to appropriately target expectations and interventions to maximize functional outcomes.  Aim 2 of this proposal is to quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes (i.e., wheeling walking or changes in activity within mode) in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation. There are factors following discharge that challenge or enhance the sustainability of walking for functional mobility including energy costs, neurologic recovery and biopsychosocial factors such as resilience, self-efficacy, environment, and caregiver support. The association between these factors and post-discharge changes in mobility are not well understood. Using wearable sensors we will quantify time spent walking and wheeling to identify transitions between walking and wheeling, identify factors that contribute to these transitions and investigate their impact on participation. Project Narrative In the context of steadily decreasing lengths of stay for inpatient rehabilitation, and in conjunction with therapy caps in outpatient therapy settings that have led to an overall decrease in patient time spent within a clinical context, it is becoming ever more critical that rehabilitation interventions appropriately target functional mobility (walking or wheeling). Unfortunately, the needed data on how mobility changes following discharge and those factors that most accurately predict patient outcomes is lacking. This proposal seeks to improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI so that expectations and interventions can be appropriately targeted to maximize functional outcomes through the following aims: (1) predict mobility at 1 year post-discharge based on patient characteristics, biopyschosocial factors, and activity during inpatient rehabilitation and (2) quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation.",Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury,10246175,K23HD096134,"['Address', 'Biomechanics', 'Caregiver support', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Coin', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exertion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinesiology', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personnel Management', 'Physical activity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Secondary to', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'biopsychosocial factor', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'community setting', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'gait rehabilitation', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'injury prevention', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'muscle strength', 'neurological recovery', 'opportunity cost', 'patient mobility', 'person centered', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'research study', 'resilience', 'sensor', 'translational study', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2021,127999
"Monitoring Lower Limb Movement to Predict Ambulatory Ability after Spinal Cord Injury After a spinal cord injury (SCI), clinicians must quickly decide where to focus therapy time to maximize an individual's functional mobility by discharge: either towards gait training or wheeled mobility interventions. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) can assist clinicians in making those difficult decisions, but literature has shown that for individuals with moderate impairments, current CPRs that use age, strength, and sensation are not sufficient in predicting independent ambulation. Further, existing CPRs do not provide insight into clinically important descriptive measures of gait quality, efficiency, and endurance that contribute to functional ambulation. Our recent work demonstrated individuals who received gait training, but primarily used a wheelchair one year after SCI received less transfer and wheeled mobility training and had lower measures of participation than non-ambulatory individuals who never received gait training. In the context of decreasing inpatient rehabilitation length of stays, it is crucial that time in therapy be used efficiently to maximize function at discharge and avoid those long-term consequences.  Lower limb movement (LLM) captured using activity monitors may provide a more sensitive measure of strength and sensation than traditional methods such as manual muscle and light touch sensation testing. This technique is novel in that LLM has not yet been reported in literature for individuals with SCI. Our preliminary analysis has shown promise for the association between LLM, strength, and ambulatory ability (as defined by measures of gait quality, efficiency, and endurance). Using machine learning techniques, we are able to determine which factors have the strongest association with ambulatory ability, among LLM, subject demographics, clinical characteristics, and other covariates.  Our long-term goal is to improve CPRs that predict ambulation after SCI, thus enabling appropriately targeted functional mobility training. As a first step towards this goal, we will build a foundational knowledge of LLM and its relationship as a potential biomarker for ambulatory ability cross-sectionally among individuals with chronic SCI and known, diverse functional abilities (Aim 1). We will also explore longitudinal LLM data and ambulatory ability for a population with acute SCI (Aim 2) to evaluate changes in LLM over time and create a preliminary prediction model.  Achieving the proposed aims will provide new insights into factors that predict mobility in individuals with SCI and provide understanding as to how these factors change acutely following injury. Further, we will gain insight to guide a future multisite longitudinal study that will assess a new, more effective CPR. This CPR will aid clinical decision-making for individuals with SCI by allowing for optimally targeted therapies to be employed throughout the rehabilitation continuum, thus improving long-term functional outcomes. Project Narrative Current rules are not sufficient in predicting ambulation among individuals with moderate strength and sensory deficits after a spinal cord injury, and this can lead to an inefficient use of therapy time. By measuring actual lower limb movement using activity monitors, we believe we can capture an unexplained variance missing from current prediction models that use traditional clinical measures to more accurately predict ambulatory ability. Accomplishing the goals outlined in this proposal will provide clinicians with a better understanding of ambulatory prognosis after spinal cord injury and will allow for optimal target therapies to be employed throughout the rehabilitation continuum to maximize functional outcomes and quality of life.",Monitoring Lower Limb Movement to Predict Ambulatory Ability after Spinal Cord Injury,10049966,F30HD096828,"['Accounting', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Caffeine', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Community Participation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Home', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'functional outcomes', 'gait rehabilitation', 'improved', 'independent ambulation', 'indexing', 'insight', 'limb movement', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'spasticity', 'targeted treatment']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F30,2021,39636
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury. PROJECT SUMMARY Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus, we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure. Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI’s effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro. We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48’s five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.

"Evaluating associations between trauma-related characteristics and functional recovery in individuals with spinal cord injury Project Summary World Health Organization established that every year, around the world, between 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI). While existing research suggests links between the injury event, early care, and rehabilitation outcomes, there still remains a critical knowledge gap – about how characteristics associated with trauma and acute phases of SCI can allow us to better understand functional recovery post- SCI. In the past, this research was partly hampered due to databases that either focused on trauma-care or inpatient rehabilitation. However, using advanced analytical methods, we are now in a position to combine databases that contain trauma and acute phase-related variables with patient-level characteristics to assess longitudinal functional recovery over time. Trauma and acute phase-related variables include type of trauma, cause of injury, process of care, clinical data, and outcome data during acute care. The overall objective of this study is to use trauma and acute phase-related variables to explain the longitudinal functional recovery of individuals with SCI, from acute to post-acute to community. This will be achieved by probabilistically linking the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Outcomes Study (PTOS) database with the National Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems (SCIMS) database. The PTOS and SCIMS databases provide complimentary information about trauma and acute phases of SCI from acute hospital to inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) to community. The long-term goal of our research is to identify trauma and acute phase-related variables that can be utilized during acute care and post-acute rehabilitation interventions to improve clinical decision making, which in turn enhances rehabilitation programs.The central hypothesis of this proposal is that trauma and acute phase- related variables, combined with patient-level characteristics, will significantly predict longitudinal functional recovery in individuals post-SCI. Our hypothesis is guided by prior research and our pilot work with the PTOS database. A primary objective of this proposal is to examine the association between trauma and acute phase- related variables with functional improvements during IRF in individuals with traumatic SCI using machine learning ensemble methods (Aim 1). A secondary objective of this study is to develop longitudinal trajectories of functional recovery over a period of 1-year post-SCI taking into account trauma, acute phase, and patient- level characteristics during acute, post-acute, and community living using growth curve modelling (Aim 2). The proposed study will yield novel insights about the relationship between trauma and acute phase-related variables with functional status. Project Narrative World Health Organization has reported that every year, around the world, between 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI).

"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,10062524,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,553209
"FAIR VISION for TOP-NT PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types.

"Risk prediction and optimizing outcomes to 1-year after firearm injury among children using emergency services in the US Proposed Approach: We will build three national cohorts of children requiring emergency services over a 10-year period to evaluate primary, secondary, and tertiary firearm injury prevention. We will use existing research infrastructure, data science methods, the ability to track children to one year, novel analytics, and an interdisciplinary team to address this critical public health need. Importance: Injury remains the leading cause of death in children, with firearms resulting in the highest mortality, surgical intervention, critical care, and cost compared to all other mechanisms of injury. However, there are many challenges to firearm injury prevention in children. Risk prediction tools are sparse, firearm injury recidivism and death are concerns among children who initially survive such an injury, and processes of care to optimize survival are under-investigated. There is a compelling need for research in these areas to facilitate targeted interventions to reduce firearm injury and mortality among at-risk children. Objectives: The proposal has 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Using three national cohorts of children 0 to 17 years requiring emergency services, employ machine learning and geospatial analysis to develop and validate risk prediction models for firearm injury and short-term mortality using individual-, home-, incident-, and county-level factors. Specific Aim 2. Among children discharged alive following a firearm injury, measure injury recidivism, healthcare utilization, and mortality to 1-year and develop risk prediction models to identify children at-risk of adverse outcomes in the year after an index firearm event. Specific Aim 3: For children presenting to an ED after a firearm injury, identify ED and hospital characteristics independently associated with in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year survival, and quantify the additional lives saved through feasible shifts in the location of initial emergency care. Study Design & Setting: We will build 3 cohorts of children using emergency services from 1/1/2012 to 12/31/2021 in 1,217 EDs in 8 states (ED cohort), 832 trauma centers in 50 states (Trauma Center cohort), and 5,461 EMS agencies in 28 states (EMS cohort). We will link six different data sources to the cohorts to capture longitudinal outcomes and 110 predictor variables at the patient-, incident-, home-, and county-level. Participants: Children 0–17 years using emergency services, including: 40.9 million in the ED cohort (n = 35,240 with firearm injuries), 620,007 in the Trauma Center cohort (n = 22,847 with firearm injuries), and 6.8 million in the EMS cohort (n = 14,314 with firearm injuries). Outcome measures: We will evaluate models for firearm injury, adverse events to 1-year among children initially surviving a firearm injury, and short- and long-term survival following a firearm injury. Project Narrative Reducing firearm injuries and related mortality in children is a critical public health priority. We will build three unique national cohorts of children injured by firearms and served by different aspects of the US emergency care system (emergency medical services, emergency departments, and trauma centers). Using these cohorts, novel analytic methods, and predictors at the patient-, home-, incident-, and county-levels, we will develop risk prediction models to: identify children at risk of firearm injuries (primary injury prevention); children at risk of adverse outcomes to one year after initially surviving a firearm injury (secondary injury prevention); and ED and hospital factors associated with optimal survival after firearm injury (tertiary injury prevention).",Risk prediction and optimizing outcomes to 1-year after firearm injury among children using emergency services in the US,10399358,R01HD108017,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accidental Injury', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Injury', 'Consensus', 'County', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Event', 'Firearms', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Gun injury', 'Health', 'Home', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Health Policy', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention Research', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Survivors', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'child services', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'emergency settings', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'injured', 'injury prevention', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neglect', 'novel', 'pediatric department', 'preventable death', 'public health priorities', 'recidivism', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'tool', 'trauma centers']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1991980
"Hippocampal arteriole remodeling and brain injury in preeclampsia and eclampsia Preeclampsia (PE) is a common hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that causes significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The consequences of PE extend far beyond pregnancy and are associated with excessive cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease risk later in life, including a 9-fold increased risk of dying from myocardial infarction and a 4- to 5-fold increased risk of stroke. PE women also have high seizure susceptibility (called eclampsia) that causes considerable morbidity and mortality both during seizure and later in life. Importantly, former PE and eclamptic women (seizure in a PE woman) have poorer cognition and brain atrophy later in life, with increased white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that positively correlate with cognitive defects and decline. The effect of PE and eclampsia on memory and cognition suggests the hippocampus is adversely affected, a brain region that has a critical role in consolidation of long- and short-term memory and spatial navigation. Our previous studies found that hippocampal arterioles (HAs), small brain arterioles that perfuse the hippocampus, were smaller and stiffer in a model of experimental PE (ePE) than HAs from normal late-pregnant animals that was associated with mild cognitive impairment. In addition, ePE animals lacked a hyperemic response to seizure that was associated with greater neuronal injury. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate vascular mechanisms of hippocampal injury and cognitive impairment during PE and eclampsia. The overall hypothesis of this application is that HA remodeling and increased stiffness during ePE causes hippocampal injury that promotes cognitive impairment. We will therefore investigate mechanisms by which HA remodeling and increased stiffness occurs in ePE and if preventing the vascular changes will prevent cognitive impairment (Aim 1). We will also determine the effect of prolonged and recurrent seizure on hippocampal injury and if preventing HA remodeling will prevent injury during seizure (Aim 2). And lastly, we will determine if the vascular and cognitive changes persist long-term (months postpartum) in ePE rats (Aim 3). The proposed studies will provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which cognitive impairment occurs in women with PE and how seizure adversely affects the maternal brain. The potential outcome of this project is identifying new therapeutic targets and strategies for preventing and/or treating hippocampal injury in women with PE and eclampsia that could improve the lives of women with this condition. This project will provide a greater understanding of how preeclampsia and eclampsia adversely affect the maternal brain to cause cognitive impairment. The focus on vascular structure and function of deep brain regions, such as the hippocampus that is critical to memory and cognition, as a therapeutic target provides a unique opportunity to treat this condition during pregnancy and its long-term consequences later in life.",Hippocampal arteriole remodeling and brain injury in preeclampsia and eclampsia,10163278,R01NS108455,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Arteries', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Development', 'Eclampsia', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactivity', 'Hyperemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Microcirculation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vascular resistance', 'Woman', 'arteriole', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive testing', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'excitotoxicity', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'ischemic injury', 'long short term memory', 'long term memory', 'maternal morbidity', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morris water maze', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'oxidized low density lipoprotein', 'parenchymal arterioles', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnant', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'response', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue oxygenation', 'way finding', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2021,181867
"Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited. Therapeutic clinical trials in TBI have yielded disappointing results owing in part to the difficulty in accounting for clinically important heterogeneity within TBI. Early delivery of therapy is essential after TBI to reduce secondary brain injury, but unrestricted treatment of all brain injuries could be harmful. TBI stimulates a complex cascade of immunologic responses, both centrally and peripherally. These peripheral immune responses to TBI could serve as an early sensor of risk phenotype given the rapid, readily measurable response in the blood. An improved ability to risk-stratify patients on admission will streamline patient selection for aggressive interventions—such as invasive neuromonitoring—versus selection of those patients who can safely be observed reducing potential harms. Holly E Hinson, MD MCR is a Neurologist and Neurointensivist at Oregon Health and Science University where she cares for patients with severe acute brain injury. The objective of this application is to develop supervised learning models of actionable short- and long-term outcomes post-TBI and to interrogate if pre-specified immunoregulatory proteins add predictive power to the models over clinical features alone. Her central hypothesis is that immunoregulatory proteomic signatures improve our ability to classify a low-risk clinical phenotype after TBI. Dr. Hinson’s preliminary data suggest peripheral cytokine levels are associated with actionable clinical events acutely after TBI. The project employs a highly-sensitive, single molecule immunoarray (SIMOA) to detect immunoregulatory proteins complemented with an unbiased proteomic approach utilizing global discovery mass spectrometry. She will develop and assess a series of models incorporating proteomic signatures to classify: acute progressive intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 1A), acute neurologic deterioration (Aim 1B), and long-term outcomes measured by the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (Aim 2). She will develop these models in a well-defined, clinical trial population (development set), and test their ability to correctly classify outcome in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort at OHSU (test set). Under a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, the project will generate new insights into low-risk phenotype recognition and outcome classification after acute TBI. The proposed patient-oriented research project will be enhanced by a structured didactic program in the principles of predictive modeling and patient phenotyping (including proteomics), which will provide Dr. Hinson with the critical skills she will need to conduct independent, innovative translational clinical research in the field of neurotrauma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited—we lack methods to assess a patient’s risk of deterioration at admission. An improved ability to classify patients early after injury will allow us to identify those who may benefit from aggressive interventions versus those who can safely be observed. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and assess a series of predictive models incorporating immune proteins from peripheral blood to aid in the prediction of which patients are at low-risk for complications and poor outcome after TBI.",Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures,10155597,K23NS110828,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Admission activity', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Holly', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Ion Transport', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Signaling Protein', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'TBI treatment', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'placebo group', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'sensor', 'single molecule', 'skills', 'supervised learning']",NINDS,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,188709
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10093160,R01NS111744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Limbic System', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Voting', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'animal data', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'data acquisition', 'data fusion', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'human data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'post-trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'support vector machine', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,243545
"EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy Project Summary Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI. Currently, there are no tools to identify patients a priori at highest risk for PTE. Dr. Kim's proposed career development plan has great potential to advance our knowledge of the acute biomarkers of PTE using EEG and MRI, to improve early identification and ultimately provide treatment options for this potentially preventable complication.",EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10192851,K23NS112596,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blinded', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Complication', 'Contusions', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Prevention trial', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rodent Model', 'Sclerosis', 'Secondary to', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'cost estimate', 'didactic education', 'disability', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'human imaging', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'preventable epilepsy', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,191054
"Poly-omic predictors of symptom duration and recovery for adolescent concussion PROJECT SUMMARY There are nearly three million mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) in the U.S. each year, and most occur in patients less than 21 years of age. Clinical assessment of mTBI relies on symptom surveys that cannot accurately predict the duration of symptoms or objectively identify brain recovery. A biologic test would allow physicians to provide individualized recommendations for school and athletics participation, prescribe timely pharmacologic treatments, or initiate early psychosocial services in patients at risk for persistent post- concussion symptoms (PPCS). Non-coding ribonucleic acids (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs, are epi- transcriptional molecules that are altered in patients with mTBI. They can be measured in peripheral biofluids such as serum, or even saliva. Our previous research demonstrates that ncRNA changes in cerebrospinal fluid are reflected in saliva, and that saliva ncRNA levels can predict PPCS. Validation of these findings in a large, independent cohort could yield a biologic measure of PPCS risk (Aim 1), and guide individualized clinical management decisions (Aim 2). This scientific premise forms the basis for our proposed multi-center study. We will enroll 750 adolescents (ages 13-18 years) with mTBI, defined by the World Health Organization and Berlin Consensus Criteria. We will measure levels of saliva ncRNAs enriched in neuronal and glial exosomes at acute (<48 hours), sub-acute (7 days), and chronic (30 days) post-injury time points. PPCS will be defined by persistence of ≥ 3 symptoms on day 30 (compared with pre-injury state, determined by the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory; PCSI). In 250 participants (training set), we will use a LASSO technique to refine a multivariate model, that employs acute and sub-acute ncRNA levels, along with clinical, social, and psychologic factors, to predict PPCS (while controlling for biologic covariates). Accuracy of the model will be externally validated in the remaining 500 participants (test set). Sensitivity and specificity will be compared to the validated “5P” clinical prediction tool. We will also examine the relationships between concussive symptom phenotypes and ncRNA levels with a factor analysis and hierarchical clustering. In Aim 2, we will use LASSO in a training set (n=250) to refine a second multivariate model, that uses acute and chronic ncRNA levels, along with clinical, social, and psychologic factors to identify concussion recovery. Recovery will be defined by self-report of “no difference from pre-injury” on the PCSI. Accuracy of the model will be externally validated in the test set, and compared to the accuracy of reaction time performance across acute and chronic time points. Our multi-disciplinary team includes experts in pediatrics, neurology, molecular biology, psychology, and emergency medicine with a published track record of collaboration and the expertise necessary for this proposal’s success. The study will yield an objective measure of PPCS risk, concussion phenotype, and clinical recovery. When paired with medical, social, and psychologic assessments, this technology will allow researchers to study mTBI therapies in biologically-defined patient subsets and personalize concussion care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury is extremely common among adolescents, who suffer disproportionately from prolonged concussion symptoms – a condition for which no biologic test exists. Emerging evidence suggests non-coding RNA released into saliva by neurons and glia, may provide a biologic window into the brain’s repair response. This study will measure longitudinal brain-related RNA levels in the saliva of adolescents with mild traumatic brain injury to: 1) validate an innovative method that helps clinicians predict the duration and character of concussion symptoms; and 2) define a biologic signature that aids assessment of concussion recovery for return-to-play and return-to-learn decisions.",Poly-omic predictors of symptom duration and recovery for adolescent concussion,10120964,R01NS115942,"['21 year old', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Athletic', 'Berlin', 'Biological', 'Biological Testing', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Injury', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Consensus', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Enrollment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Factor Analysis', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Olfactory Nerve', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Post-Concussion Syndrome', 'Prognosis', 'Psychiatric Social Work', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Reaction Time', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'TBI treatment', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'brain repair', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'concussive symptom', 'exosome', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiplex assay', 'neurobehavioral', 'patient subsets', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized management', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'protein expression', 'psychologic', 'repaired', 'response', 'response to brain injury', 'return to sport', 'saliva sample', 'social', 'social factors', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NINDS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2021,631685
"Virtual Histology for Assessing MS Pathologies PROJECT SUMMARY Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease with, ultimately, irreversible axonal injury leading to permanent neurological disabilities. Preventing disease progression or treating progressive MS remains a major unmet clinical need. We have previously developed a novel data-driven model-selection diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) to accurately image inflammation, demyelination, and axonal injury, as well as quantifying axonal loss in the presence of vasogenic edema in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and spinal cord injury mice, and brain WM pathologies in MS. MRI does not distinguish inter- from intra-axonal water signals, reflecting a weighted-average of signals between the two compartments. However, our recent observation that DBSI derived axial diffusivity (DBSI-λǁ) was slightly elevated in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in people with MS (pwMS). This elevated DBSI-λǁ added uncertainty in assessing whether axonal injury (against the notion that ↓DBSI-λǁ ≈ axonal injury) is present in NAWM of these pwMS. In this proposed study, we will refine DBSI to further improve its sensitivity and specificity to axonal injury/loss, demyelination, and inflammation for accurately assessing disease progression and therapeutic efficacy in pwMS. Since MRI does not distinguish inter- from intra-axonal water signals, it reflects a weighted-average between inter- and intra-axonal signals. In the presence of inflammation-associated edema or minor axonal loss in pwMS, the longer diffusion time for human scanners coupled with the increased inter-axonal space will lead to increased DBSI-λǁ masking the detectability of axonal injury. Thus, through separating inter- and intra-axonal water compartment signals, the sensitivity and specificity to axonal injury of DBSI-derived intra-axonal λ|| (DBSI-IA-λ||) may be improved. This new model will still preserve the isotropic diffusion specificity to inflammation and tissue loss. We propose three specific aims to prove or disprove this hypothesis: Aim 1. To perform DBSI and DBSI-IA analyses on autopsy specimens from pwMS followed by conventional histology and immunohistochemical staining. Aim 2. To perform DBSI and DBSI-IA modeling on perfused frog sciatic nerve with and without contrast agent to separate inter-/intra-axonal space water signal. Aim 3a. To develop a Diffusion Histology Imaging (DHI) approach combining DBSI/DBSI-IA metrics and machine/deep learning algorithms to recapitulate histology specificity to MS pathology. Aim 3b. To translate DBSI-IA model to analyze existing DWI data from the cohort of pwMS previously imaged in an expired program project. PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is common, affecting over 700,000 people in the US. It is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with pronounced axon damage inflicting long-term neurological disability. Accurate assessment of axonal injury early especially in normal appearing white matter is crucially important in therapeutic intervention. For example, we cannot expect remyelination to work on absent or critically injured axons. Thus, the proposed diffusion basis spectrum imaging to model intra-axonal diffusion for improving the sensitivity of detecting axonal injury is of great importance in treating and curing MS.",Virtual Histology for Assessing MS Pathologies,10121338,R01NS116091,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis', 'Experimental Designs', 'Fast Blue', 'Fiber', 'Gadolinium DTPA', 'Gadopentetate Dimeglumine', 'Germany', 'Glucose', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Myelin', 'Nerve', 'Neurologic', 'Optic Nerve', 'Pathology', 'Perfusion', 'Periodic acid Schiff stain method', 'Rana', 'Reporting', 'Ringer&apos', 's solution', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tolonium chloride', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'central nervous system demyelinating disorder', 'central nervous system injury', 'cohort', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'disability', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'manganese chloride', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'remyelination', 'sciatic nerve', 'severe injury', 'spectrograph', 'support vector machine', 'vasogenic edema', 'virtual', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,473791
"Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of neurological disorders and affects over 2.5 million people each year, yet no treatment has successfully translated from bench to clinic. TBI is a broad term and encompasses an extremely heterogeneous set of injuries differing by cause, severity, biomechanics, and the varied, complex secondary injury responses that collectively result in chronic disabilities. Current preclinical research circumvents the issue of TBI heterogeneity by relying on specific preclinical animal models that mimic subpopulations of patients and particular secondary injury mechanisms with each study focusing on limited, individual pathways. This proposal instead aims to tackle TBI heterogeneity by approaching TBI as a “big data” problem and aggregating and analyzing the multidimensional data collectively. A framework for data harmonization and curation will be developed, and datasets from a consortium of preclinical labs employing a variety of preclinical TBI models will be collected and curated into an open data commons (ODC-TBI). Utilizing machine learning and multidimensional analytics, the proposed research will directly leverage TBI heterogeneity in the merged dataset to identify persistent features of TBI to empower translational research. By creating a preclinical TBI ODC and applying machine learning to integrate the heterogeneity of preclinical TBI models, the project will reveal multidimensional features of TBI across heterogeneous injuries and characterize how diverse secondary injury mechanisms interact and ultimately affect injury outcome. Throughout the project's timeline, new datasets will continue to be harmonized into the ODC-TBI according to the established framework. The ODC-TBI will be the first open multicenter, multi-model repository of preclinical TBI data and will enable the application of data science to the field of TBI. Furthermore, the ODC-TBI and the methods implemented throughout the project will be openly shared to improve reproducibility of TBI research. Together with the multidimensional analysis that will provide quantitative and qualitative understanding of TBI heterogeneity, the project aims to ultimately accelerate data- driven discovery and precision medicine for TBI. Reflecting the complexities of clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI), preclinical TBI research is confounded by the extreme heterogeneity prevalent across possible injury models and resulting biological responses. The proposed research will aggregate and curate an extensive open data commons (ODC) of preclinical TBI research with multiple TBI models and utilize machine learning to tackle TBI heterogeneity directly. The project will create an ODC for preclinical TBI research to improve data sharing and scientific reproducibility, and will empower translational TBI research by identifying multidimensional features of TBI that best predict functional outcome.",Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility,10212363,F32NS117728,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Closed head injuries', 'Common Data Element', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'behavioral outcome', 'bench to bedside', 'biomarker discovery', 'controlled cortical impact', 'data curation', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple datasets', 'nerve injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'open data', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'response to injury']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2021,71224
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10223453,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regenerative capacity', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2021,188548
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,10261451,R33MH118170,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Astrocytes', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Production', 'Prognosis', 'RNA', 'RNA Probes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'endophenotype', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual response', 'injured', 'injury and repair', 'injury recovery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'machine learning algorithm', 'manufacturability', 'medical attention', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'microchip', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'nanomagnetic', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nucleic acid detection', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ratiometric', 'research clinical testing', 'response to injury', 'sample archive', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular injury']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R33,2021,379227
"Data-Driven Phenotyping of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Project Summary This predoctoral fellowship will provide the applicant (Hayley Falk), a doctoral candidate in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan, with the skills necessary to become an independent research investigator with expertise in novel applications of machine learning for TBI. The limited accuracy of current models for early prediction of GCS 3-8 TBI (commonly referred to as severe TBI) outcomes (prognostic models) is a major barrier to improving the clinical care of patients with GCS 3-8 TBI. Less than 20% of patients with GCS 3-8 TBI experience a good neurologic recovery and currently there are no therapeutic agents that improve long-term outcomes. In GCS 3-8 TBI clinical trials of promising therapeutic agents, a favorable outcome is typically defined as a better outcome than would be expected, taking into account the predicted prognosis for each individual patient. Therefore, accurate estimation of predicted prognosis is critical to assessing the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents. The leading prognostic models for GCS 3-8 TBI, IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI) and CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury), have undergone extensive external validation, however, the discriminative accuracy is highly cohort dependent with AUCs as low as 0.60 in some patient groups. The two major limitations of the IMPACT and CRASH models include one-time measurements of clinical predictor variables and regression-based methods, which are not designed to handle complex, multidimensional datasets. Our objective is to derive a dynamic prognostic model which provides updated outcome predictions as new data becomes available. We will then develop a clustering algorithm to identify physiologically distinct subtypes (clusters) of GCS 3-8 TBI derived from continuous, high frequency data streams. Our proposed goals will be achieved by the following specific aims: 1) we will derive a dynamic prognostic model using a RNN (recurrent neural network)-based framework and data collected during the first two weeks post-injury from BOOST-2 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Phase 2) which provides updated 6-month outcome predictions every 24 hours; and 2) using time series hierarchical clustering and continuous measures of physiologic parameters collected from subjects enrolled in BOOST-2 during the first two weeks post-injury, we will identify distinct subtypes of GCS 3-8 TBI and examine the association between subtype and 6-month outcome. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that our dynamic prognostic model derived from time-varying data will have a higher discriminative accuracy (AUC) than a static prognostic model (similar to IMPACT and CRASH) derived using single timepoint data collected on the day of injury. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that subtypes of GCS 3-8 TBI characterized by continuous physiologic parameters such as increasing ICP (intracranial pressure), decreasing CPP (cerebral perfusion pressure), and decreasing PbtO2 (brain tissue oxygenation) will be associated with poor 6-month outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed project aims to address the limitations of current prognostic models for GCS 3-8 TBI using state- of-the-art machine learning techniques including RNNs (recurrent neural networks) and time series hierarchical clustering. Using time-varying data collected during the first two weeks post-injury from GCS 3-8 TBI subjects enrolled in BOOST-2 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Phase 2), we will use a RNN-based framework to derive a dynamic prognostic model which improves upon the accuracy of existing static TBI prognostic models and a time series hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify distinct subtypes (clusters) of GCS 3-8 TBI derived from continuous physiologic parameters and examine the association between subtype and 6-month outcome.

"Physiology-driven seizure management post-cardiac arrest PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. Edilberto Amorim is a neurologist with subspecialty training in critical care and epilepsy who aims to employ biomedical technology innovations in brain monitoring to personalize treatment for patients with hypoxic- ischemic brain injury post-cardiac arrest. This career development award and its rigorous curriculum will establish Dr. Amorim as a clinician-scientist with independent expertise in: 1) Deep learning applied to physiology time-series, 2) Causal inference for observational data, and 3) Quantitative brain imaging. Every year, more than 500,000 Americans have a cardiac arrest. Brain injury is the number one cause of death for patients surviving initial resuscitation, and refractory seizures and other seizure-like brain activity are diagnosed in up to 50% of patients. Despite being a common complication, outcomes are dismal and current treatment strategies for seizures post-cardiac arrest are limited. Dr. Amorim aims to identify physiology-driven biomarkers of resilience to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury by utilizing state-of-the-art computational methods and a massive EEG and neuroimaging dataset with >1,500 subjects. His central hypothesis is that specific time- dependent changes in spike and accompanying EEG activity during cardiac arrest treatment predict seizure control and, ultimately, neurological recovery. The primary objectives of this proposal are: 1) Identify early longitudinal epileptiform EEG phenotypes predictive of neurological recovery using interpretable and deep learning algorithms; 2) Establish quantitative EEG biomarkers of seizure treatment response to anesthetics; and 3) Estimate the causal effect of rapid seizure treatment with anesthetics in preventing structural brain injury quantified with brain MRI. Dr. Amorim has generated preliminary data to demonstrate the feasibility of modeling EEG phenotypes longitudinally for outcome prediction and has applied quantitative EEG biomarkers to predict degree of brain injury on brain MRI. His primary mentor in this proposal will be Dr. Edward Chang, a neuroscientist and leader in human neurophysiology research. His co-mentors will include Dr. Brandon Westover, an authority in machine learning applied to critical care EEG, and Dr. Donna Ferriero, an accomplished translational and neuroimaging investigator in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Additional mentoring in quantitative neuroimaging (Dr. Srikantan Nagarajan) and biostatistics (Dr. Charles McCulloch) will be essential components of his training. These aims are expected to establish early non-invasive predictive biomarkers of neurological recovery and seizure control that may: 1) Guide patient selection for clinical trials enrichment and 2) Serve as target to therapeutic interventions after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. By leveraging the deep expertise of a cross-disciplinary group of world-class mentors and the unparalleled innovation environments of the University of California, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Dr. Amorim will be ideally positioned to uncover fundamental knowledge about epileptogenesis after acute brain injury as well as spearhead clinical trials focused on improving outcomes meaningful to cardiac arrest patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiac arrest impacts the lives of 500,000 Americans every year, and nearly half of patients surviving the initial resuscitation will develop seizures or seizure-like brain activity as a complication of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. We aim to reduce secondary brain injury and neurological disability from seizures after cardiac arrest by personalizing seizure treatment using EEG and brain MRI biomarkers of neuro-recovery. We expect that the outcome of the proposed studies will provide critical knowledge about epileptogenesis after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury andguide the development of goal-directed seizure treatment and patient selection in future clinical trials.",Physiology-driven seizure management post-cardiac arrest,10105883,K23NS119794,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'American', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Coma', 'Complication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intervention Trial', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Propofol', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resuscitation', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'authority', 'biomarker-driven', 'career development', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural hypothermia', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurological recovery', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'resilience', 'response biomarker', 'skills', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trend']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,191538
"Advancing Secondary Data Analysis: the ENIGMA Brain Injury Data Harmonization Initiative Project Summary/Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue globally, and while neuroimaging has been useful in understanding disruption in brain structure and function after injury, there are a number of factors that attenuate its prognostic ability. For example, there is tremendous heterogeneity in outcome after injury which is only partially explained by injury severity. Cost frequently limits sample size in neuroimaging studies, yet given the myriad factors that have been shown to influence patient outcome (age, injury severity, socioeconomic status), small samples and mass univariate testing often result in many studies being grossly under-powered. One solution is to combine data and create novel data sharing platforms, and the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium has supported this kind of collaboration for over a decade across a range of clinical disorders. The goal of this proposal is to develop tools and data processing procedures for use in the ENIGMA Brain Injury working group. In the R61 phase, we aim to develop and test a workflow for harmonized processing of behavioral data (Aim 1) as well as structural and functional (resting-state) MRI data (Aim 2). For Aim 1 of the R61, the goal is to offer a decision tree of procedures that is data-dependent, allowing investigators to establish common cognitive endpoints across cohorts that collect a range of neuropsychological and clinical measures. This proposal will create sharable procedures, flexible tools, and generalizable guidelines for best practices for extracting common cognitive endpoints from distinct behavioral test batteries (R61 Aim 1). In Aim 2 of the R61, we develop an image processing pipeline called Harmonization and Aggregation for Functional and structural imaging data PIPEline; HAF-PIPE) that allows for aggregation of non-equivalent imaging data. A primary goal is to decentralize ComBat, an open-source data harmonization tool, so that it can be used in a virtual sharing environment. Following satisfaction of the R61 Go/No-Go criteria, which is the curation of the dataset including 13 cohorts, extraction of common cognitive endpoints, and creation of HAF- PIPE, we will move to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase, we will leverage the large, harmonized dataset and apply a machine learning technique (CorEx - Correlation Explanation) to identify patient clusters within each patient population studied. HAF-PIPE and the procedures and guidelines from the R61 phase will then be extended to additional patient populations and made available to other ENIGMA working groups. The harmonized data, along with the tools and procedures for creating them, will be accessible to researchers following proposal submission and approval as a curated dataset. With success, this proposal holds the promise of significantly advancing data curation, harmonization, and sharing in the clinical neurosciences. We anticipate that our proposal will significantly advance our understanding of factors that impact outcome after injury and will yield a tool that will be useful across the neuroimaging community. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause widespread alteration in brain structure and function, but sample size in imaging studies is often limited, and differences in data acquisition and variables can create obstacles to data sharing. We propose to develop an open-source workflow for utilizing behavioral and MRI data that addresses these concerns and allows for harmonization across sites, supporting “big data” analyses that can identify clinically-meaningful patient subgroups in TBI, a goal that is not feasible with small datasets. Achieving the proposed Aims will make a curated and harmonized dataset available to the TBI community as well as procedures and data processing pipelines adaptable to other disorders in the clinical neurosciences.",Advancing Secondary Data Analysis: the ENIGMA Brain Injury Data Harmonization Initiative,10266848,R61NS120249,"['Address', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral construct', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'combat', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data curation', 'data harmonization', 'data ingestion', 'data pipeline', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'flexibility', 'heterogenous data', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'multimodal data', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'portability', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sharing platform', 'stroke recovery', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual environment', 'working group']",NINDS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R61,2021,921538
"Spatial Regulators of Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Disease Skeletal muscles are responsible for movement, breathing, posture and metabolism. Loss of muscle function via acute injury or chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) is debilitating to quality of life and is associated with high healthcare burden. In the US, there are over 12 million cases of sprains and strains injuries each year, an estimated 50 million people living with age-related sarcopenia, and another 250,000 with NMDs. My long-term goal is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms which underlie the muscle repair and develop therapies for chronic muscle disorders. A major barrier in this endeavor is our limited of understanding of the multiplicity of cell types involved during muscle regeneration. Little is known regarding functions of each cell type and how they interact with tissue-resident stem cells to regulate the restoration of muscle function. Thus, tissue cytometry, the mapping of single cells within tissues, is necessary to gain novel insights into cellular interactions during muscle regeneration and in dysregulated disease states. My central hypothesis is that local signaling in the cellular microenvironment regulate the behavior of critical cell types to remodel or repair the tissue. To this, I have optimized a novel multiplexed imaging technology (CODEX) that enables visualizes 40+ antibodies on a single muscle section. In the proposed research, I aim to (i) develop technologies to study cellular interactions using high dimensional imaging data and build a single cell resolution spatial map of the localization, abundance, dynamics, and interactions of 25 cell type within normal muscle regeneration and disease states; (ii) elucidate critical cell types and spatially-localized signaling that determine the proper expansion and differentiation of muscle stem cells; (iii) deep profile the function of M2 macrophages and fibroadipogenic precursors in process of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling. The training I will receive during the mentored phase of this proposal will be critical for the success of this project. Moreover, application of this systematic approach to study inter-cellular signaling will allow me to achieve academic independence. The proposed experiments in the K99 phase will provide novel insights into the coordinated process of tissue regeneration and will yield candidate signaling molecules with the potential to modulate the function of muscle stem cells. Further, the proposed project for the R00 phase will lead to better understanding of the cellular responses and fundamental mechanisms of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling, which has significant relevance for nerve injuries and chronic autoimmune neuromuscular diseases. Loss of muscle function in chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) is debilitating to quality of life and is associated with high healthcare burden. A major barrier in the development of effective therapies for NMDs is our limited of understanding of the various types of cells involved in normal muscle repair and what goes awry in disease. Here, I develop novel technologies to simultaneously visualize and study the interaction of more than 25 cell types in skeletal muscle, which will allow us to uncover critical interactions that determine efficient muscle regeneration as well as pinpoint disruptions in chronic NMD.",Spatial Regulators of Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Disease,10271399,K99NS120278,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmune', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Autoimmune Myasthenia Gravis', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Ligands', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Cells', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Muscle function', 'Muscle satellite cell', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Myasthenia Gravis', 'Myopathy', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Crush', 'Neuroglia', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular Junction', 'PTPRC gene', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Sprains and Strains', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'age related', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intercellular communication', 'macrophage', 'mdx mouse', 'mouse model', 'multiplexed imaging', 'muscle regeneration', 'myogenesis', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'new technology', 'novel', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'reinnervation', 'repaired', 'response', 'restoration', 'sarcopenia', 'sciatic nerve', 'stem cell function', 'stem cells', 'strain injury', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tissue regeneration', 'tissue repair', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,88722
"An advanced functional MRI study of frontostriatal injury in adults with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, or HAND, remains high in people with HIV (PWH); as a result, there is increasing pressure to identify neural targets for effective therapies. However, to develop effective HAND treatments, there is a strong need for the development of sensitive behavioral tests that can quickly screen and effectively identify probable neurocognitive impairment in PWH and biomarkers that can accurately determine HAND status and evaluate therapeutic effects. This 5-year cross-sectional and longitudinal study is theoretically driven and specifically designed to tackle these challenges. Neural injury to the frontostriatal circuits (plus hippocampus, thalamus, and other associated regions) has long been recognized as a key component in HAND; however, the association between frontostriatal injury and HAND status remains to be elucidated. Recent findings suggest that injury to different key regions in the frontostriatal circuits may play differential roles in HAND status: frontal injury is more prevalent in PWH, but striatal injury better predicts HAND status. This suggests that an accurate assessment of neural injury at different frontostriatal regions (plus other key regions such as hippocampus and thalamus) may have the potential to serve as a biomarker to assist with HAND diagnosis and characterization. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate frontostriatal injury in PWH using two behavioral paradigms that are known to involve distinct frontostriatal regions, along with two advanced functional MRI (fMRI) techniques, fMRI- adaptation (fMRI-A) and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Compared to conventional fMRI techniques, fMRI-A and MVPA techniques can better estimate neural tuning/selectivity that can be directly related to behavioral performance. Briefly, we hypothesize that frontostriatal injury – a central component in HAND – is highly prevalent in PWH and can be assessed behaviorally via two behavioral paradigms (Aim 1), and neurally via fMRI-A & MVPA (Aim 2). The integration of behavioral and fMRI data will help to assess the degree of neural injury at different frontostriatal and associated regions, which in turn may serve as a biomarker for HAND status (Aim 3). The probable impact of common comorbidities (e.g., history of substance and alcohol abuse, etc.) will also be investigated. In summary, this proposal is theoretically driven and highly innovative, with a strong promise for future clinically relevant development. The feasibility of the proposed research is supported by a strong foundation in cognitive neuroscience and neuroHIV, strong preliminary data, and an established research team. The success of this proposed project may help to develop sensitive behavioral tests that can effectively detect mild neurocognitive impairment in PWH, and a biomarker that can assist in determining HAND status/severity. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, or HAND, remains high in people with HIV (PWH). Neural injury to the frontostriatal circuits has been proposed as a key component in HAND, but the precise neural mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Built upon rich cognitive neuroscience literature and inspired by recent findings in neuroHIV research, we propose a functional MRI (fMRI) study to investigate functional disruptions to the frontostriatal circuits in PWH, using a novel combination of established behavioral test paradigms and advanced fMRI techniques.",An advanced functional MRI study of frontostriatal injury in adults with HIV,10450246,R56NS124422,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Variant', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'male', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nerve injury', 'neuroAIDS', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pressure', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'virology']",NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,585657
"Brain Injury Knowledge Ontology (BIKO): Identifying metadata variance in Traumatic Brain Injury therapy studies Project Summary Traumatic brain injury is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, yet there is no approved therapy for this injury. Although several therapies and procedures have been deemed successful for TBI treatment in preclinical research studies, many of these successes did not translate to human studies. One way to examine this challenge is to investigate the methodological variances in the associated literature. This proposal aims to use experimental methods and outcomes used in traumatic brain injury (TBI) therapy papers to create a metric to compare the methodological variance between multiple species by following three aims: 1. Training Phase 1: Establish the Brain Injury Knowledge Ontology (BIKO), a standardized ontology to define experimental design parameters and outcomes. 2. Training Phase 1: Create a knowledge base, BIKO base, of experimental design parameters (methods) and scientific claims (results) from the TBI treatment discovery literature. 3. Training Phase 2: Compare experimental differences hypothesized to lead to distinct outcomes between and across multiple species in TBI studies/literature using the BIKO. Upon completion, this project will provide a clearer understanding of past preclinical TBI therapy success and how it aligns to clinical outcomes to accelerate the discovery of successful therapies for TBI in human patients. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Although several studies have found successful therapies for TBI in preclinical studies, success has not translated to clinical studies. The goal of this project is to use text mining of the TBI literature to compare the methodological variance between published studies. to determine whether differences in methods across studies can explain why some studies fail.

"A multi-modality approach to decode epithelial heterogeneity and function in metaplasia 1) Background, key gaps in our understanding, and important challenges to be addressed. In response to injury, differentiated adult secretory cells in the gastrointestinal tract undergo metaplasia, or the conversion of one cell type to another. In the pancreas, this is called `acinar to ductal metaplasia' (ADM) and it is thought to function in tissue regeneration. The goals of our laboratory are to generate tools to understand the process of ADM, to identify the consortium of ADM cell types that emerge, and to determine their physiological role in tissue injury. 2) Description of recent progress by the PI. By the end of her post-doctoral work, the PI showed that differentiated, secretory cell types, such as tuft cells, form in the pancreas in response to ADM (DelGiorno et al. Frontiers in Physiology, 2020). Tuft cells are solitary chemosensory cells with myriad roles in mediating inflammation. Combining RNA sequencing, electron microscopy (EM), and mouse models of disease, she identified a functional role for tuft cells, the first description in any model of tumorigenesis (DelGiorno et al. Gastroenterology, 2020). Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and EM, she has identified the formation of several additional secretory cell populations in ADM of unknown function, which are now being studied in the DelGiorno laboratory. 3) Overview of future research program. We propose to continue our work on ADM by creating a workflow combining Single cell RNA-seq and EM Analysis (SEMA) to study epithelial heterogeneity in pancreatic injury with and without the genetic manipulation of identified cell types. Volumetric electron microscopy (3DEM) will be used as a substrate on which to map the information provided by scRNA-seq to reveal the spatial relationships between cells and infer the function of individual cell types through the study of their organellar content. Our approach leverages scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to conduct a variety of experiments on the same tissue including: [1] imaging of dehydrated whole-mount samples, [2] wide-field “chip mapping” of large areas of ultrathin sections, and [3] large-scale serial section approaches for 3DEM acquisition. Mapping is enhanced using correlative light and electron microscopy to assign molecular markers identified in scRNA-seq by immunofluorescence to cells with defining characteristics in SEM (e.g., nuclear shape, distribution of mitochondria, etc). Our 3DEM datasets are amenable to high-throughput image processing (e.g., segmentation, geometry processing) using machine learning and deep learning tool kits. Together, these tools provide a novel discovery workflow, which will be applied to projects throughout our laboratory aimed at evaluating cellular heterogeneity in ADM. Our goals for the next five years are to use this SEMA approach to build a multi-dimensional atlas of the cellular content and spatial relationships of the various emergent cell types in ADM. Mouse models lacking individual ADM cell subtypes will be used to assess phenotypic effects on cellular makeup, relative positioning, and disease progression. Together, these studies will provide invaluable insight into the role of ADM in tissue healing and regeneration in the pancreas. Technological advances in single cell RNA sequencing platforms have rapidly advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity within complex multicellular organ systems, however validating these data remain a major challenge. Ultrastructural electron microscopy is the gold standard for cell type identification by recognition of definitive physical features, however sample preparation and analysis are arduous and low- throughput. Our laboratory is combining these techniques with deep learning as a novel workflow to predict and confirm epithelial changes in pancreatic metaplasia to understand the processes and mechanisms underlying epithelial injury and regeneration.",A multi-modality approach to decode epithelial heterogeneity and function in metaplasia,10274940,R35GM142709,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Epithelial', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metaplasia', 'Metaplastic Cell', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Injury', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Secretory Cell', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'body system', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'epithelial injury', 'epithelium regeneration', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'genetic manipulation', 'healing', 'image processing', 'insight', 'light microscopy', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'pancreatic metaplasia', 'programs', 'response', 'response to injury', 'sequencing platform', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatial relationship', 'tissue injury', 'tissue regeneration', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,396250
"GeneRAlizable Sepsis Phenotyping (GRASP) using Electronic Health Records and Continuous Monitoring Sensors Abstract Sepsis, a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by whole-body inflammation caused by the body's response to an infection, is the most expensive and deadly condition treated in hospitals, with over 270,000 cases of sepsis-related deaths in the U.S. alone. Untreated sepsis may result in dilated and leaky blood vessels and severe hypotension requiring vasoactive medications (aka septic shock), and eventual injury to kidneys, lungs, and liver (aka organ injury) with mortality rates in excess of 40%. Successful prevention and management of sepsis, septic shock, and organ injury rely on the ability of clinicians to anticipate and estimate the risk, and administer the right life-saving treatments (e.g., antibiotics, fluids and vasopressors) at the right time. In recent years, data-driven modeling has been shown to enable early prediction of sepsis and to reveal clusters (or phenotypes) of sepsis, which may help with personalizing therapeutic interventions. However, crossing the translational chasm between clinical research and improving patient care also requires addressing 1) `data deserts' at different levels of care through better data integration, smarter lab ordering, and utilization of continuous monitoring wearable sensors; 2) interoperability and portability of clinical data and analytics; 3) principled dissemination and implementation studies; and 4) education of the next generation of caregivers to effectively utilize advanced analytical tools. The proposed research program builds upon PI's K01 early career development award focused on multicenter development and validation of sepsis predictive analytic algorithms (including hourly EHR data spanning ED and inpatient encounters from over 500,000 hospitalized patients across five district healthcare systems). Drawing insights from recent advances in domain adaptation and multi-task learning (sub-fields of machine learning), this project aims to discover generalizable dynamic phenotypes that are directly relevant to the prediction and management of sepsis, septic shock, and downstream organ injury. We propose to augment EHR-based analytics with high-resolution data from bedside devices (e.g., monitors, ventilators, dialysis, and IV pumps) and wearables (e.g., continuous blood pressure and lactate sensors) to address existing gaps in monitoring. Additionally, this program aims at advancing FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) interoperability standards through the implementation of specific resources for high-resolution data sources. Finally, this research program will be conducted in close collaboration with our dissemination and implementation and hospital quality improvement teams to ensure early assessment of usability, barriers to implementation, and effective education to maximize the potential for clinical impact. Project Narrative The proposed project is making use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and computers to collect and analyze data from hospitalized patients with sepsis. We plan to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for deterioration and which treatments they may benefit. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the care of hospitalized patients with sepsis.",GeneRAlizable Sepsis Phenotyping (GRASP) using Electronic Health Records and Continuous Monitoring Sensors,10277331,R35GM143121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hypotension', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Internet of Things', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Syndrome', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Ventilator', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'data integration', 'implementation study', 'improved', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'mortality', 'multi-task learning', 'next generation', 'organ injury', 'personalized therapeutic', 'portability', 'programs', 'response', 'sensor', 'usability', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R35,2021,395000
"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure.

We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident",10336135,U01AI148309,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood specimen', 'Bone Marrow', 'Burn injury', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cellular Structures', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Industrial Accidents', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Accidents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Accidents', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Saliva', 'Screening procedure', 'Seeds', 'Surface Antigens', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'base', 'biodosimetry', 'biomarker panel', 'biomarker performance', 'biomarker validation', 'blood damage', 'brca gene', 'data exploration', 'design', 'dirty bomb', 'dosimetry', 'humanized mouse', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'irradiation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'medical countermeasure', 'micronucleus', 'nonhuman primate', 'nonlinear regression', 'performance tests', 'peripheral blood', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sex', 'stem', 'stem cells']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2021,199999
"Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy PROJECT SUMMARY Injury is the most common cause of death in people younger than 46 years of age, and bleeding after injury is the most common cause of preventable death. Treatment of bleeding requires timely procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. Hospitals that specialize in treating injury have protocols, medications, devices and clinical staff available 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Injured people treated at specialized hospitals are more likely to live. However, there are far too many injured people every year than can be treated at specialized hospitals so minor injuries are cared for at hospitals not specialized in treating injuries. Severely injured people are taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries when specialized hospitals are too far away, or the emergency medical personnel underestimate how seriously injured someone is. Hospitals not specialized in treating injuries do not participate in ongoing injury clinical trials, regional data registries nor national quality improvement programs, and as a result what happens there that leads to people bleeding to death is unknown. This application's long-term objective is to improve the timeliness of treatment of bleeding after injury. The Specific Aims will be to: 1) understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in treating injuries; 2) identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment; and3) determine how to improve the timeliness of treatment. The central hypothesis is that treatment of bleeding is not standardized in hospitals not specialized in treating injuries and leads to a delay in transferring injured people to specialized hospitals. Identifying modifiable healthcare system, hospital, and patient factors can inform the design of a systematic process to quickly temporarily stabalize bleeding of injured people initially at non-specialized centers then expedite transfer to specialized hospitals by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals. This will ensure that people who are bleeding after injury are cared for at the right place at the right time. Ultimately, the right treatment at the right time will give people initially taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries the same chance at life as those taken to specialized hospitals. As a Career Development Award, the proposed training plan will include training in data science, systems engineering and design. The methods to be learned and employed will be machine learning, failure mode, effects and criticality analysis and user-centered design. The health relatedness of the project is to understand current practice management of bleeding after injury, in order to improve the timeliness of bleeding treatments to enhance the health of injured inviduals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Injury is the most common cause of death in people under 46 years old with more than 200,000 Americans dying annually. Bleeding accounts for 30% of deaths after injury, most of which are preventable if patients receive timely bleeding treatments including procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. The proposed resarch will understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in injury care, identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment, and then create an improved systematic process by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals caring for injured people.",Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy,10203288,K23HL157832,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Area', 'Bleeding time procedure', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Devices', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Practice Management', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Special Hospitals', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Work', 'blood product', 'clinical care', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'design', 'engineering design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'mortality', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'programs', 'prototype', 'severe injury', 'standardized care', 'stroke patient', 'supervised learning', 'time use', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K23,2021,190279
"Characterizing clinical and biologic features of persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) requiring mechanical ventilation is a common, costly condition with high mortality, yet treatment remains supportive. Identifying effective targeted therapeutics in heterogeneous conditions like AHRF depends on characterizing subsets, or sub-phenotypes, of patients with high likelihood of disease related events or response to therapy. This project will characterize a novel sub- phenotype called persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure (PHRF) among mechanically ventilated AHRF patients, with PHRF defined by ongoing mechanical ventilation and hypoxemia on ICU day 3. Using clinical trajectory to define sub-phenotypes in other heterogeneous syndromes has helped delineate patients with distinct prognosis and highlight biologic mechanisms contributing to trajectories. With large, independent prospective ICU cohorts from the University of Washington and Vanderbilt University, Dr. Sathe will address the following aims: (1) identify clinical factors on ICU day 1 associated with PHRF (2) determine biologic features of PHRF by analyzing ICU day 1 and day 3 circulating biomarkers of lung injury and (3) develop and validate a multivariable model that predicts PHRF on ICU day 3. Understanding risk factors for PHRF will help hone in on the early mechanisms important for pathologic responses to lung injury. Advantages to sub- phenotyping within AHRF rather than ARDS (where prior efforts were focused) include expanding the scope of patients we target for therapy and improving reliability of study definitions. In addition, discriminating between patients who will and will not develop PHRF will aid clinical prognostication, resource allocation, and targeted trial enrollment of patients unlikely to improve with existing treatment. The results will fill key knowledge gaps prioritized by the NHLBI regarding which factors determine risk for persistent hypoxemia, and the degree to which these factors overlap across ARDS and other conditions in AHRF. Candidate/Environment: With the support of the University of Washington, Dr. Mark Wurfel, Dr. Catherine “Terri” Hough, and biostatistician Leila Zelnick, PhD, this award will help establish Dr. Sathe’s career as a translational physician-scientist practicing Pulmonary and Critical Care. Through the proposed research, she will develop fundamental skills for analysis of longitudinal cohort data, contemporary machine learning methods for prediction, and high-quality measurement and analysis of lung injury biomarkers. This work will identify biologic pathways for more in-depth study in prospective AHRF cohorts, which she will pursue in a future K23. She plans to establish a career examining the heterogeneity of acute respiratory failure and other ICU syndromes, to advance the development of targeted therapeutics for critically ill patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The heterogeneity of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF), which includes such conditions as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia, has hampered the identification of effective, targeted therapeutics. Characterizing a subset of mechanically ventilated AHRF patients with persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure (PHRF) will help identify patients unlikely to improve with existing treatments and early biologic events leading to persistent hypoxemia. Examining the large, reliably defined group of AHRF instead of ARDS may expand who we target for new therapeutics, and clarify how biologic processes overlap across ARDS and other AHRF conditions.",Characterizing clinical and biologic features of persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure,10231616,F32HL158088,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Alveolar', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxemia', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resource Allocation', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'acute hypoxemic respiratory failure', 'biological heterogeneity', 'career', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'cost', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'longitudinal analysis', 'lung injury', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'participant enrollment', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'translational physician', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2021,79386
