"Adolescent Markers of Depression and the Impact of Alcohol Use PROJECT SUMMARY  This K23 award will allow Dr. Meruelo to become an expert on the relationship between adolescent alcohol use and depression. During his training, he proposes to address that untreated alcohol use disorder and depression lead to poor health outcomes ultimately affecting both quality and quantity of life. Dr. Meruelo plans to use an innovative approach and multiple imaging techniques of the NCANDA consortium in a longitudinal study to identify brain features that address the temporal relationship between these two comorbid disorders. Identifying risk factors is of critical importance to anticipating which individuals would benefit from earlier interventions and treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality directly. The award will provide him the support needed to develop expertise in four areas: (1) adolescent alcohol use and major depression, (2) neuroimaging and brain development, (3) advanced statistics, and (4) execution of longitudinal studies.  To achieve the K23's goals, Dr. Meruelo has assembled an expert multidisciplinary team. Drs Tapert and Brown will facilitate guidance and access to the activities of and data from a longitudinal study conducted by the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) to address one of NIAAA's major initiatives. They will also provide expertise in adolescent alcohol use and comorbid depression and on planning, recruiting, and implementing longitudinal study designs with adolescents, as well as career and mentorship on the responsible conduct of research. Dr. Schuckit will provide expertise on comorbidity between alcohol and depression and other career development skills. Dr. Thomas will provide hands-on training in advanced longitudinal analyses of associated data.  NCANDA data is already available to begin addressing central questions of the proposal. At Year 1 or 2, clinically significant depression has been identified in 61 participants after a healthy prior year following a non- depressed baseline. Also identified are those using moderate or heavy alcohol use at baseline, year 1, and year 2 of the study in 164, 223 and 283 participants, respectively. Year 3 data will be available January 2018.  The K23 research specific aims are: (Aim 1) to identify whether any adolescent alcohol use is more likely to lead to long-term depression, or if long-term depression is seen more often after subsequent increases in alcohol use, or both, using latent difference score models to distinguish cause and effect. The common factor of stress and subsequent depression and/or substance use is critical to understanding their impact on growing adolescents, and (Aim 2) to identify morphometrics that predict the development of depression in healthy adolescents using: (a) Naïve Bayesian classifier, and (b) principal component analysis with subsequent hierarchical linear regression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Twenty percent of teens suffer from depression before reaching adulthood and up to half of those also are engaged in using alcohol. This project will establish how the development of depression and alcohol use are related, in addition to ways to predict the onset of depression in healthy adolescents. By identifying temporal precedence in the relationship between alcohol use and depression, and predictors of when depression is more likely to occur, we will be in a position to improve treatment of those likely to suffer from depression and struggle with control over alcohol use, reducing costs and improving quality of life for patients, our health system, and society.",Adolescent Markers of Depression and the Impact of Alcohol Use,10180803,K23AA026869,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anisotropy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Youth', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'child depression', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'corpus callosum body', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral ventricle', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'skill acquisition', 'statistics', 'substance use', 'symptomatology', 'thalamocortical tract', 'underage drinking', 'white matter']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K23,2021,204109
"A Multi-omics approach to Environment and Depression in Parkinsons disease (MOOD-PD) Project Abstract We propose to use metabolic and multi-omic markers to elucidate how chronic, long-term pesticide exposures affect the occurrence of depression and anxiety in elderly living in a rural environment and those who develop Parkinson’s disease (PD) and depression. Depression and anxiety disorders are the most common types of mental disorders in older adults. Depression prevalence is as high as 25% in long-term care settings and strongly contributes to health care use for comorbid illnesses1-5. Major depressive episodes and clinical anxiety occur at a much higher rate among PD patients even well before PD diagnosis1,2. Improving our understanding of modifiable risk factors and mechanisms involved in depression and anxiety amongst the elderly is an urgent public health matter. Over the past two decades, our team has generated a unique data resource that now provides us with the opportunity to investigate the contributions of common and important environmental exposures (pesticides) to depression and anxiety and to explore disease processes through multidimensional biologic networks. With prior funding, we have collected lifetime depression/anxiety diagnosis and treatment histories as well as current (and follow-up) status of depressive and anxiety symptoms in a large population- based case control study of PD among residents of the California Central Valley, including more than 500 PD patients we closely followed for over a decade. Among these individuals, as many as 38% of PD patients and 27% of elderly without PD reported a diagnosis of depression or anxiety disorder at any time during their life. For all study participants we have genome (Illumina Global Screening Array, 660K markers) data available, and for ~800 additionally we generated epigenome (Illumina Infinium 450K DNA platform; genome-wide DNA methylation) and untargeted metabolomic data (at two time points for 300 participants). We developed a longitudinal geographic information system (GIS) based assessment for pesticide exposures that links state-mandated information on type, date, and location of all agricultural pesticide applications in California recorded since 1974 to land use maps and study participants’ residences and work places. Additionally, we collected extensive information on occupational, home and gardening use of pesticides. Biologic processes, including biologic (metabolic, epigenetic) responses to chronic toxicant exposures or disease processes are dynamic but also dependent on genetic susceptibilities. Here, we propose to combine a powerful systems biology analytic approach to interrogate epigenetic and metabolomic data anchored in genetics to identify signatures for specific pesticide exposures (organophosphates, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids) and peripheral disease processes related to depression in PD. Our data uniquely position us to efficiently conduct a high-risk pilot study that investigates multidimensional networks using supervised machine learning methods to identify chronic response patterns in biologic systems across different molecular layers that can be linked to exposure and/or disease processes. Assembling our multi-omic data into multidimensional networks will address gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms contributing to depression and anxiety disorders in PD, a major neurodegenerative disorder of growing importance in aging societies. Project Narrative Depression is highly prevalent in the elderly and in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients especially. We propose to identify multi-omics (genomics, epigenomic metabolic) signatures of chronic pesticide exposures and for depression in 580 PD patients and 250 population-control individuals and obtain a more holistic understanding of molecular changes contributing to depression and anxiety disorders and chronic pesticide exposures in neurodegenerative disorders. Our approach incorporates multidimensional network and system analyses to address gaps in our current knowledge concerning the contributions of chronic low dose neurotoxic exposures to complex neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases in humans.",A Multi-omics approach to Environment and Depression in Parkinsons disease (MOOD-PD),10304018,R21ES032593,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Location', 'Long-Term Care', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Occupational', 'Onset of illness', 'Organophosphates', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pesticides', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population Control', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'agricultural pesticide', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biological systems', 'brain health', 'cholinergic', 'clinical anxiety', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data resource', 'depressive symptoms', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'follow-up', 'genetic makeup', 'genome analysis', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'land use', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'minor depressive disorder', 'modifiable risk', 'motor symptom', 'multiple omics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'non-motor symptom', 'novel', 'pesticide exposure', 'population based', 'pyrethroid', 'residence', 'response', 'rural environment', 'screening', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,234000
"Characterization of Novel Neural Respiratory Circuit to Counter Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression PROJECT SUMMARY We have identified a novel property of the cervical spinal cord that modulates respiratory activity, both the rate and depth of breathing, such that the respiratory drive in opioid-suppressed states in mice and humans increases during spinal cord epidural stimulation. Respiratory rates are increased upon epidural stimulation of specific cervical spinal cord locations when there is spontaneous breathing, and rhythmic breathing can be generated when the respiratory state is depressed and spontaneous breathing is absent. This is an important observation because the brainstem, which contains the rhythm-generating center for respiration, is a difficult area for surgical and therapeutic access. If there are other accessible neural regions by surgery (i.e. epidural stimulation) or non-invasive means (i.e. transcutaneous stimulation), for example in the cervical spine, that influence respiration or contain their own rhythmic respiratory elements, these may represent potential therapeutic targets to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression. Thus, we have proposed a strategy to characterize this novel cervical respiratory circuit. First, we will conduct extensive electrical mapping of the respiratory responsive elements of the cervical spinal cord in mice aided by machine learning strategies, and we will characterize the mechanistic basis for this response, the relation to opioid receptors to the respiratory response, and identity neurons responsible for the respiratory response using optogenetic techniques. Guided by the animal studies, we will then confirm the cervical respiratory responsive loci in humans. Third, we will subject the identified respiratory competent regions to increasing doses of opioid to further characterize the dose-response profile of these regions. Fourth, we will assess the feasibility and practical translation of this strategy to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression in three patients implanted with spinal cord stimulators. These studies will provide an anatomical and electrophysiological characterization of the respiratory circuit within the cervical spine and provide practical information for the treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression. The results obtained, especially because they are obtained in humans, will have an immediate translational impact on our understanding of the respiratory circuit that may, in turn, prevent deaths due to opioid overdose. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid overdose often leads to death due to suppression of respiration; therefore, strategies to prevent respiratory depression in addition to treatment of opioid addiction are necessary to prevent deaths in the opioid-use epidemic. Respiratory suppression occurs because neurons in the brain that drive breathing are inhibited (turned off) by narcotics; thus, understanding the neural pathways for breathing will allow us to devise effective neuromodulatory strategies to treat opioid-induced respiratory depression. We have proposed to characterize a novel breathing circuit that, when activated by stimulation of the cervical spine, has the potential to be an effective treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression, and it is our hope that findings from these studies may lead to new and more effective treatments for respiratory depression secondary to opioid overdoses.",Characterization of Novel Neural Respiratory Circuit to Counter Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression,10176443,R01DA047637,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Cervical spine', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Coughing', 'Depressed mood', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Drug Implants', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Monitor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotics', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Respiration', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Respiratory Center', 'Respiratory Muscles', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Strenuous Exercise', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'Vital Statistics', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mu opioid receptors', 'neuroprosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'optogenetics', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'transcutaneous stimulation', 'translational approach', 'translational impact', 'ventilation']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,701059
"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,10177987,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic platform', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,603973
"Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of the proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to provide the PI with the mentorship, theoretical knowledge, and research skills to develop into a fully independent psychophysiological researcher studying biomarkers of depression that can be used as targets for novel interventions. In consultation with her mentors, the PI has recruited a team of expert consultants to guide her in executing a research project and training plan that will provide experience essential to her goals.  The proposed study will be conducted at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry. The study focuses on late-life depression because it is prevalent and has negative outcomes. Existing treatments have low response rates and are rarely used correctly in the community due to their complexity. The project is based on the premise that focused treatments targeting biosignatures of specific neural abnormalities will have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes in late-life depression. It concentrates on positive valence systems, which are vulnerable to aging and often impaired in depression. The project will investigate positive valence systems in older adults with major depression receiving Engage, a psychotherapy designed to reactivate reward system functions. Engage has been found efficacious in late-life depression and easy to learn by community-based therapists. Consistent with RDoC methods, the proposed study will examine target engagement of Engage in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) during a 9-week course of Engage therapy, using three units of analysis to assess positive valence system function: physiology (event-related potentials), self-reports, and behavior. It will compare Engage-treated participants with 35 depressed participants, group-matched on age, receiving manualized supportive therapy. Additional analyses will assess whether low baseline positive valence function, or increases in positive valence function during treatment, predict improvement of anhedonia with Engage, and whether reward function mediates change in anhedonia.  The proposed training plan complements the research study with individualized tutorials, formal coursework, research collaborations, and manuscript preparation that will provide the PI with knowledge and skills in several areas: 1) Age-related neurobiological changes in the positive valence system and related networks; 2) Advanced statistical techniques to identify distinct neural abnormalities in depressed individuals based on their ERP profiles; and 3) Clinical trial design for psychotherapeutic interventions. The proposed project may provide important information about target engagement and mechanisms of a biologically informed, easily implemented treatment for late-life depression that has potential for dissemination. It will also provide pilot data for an R-series study using machine learning methods to predict response to Engage and will serve as an important stepping-stone for the PI as she prepares for an independent research career. Late-life depression is prevalent and devastating, and response rates to even the most effective treatments are low. Outcomes may be improved by developing targeted interventions such as Engage – a new, easily disseminated, neurobiologically informed psychotherapy for late-life depression designed to restore impaired function of the positive valence system. The proposed study will use event-related potentials and a panel of other positive valence system measures to assess target engagement in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) receiving Engage therapy, with a comparison group of 35 age-group-matched depressed peers receiving supportive therapy.",Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression,10194608,K23MH116105,"['Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuscripts', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positive Valence', 'Preparation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Stimulus', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Visual attention', 'age group', 'age related', 'base', 'biosignature', 'career', 'career development', 'comparison group', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'extrastriate', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning community', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'opioid user', 'peer', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'sustained attention', 'trait']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2021,190534
"Next generation drugs for bipolar depression and maintenance Blue Oak Pharmaceuticals is developing the next generation of drugs for the treatment of acute bipolar depression and long-term maintenance (BPD), a mental disorder that affects ~6 million adult Americans. Existing drug classes are relatively ineffective and very few new modes-of-action have been developed in the past 40+ years. This is due, in part, to the biopharma industry’s focus on drugging single molecular targets, and the lack of predictive animal models for bipolar disorder. To overcome these significant hurdles, Blue Oak’s drug discovery paradigm combines custom-designed privileged chemotypes with a proven deep behavioral profiling method. Successful Phase I studies using this novel, but previously validated, approach resulted in the discovery and optimization of a novel lead compound for the treatment of BPD. The therapeutic utility of drug candidates was confirmed using molecular target profiling, ex vivo imaging of the forebrain circuits implicated in BPD and predictive translational medicine biomarkers. Phase II studies are focused on advancing the lead compound through Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies, the necessary next step for FDA review and approval of human studies. Aims include: (1) quantification of the preclinical therapeutic (safety) margin for the lead, or superior back-up molecule, including analyses of antidepressant activity; (2) confirmation of an enhanced EEG gamma band as a reliable translational biomarker of BPD drug activity and efficacy in non-human primates; (3) manufacture and qualification of cGLP drug product suitable for IND-enabling studies; and (4) completion of preclinical studies necessary for an IND filing with the FDA, including standard absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/TOX) preclinical studies and preclinical dose escalation studies necessary prior to first-in-human clinical studies. The successful completion of these aims will result in a Type B meeting to obtain guidance from the FDA and the filing of an IND package. The Blue Oak Pharmaceuticals team includes experienced “drug hunters” with expertise in systems neurobiology, medicinal chemistry and informatics, and advisors with proven track records in drug development and commercialization. The internal team is supported by trusted partners in preclinical research, development and validation of translational medicine biomarkers, clinical site management, and clinical development. If successful, this program will deliver a new drug candidate for bipolar depression that will improve the quality of life of patients and their families. This proposal aims to discover the next generation of drugs for the treatment of acute bipolar depression and long-term maintenance (BPD), a mental disorder that affects ~6 million adult Americans and imposes a significant medical, social, and economic burden. Unfortunately, existing drug classes are relatively ineffective for most patients and very few new therapeutic mechanisms have been developed into medications in the past 40+ years.

"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care. This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.",Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care,10207414,R44MH116751,"['17 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Moods', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Qualitative Research', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Specialist', 'Specialty Boards', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'checkup examination', 'child depression', 'control trial', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'programs', 'recruit', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'skills', 'success', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,507941
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,10051424,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'algorithm development', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,532914
"Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life ABSTRACT: Emotion regulation (ER) is a key transdiagnostic process and treatment target, with particular relevance to distress disorders (depression, generalized anxiety disorder). Distress disorders, which are characterized by heightened negative emotions, are prevalent conditions with considerable public health burden and comparatively lower response to treatment. The efficacy of interventions for distress disorders may be improved by investigating components of effective ER, both as instructed in the lab (ER capacity) and as measured naturalistically in daily life (ER tendency). Effective ER is based on key components such as accurate perceptions of one's emotions (i.e., emotional awareness) as well sensitivity to the environmental context (i.e., contextual sensitivity), which facilitate the selection and implementation of the appropriate ER strategy. For individuals with distress disorders, elevated levels of perseverative negative thinking (PNT) interferes with these processes, contributing to ER deficits and increased symptoms. This contextualized and integrative model of ER in distress disorders has not been tested, and very little is known about the predictors or outcomes of effective ER tendency—a critical gap given that ER capacity is irrelevant if ER is not employed skillfully in daily life. Furthermore, examinations of ER tendency can show how individuals, considering their particular characteristics and abilities, can optimally match particular ER strategies to the specific situations they encounter. The goal of this application is to evaluate components of ineffective ER— both in the lab and in daily life— that influence the severity and course of distress disorders and functioning. Consistent with NIMH strategic objectives and the RDoC framework, this project incorporates multimodal assessment, dimensional symptom measurement, and machine learning approaches. The proposed study will be comprised of 300 adults, oversampled for elevated PNT (50%). Participants will complete a lab assessment to measure predictors of ER capacity, followed by a 10- day ecological momentary assessment study examining predictors of ER tendency in daily life. To better capture negative emotions as they occur, reports in daily life will be physiologically-triggered with algorithms that detect potential episodes of psychological stress. Effective ER will be operationalized in multiple ways in the lab and in daily life, using self-reported changes in affect, physiological indices, and perceived ER success. Effective ER capacity and tendency will then be examined as predictors of distress symptom, functioning, and well-being trajectories assessed monthly for 12 months. Additionally, an exploratory aim is to create predictive models from a multifaceted battery of theoretically motivated variables that impact ER tendency and subsequent clinical outcomes. To this end, machine learning will be used to build a clinically-relevant framework for how person- level, situation-level, and ER strategy use interact to predict optimal ER. Overall, this project contributes to the long-term goal of identifying and refining targets for personalized interventions, by more precisely isolating key mechanisms of effective ER for specific individuals and the contexts they encounter in their daily lives. Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine predictors (i.e., emotional awareness, contextual sensitivity, perseverative negative thinking) of dysfunctional emotion regulation that contribute to depression and anxiety, as well as to provide an initial framework for optimal emotion regulation in individualized daily life contexts. This study uses multiple measurements (behavioral, psychophysiological, self-report, clinical interview) in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings in daily life, and it focuses on dimensional and transdiagnostic features that underlie multiple disorders. Consistent with NIMH's mission, findings will be relevant to public health because they can help refine intervention targets and inform personalized treatment for depression and anxiety, which are common and impairing conditions.",Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life,10162664,R01MH118218,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Applications Grants', 'Arousal', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'comparative', 'emotion regulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'random forest', 'response', 'success', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA,R01,2021,428695
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,10063043,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,498501
"EVALUATION OF MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE IN LATE LIFE DEPRESSION DESCRIPTION: Over the past decades, antidepressants and psychotherapy have been the first-line treatments for LLD. Despite being safe and well-tolerated, a large number of patients do not achieve full and persistent remission after initial treatment. About 50% of patients with LLD do not respond after two antidepressant trials, meeting the consensus definition of treatment resistance (TR-LLD). The persistence of chronic and elevated depressive symptoms in older adults has significant clinical and public health implications. This has been correlated to poor general health, reduced quality of life, and a higher risk of mortality when compared to those with sustained remission after treatment. Despite the relevance to public health of TR-LLD, there is little information about the biological mechanisms and no robust clinical prediction model to evaluate at the outset of antidepressant therapy who will or will not respond to treatment. Leveraging an NIMH funded clinical trial, the Incomplete Response in Late-Life Depression: Getting to Remission” (IRL-GREY), across 3 sites, in this study, we propose to evaluate the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression and to develop a machine learning based algorithm for prediction of treatment response in these subjects. We will carry out a comprehensive, multiplexed proteomic analysis on 542 samples from patients who completed phase 1 and phase 2 of the clinical trial. We hypothesise that ageing-related biological pathways (i.e. inflammatory response control, proteostasis control, cell damage response, endothelial function) will be associated with poorer treatment response in LLD. Moreover, we hypothesize that a machine learning derived biomarker panel will have sensitivity and specificity greater than 80% to predict treatment response in LLD. Finally, we will evaluate the biological mechanisms related to different depressive symptoms trajectories after treatment. This work will set the stage for a biologically-driven model of treatment response that will be useful to guide, at the outset of antidepressant treatment, those who will benefit more from a specific treatment. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting depression and reduce suffering for large numbers of elderly and their families. Using advanced molecular approaches, we will determine the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression. Our proposed study will also develop a predictive tool combining neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and protein data to identify who with late-life depression is more likely to have no benefit from antidepressant treatment at the outset of therapy. The goal of the study is to clarify the mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression, and whether we can effectively identify those who will benefit from antidepressant therapy at the outset of treatment.",EVALUATION OF MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE IN LATE LIFE DEPRESSION,10451378,R01MH118311,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Disease remission', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Endothelium', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'aripiprazole', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proteostasis', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'venlafaxine']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R01,2021,721224
"Technology Enabled Services for Coordinated Care of Depression in Healthcare Settings Abstract Technology-enabled services (TESs), which use web-based and mobile applications for patients coupled with support from a care coordinator, have consistently been shown through randomized controlled trials to be effective at treating depression. However, attempts to implement TESs in healthcare settings have failed, primarily because neither real-world patients nor providers use the tools we develop and evaluate in research. This center addresses this research-to-practice problem through a multi-level strategy. At the research proposal (RP) level, we will design and evaluate TESs for depression in three unique medical settings that commonly manage depression. Each RP will include a unique design innovation. RP1 will design and evaluate a TES to support a primary care collaborative care program. The design innovation of RP1 will focus on integrating mobile phone sensing technologies to create simpler, more engaging patient tools. RP2 will design and evaluate a TES for a specialty obstetrics care setting for postpartum depression. The design innovation will focus on care manager-facing tools and processes that can simplify, organize, and automate workflows. RP3, set in a geriatric service, will focus on homebound older adults, for whom there are few treatment options. The design innovation will be to harness a voice-controlled intelligent personal assistant to support homebound older adults, with supports for family caregivers. At the research level, we will harness the three RPs to refine our Accelerated Create-to-Sustainment (ACTS) research framework, which aims to overcome the research-to- practice gap in several ways. ACTS integrates human computer interaction (HCI) methods to incorporate the voice of end users into the design and evaluation of the technologies, service protocol, and implementation plan for the RPs, thereby ensuring that the end product is usable, useful, and can be implemented. Core research design elements and measurements are consistent across the RPs, which will allow us to evaluate the ACTS framework across all RPs to validate the core research principles of the ACTS framework. With the help of our External Scientific Advisory Board, will use this experience to produce research guidelines for digital mental health research, and aggregate the knowledge gained about TES and organization features into a taxonomy that represents essential information for researchers and developers. We will achieve this this work through a highly interdisciplinary team, led by two PIs who are leading experts in experts in digital mental health and HCI (Mohr and Reddy), with additional expertise in medicine, implementation science, psychology, research methods, and statistics. Each of the RPs is co-led by the clinic or service chief and a researcher, thereby ensuring a deep collaboration between clinical service needs and research. Thus, this Center, by using a multilevel approach focusing on both the individual research projects and methodology, will produce the first TESs designed for implementation in real world healthcare settings, and will provide substantial and enduring contributions to research methodology that will improve the quality of science. Narrative The Chicago ALACRITY Center will produce the first technology-enabled services designed to treat depression in 3 distinct care setting: family medicine, a specialty obstetrics care setting for postpartum depression, and a geriatrics service.

"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal care provided to the pregnant members of a large regional healthcare system.",Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App,10111569,R21MH119450,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disclosure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure to Thrive', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Psychometrics', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'fetal', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'motherhood', 'natural language', 'patient subsets', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'pregnant', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'routine screening', 'smartphone Application', 'social culture', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,194684
"SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics  The current best practice guidelines for treating depression call for close monitoring of patients, and periodically adjusting treatment as needed. This project will advance personalized depression treatment by developing an innovative system, DepWatch, that leverages mobile health technologies and machine learning tools to provide clinicians objective, accurate, and timely assessment of depression symptoms to assist with their clinical decision making process. Specifically, DepWatch collects sensory data passively from smartphones and wristbands, without any user interaction, and uses simple user-friendly interfaces to collect ecological momentary assessments (EMA), medication adherence and safety related data from patients. The collected data will be fed to machine learning models to be developed in the project to provide weekly assessment of patient symptom levels and predict the trajectory of treatment response over time. The assessment and prediction results are then presented using a graphic interface to clinicians to help them make critical treatment decisions. Our project comprises two studies. Phase I collects sensory data and other data (e.g., clinical data, EMA, tolerability and safety data) from 250 adult participants with unstable depression symptomatology. The data thus collected will be used to develop and validate assessment and prediction models, which will be incorporated into DepWatch system. In Phase II, three clinicians will use DepWatch to support their clinical decision making process; a total of 50 participants under treatment by the three participating clinicians will be recruited for the study. A number of innovative machine learning techniques will be developed. These include a set of new learning formulations to construct matrix-based longitudinal predictive models, and determine the temporal contingency and the most influential features, and deep learning based data imputation methods that can handle both problems of sporadic missing data as well as missing data in an entire view. In addition, multi-task feature learning models and feature selection techniques will be expanded and refined for this challenging setting of large-scale heterogeneous data. The project is highly relevant to public and global health because it will provide a significant step forward in providing effective and patient-centric care in treating depression.

Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,10226122,R01MH120158,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotional functioning', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'millisecond', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'preclinical study', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,706855
"Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rather than a dichotomy between health and pathology, many mental illnesses—especially depression and other mood disorders—are best conceptualized as the far end of a phenotypic spectrum, suggesting that characterizing individual differences in brain function and behavior will help further our understanding of disease. Existing work suggests that fMRI has the potential to predict individual behaviors from brain function, yet progress has been hindered by an overreliance on group studies (i.e., patients versus controls) and limited paradigms (i.e., either highly controlled tasks that risk being artificial, or at the other extreme, resting state, which is entirely unconstrained and difficult to interpret). Naturalistic fMRI, in which subjects do complex, engaging tasks such as watching films or listening to stories, offers an alternative that more closely mimics real-world cognition and may allow researchers to extract richer, more meaningful information from a single individual’s scan. As such, these paradigms are promising candidates for brain “stress tests” that would elicit patterns of brain activity that predict present or future behaviors. The specific aims of this project are: (1) to leverage existing large-scale datasets to develop methods to predict phenotypes from naturalistic fMRI data; (2) to design and conduct an fMRI study using targeted film stimuli to draw out individual variability of interest, specifically in traits related to depression; and (3) to extend the newly developed paradigms and analyses to a longitudinal study of a population at risk for depression and/or other mood disorders. Several innovative approaches to data analysis will be investigated. The central hypothesis is that brain activity evoked by these paradigms will vary across individuals in a continuous, multidimensional space that covaries with phenotype strength, that these relationships will be strong enough to predict phenotypes in unseen individuals, and that modified (e.g., attenuated) versions of patterns associated with illness will be detectable via these paradigms in those at risk before the emergence of symptoms. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded faculty member at a research-intensive university, with a research program exploring the basic cognitive neuroscience of individual differences in personality and cognition, as well as developing translational applications for psychiatry. To reach this goal, the training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s skills in the following areas: (1) applying machine learning techniques to predict individual-subject behavior from fMRI data; (2) conducting neuroimaging and behavioral research on depression and mood disorders with clinical and at-risk populations; and (3) gaining professional skills essential for a successful independent research career. The environment in which the career development will take place is the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, a vibrant community with outstanding resources to support the proposed project, including relevant courses and seminars, state-of-the-art facilities for MRI data acquisition and analysis, computing power, and expertise and guidance from senior scientists in neuroscience, engineering, machine learning and psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mental illness—especially depression and other mood disorders—is a massive burden on individuals, families and societies, yet psychiatrists lack brain-based biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. This project seeks to fill that gap by conceptualizing mood disorders as the extreme end of a continuous phenotypic spectrum in the human population, and using functional brain imaging to study how individuals differ in their neural and behavioral responses to naturalistic, emotionally evocative stimuli. This project will deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of individual variability related to mood disorders, and has the potential to lead to a “stress test” for psychiatry that would help identify at-risk individuals for earlier intervention.",Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum,10238174,R00MH120257,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Cognition', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Film', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hyperactivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Processes', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Normalcy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prognosis', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Senior Scientist', 'Social Environment', 'Societies', 'Stimulus', 'Stress Tests', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'emotional stimulus', 'healthy volunteer', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'member', 'mood symptom', 'movie', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R00,2021,249000
"Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Adolescent depression is a major public health concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We know that adolescent depression varies considerably in severity and course, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This proposal addresses this concern, aiming to identify biobehavioral predictors of illness trajectory in adolescents to inform treatment influencing its course. Our overall hypothesis is that reward dysfunction and its underlying neuro-immunological mechanisms contribute to maintenance of depression in youth. We propose the following model: (1) peripheral inflammation (e.g., cytokines, kynurenines) is associated with anhedonia; (2) inflammation extends to the CNS, inducing oxidative stress [↓glutathione (GSH, antioxidant)] and GABA (inhibitory neurotransmitter) deficits; (3) such neuro-chemical changes alter the reward circuitry, leading to anhedonia, and contribute to depression progression. In support, we documented that of adolescent depression’s core symptoms, only anhedonia—reflecting deficits in reward processes—and not irritability was associated with worse outcome, including suicidality and chronicity. We also reported associations between circulatory cytokines and kynurenines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry. Utilizing proton MR spectroscopy (1H MRS), we showed that decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA in adolescent depression was driven by anhedonia. Additionally, using fMRI, we mapped striatal-based connectivity in relation to anhedonia and documented distinct neural activation patterns of reward anticipation and attainment—both reward processes that contribute to anhedonia. In pilot studies, we found that ACC GABA and reward- anticipation brain activation predicted anhedonia severity at 2-year follow-up. Building upon our compelling findings to date, we propose a prospective study of reward processes and neuroimmunological mechanisms, with the goal to identify modifiable pathways predictive of depression course in adolescents. We will study 120 adolescents with depressive symptoms. Three in-laboratory comprehensive clinical evaluation and computerized reward task sessions will be done at baseline, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. At baseline and 12 months, visits will include: a) immune blood collection for kynurenine metabolites, immune cell profiling, and cytokine secretion post immune stimulation (as a biological stressor); b) fMRI resting state and tasks examining distinct reward processes (e.g., anticipation, attainment, learning); and c) 1H MRS to probe ACC GABA and striatal GSH as indices for inflammatory neurometabolic consequences in reward-related brain regions. Outcome measures will include anhedonia severity (primary), along with depression severity, functioning, anxiety, and suicidality. Principled variable selection approach will address multiple comparison concerns. Dynamic causal modeling and machine learning classification methods will explore the relationships among all examined factors.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to better understand the mechanisms contributing to the maintenance and severity of adolescent depression. A prospective multimodal study will test the overall hypothesis that reward dysfunction and associated neuroimmunological abnormalities contribute to depression progression in youth. Such work would provide information on modifiable factors to facilitate novel treatment approaches influencing the course of illness early on and prior to chronicity effects, so that we may work to ameliorate morbidity and mortality of this devastating disorder.",Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression,10128500,R01MH120601,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Antioxidants', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immune', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protons', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral construct', 'biobehavior', 'causal model', 'cell type', 'child depression', 'cingulate cortex', 'computerized', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pleasure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'reward anticipation', 'reward circuitry', 'sex', 'stressor', 'subthreshold depression']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,786200
"Title: Neurobiology of seizure generalization during electroconvulsive therapy for major depression PROJECT SUMMARY Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions, yet how ECT changes the brain to ameliorate the symptoms of depression is not well understood. Seizure generalization appears to be critical for successful antidepressant response to ECT, and stimulation dose is adjusted to ensure an “adequate” seizure. Previous studies have linked seizure generalization during ECT with thalamocortical regions, and our own MRI studies indicate that thalamocortical networks exhibit neuroplasticity after treatment in patients who respond to ECT. Yet, despite recent growth in the number of MRI studies measuring long-term neuroplasticity across ECT sessions, relatively less is known about the neurobiology of seizure activity elicited during each session. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to understand how ECT-induced seizures change brain networks to treat depression. To address this goal, we will take a data-driven, machine learning approach to pre-existing ECT-MRI datasets of patients with depression, to identify the neurobiological features measured with MRI (functional connectivity, gray-matter morphometry, electric fields) that optimally explain inter-patient variability in seizure indicators (seizure duration and stimulation dose). Aim 1 will identify biomarkers of susceptibility to ECT-induced seizures by analyzing pre-treatment MRI with respect to initial stimulation dose and seizure duration. Aim 2 studies will determine how brain network plasticity over the course of ECT relates to changes in stimulation dose and duration of ECT-induced seizures. These studies will further our understanding of therapeutic seizures in ECT, potentially facilitating prediction of optimal dose and/or treatment outcome to improve ECT and minimize side effects. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions, yet how ECT changes the brain to ameliorate the symptoms of depression is not well understood.

"Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective and easy-to-tolerate treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). TMS is costly and time-intensive so identifying markers of response would reduce financial and psychological burden. Further, treatment response is highly variable. Clinical and diagnostic heterogeneity of depression contributes to significant variability in neural markers of response. The literature on neural markers is complicated by variability in TMS intensity and targets, which may further modify response. Electrical field models estimate the degree to which a target is stimulated by considering both the intensity and structural information of each participant but at this time there are no studies that have investigated the association between brain electrical fields and treatment response. Moreover, the neurobiological correlates of dorsolateral (dlPFC) TMS treatment response are not well understood. Machine learning may be able to help us understand these complex set of features and their association to treatment response. Thus to appropriately personalize treatments, I will develop a data-driven machine learning model that uses the following: (1) pre- treatment resting state connectivity that reflects circuit dysregulation; (2) electrical field modeling to estimate the electrical field or voltage on individual patient’s brain, as a marker of sufficiency of stimulation; and (3) expected target network connectivity as a marker of target engagement. We have previously demonstrated feasibility of machine learning to predict antidepressant response in MDD. We will optimize and expand a model developed on archival University of Toronto data that predicted dlPFC TMS response. We will validate this externally on three sets of data: data we collect at University of Pittsburgh, archival data from Brown University, and sham TMS data. As an exploratory aim, we will identify whether our model that predicts dlPFC TMS treatment response is capable of predicting response to dmPFC TMS stimulation. During my PhD in Bioengineering, I developed kernel-based machine learning models to personalize neural networks markers of antidepressant response. Given the clinical and neural heterogeneity of depression, I will leverage my machine learning and neuroimaging experience by receiving training in advanced optimization approaches and depression neurobiology to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments. This will allow me to develop optimized models of treatment response and facilitate my long-term career goal to develop personalized treatment algorithms using large-scale data. My previous experiences in machine learning, bioengineering, neuroimaging, as well as the preliminary understanding of depression uniquely position me to maximize the benefits of training aims outlined in this proposal. 1 This is a K01 application designed to develop a data-driven machine learning model that will take into account several neural markers of response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). The application proposes expanded training in machine learning optimization approaches and depression neurobiology for the applicant, who has a PhD in Bioengineering. The goal of the study is to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments, which matches the candidate’s long-term goal to conduct research on and develop models that personalize medicine for depression. 1",Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD,10125330,K01MH122741,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Archives', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Placebos', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Universities', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'electric field', 'executive function', 'experience', 'individual patient', 'large scale data', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'support vector machine', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'voltage']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2021,170027
"Positive valence systems engagement during social reward exposure psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  The proposed K23 Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is designed to provide the candidate with the conceptual knowledge and technical skills needed for a career of an independent investigator focused on the engagement of behavioral and neural network targets during personalized psychotherapies for mid- and late depression. The candidate will conduct her training and research activities at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry.  The proposal is based on the premise that identifying specific behavioral and neural network targets can guide development of streamlined interventions with potential for broad scalability and reach. “Engage”, a streamlined therapy for late-life depression, whose principal intervention is “reward exposure”, may change Positive Valence Systems (PVS) functions. Preliminary studies by the candidate show that early increase in resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of PVS structures during “Engage” predicts increased behavioral activation. Additionally, compared to solitary pleasant activities, exposure to rewarding social interactions during “Engage” leads to greater increase in behavioral activation and reduction of depression severity. Finally, a machine learning analysis conducted by the candidate showed that low perceived social support is the strongest predictor of poor response early in psychotherapy. These findings are in line with animal and human studies demonstrating the protective role of social rewards. Based on these observations, the candidate developed “Engage-S”, a social-reward based version of “Engage”, aimed to increase exposure to meaningful social interactions with others.  The training study proposes to examine whether social reward exposure in “Engage-S” enhances PVS abnormalities and improves mid- and late-life depression. The participants will be 60 middle-aged and older adults (age ≥ 50) with major depression who will be randomized to 9-weeks of “Engage-S” or to a Symptom Review and Psychoeducation (SRP) comparison condition. During treatment, we will examine target engagement of the PVS with rsFC, a behavioral activation scale (BADS), and performance on a novel social reward paradigm at baseline, 5 weeks, and 9 weeks. We will use computational methods to identify neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with treatment response.  The training plan consists of formal courses, structured tutorials, and hands-on methodological training that will offer the candidate knowledge and skills in: 1) Functional neuroanatomy of depression and aging; 2) Use of fMRI to assess target engagement during psychotherapies for mid- and late-life depression; 3) Computational modeling for the identification of clinical and neuroimaging predictors of treatment response that can be used to personalize psychotherapy; and 4) Generate preliminary data for an R-series experimental therapeutics target engagement application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Abnormalities in the Positive Valence System (PVS) are associated with depressive symptoms and reduced behavioral activation in mid- and late-life. This study will investigate the engagement of the PVS during exposure to social rewards, part of a novel streamlined psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression.

"Remote computational phenotyping of behavioral and affective dynamics in major depression PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Major depression is a highly debilitating disorder affecting over 300 million people worldwide. Treatment assignment can involve a lengthy trial-and-error process complicated by symptom heterogeneity. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix provides a framework for investigating psychiatric disorders that integrates across multiple levels of analysis. Depressive symptoms are closely linked to the RDoC Positive Valence Systems (PVS) domain, but it is unknown how PVS constructs relate to common depressive symptoms including low mood, anhedonia, and apathy. Computational probes of behavioral and affective dynamics show great promise as a means of ‘computationally phenotyping’ individuals and providing a way to validate PVS constructs in relation to symptom heterogeneity. The ubiquity of smartphones makes them an ideal platform for remote testing. We propose to collect longitudinal data using smartphones for three ‘gamified’ tasks that measure risky decision making, probabilistic reinforcement learning, and reward-effort trade-offs and concurrent fluctuations in affective state. We will establish the reliability of remotely collected computational assays of behavioral and affective dynamics for understanding heterogeneity in depressive symptoms. We will first test a community sample (n=200) both in the lab and remotely by smartphone to verify that behavioral and affective computational parameters have the same relationship to depressive symptoms (low mood, anhedonia, and apathy) in both environments (Aim 1). We will then recruit a large sample of patients with moderate depressive symptoms (n=400) and test them remotely using smartphones for up to 12 months (Aim 2). We will test whether behavioral and affective computational parameters are related to changes in depressive symptoms over time. We will also use data-driven recurrent neural network approaches to identify additional features of our data related to depressive symptoms. Finally, we will collect MRI scans and in-lab data in a subsample of patients (n=200) from Aim 2 and ask whether reward sensitivity and reward prediction error, features of all three tasks, map onto consistent neural circuitry and depressive symptoms (Aim 3). We will test for a mapping between depression subtypes defined by brain network connectivity, behavioral and affective computational parameters, and depressive symptoms. Using computational models, we can bridge between levels of circuits, behavior, and self-report, and test for a mapping onto heterogeneity in symptoms, enhancing our understanding of RDoC constructs and paving the way for more effective and timely interventions to treat depression. PROJECT NARRATIVE The heterogeneity of major depression presents a problem for effective treatment. We propose to use a combination of lab- and smartphone-based data collection to describe the quantitative relationship between brain network connectivity, computational models of behavioral and affective dynamics, and depressive symptoms over multiple months.

"Risk modeling and shared decision making for postpartum depression PROJECT ABSTRACT Postpartum depression (PPD) is a strikingly common and potentially life-threatening mental health condition, affecting 1 in 5 mothers in the US. PPD poses serious health concerns, not only to mothers but also their children and the family. PPD has been associated with increased infant mortality, higher rates of hospitalizations, impaired mother-child attachment, developmental problems in children, and increased stress within families. However, in reality, women who are at high risk for depression during the childbearing years are usually neither identified nor treated. In addition, even when depression is detected by health professionals, women rarely obtain assistance, despite the wide availability of treatment choices. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to develop automated, scalable risk prediction models for PPD. We will also develop a digital shared decision-making (SDM) tool for PPD treatment by working collaboratively with healthcare providers and patients. The PPD risk model and the digital SDM tool for PPD treatment developed in this STTR Phase I project will be used to conduct a future large, prospective, multi-site clinical effectiveness trial to test their feasibility and utility in routine clinical care of women during the postpartum period.

"Deciphering principles of network dynamics underlying depression symptom severity from multi-day intracranial recordings in patients with major depression PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common and causes significant disability world-wide. While typically responsive to medications and therapy, there remain a subset of patients who are treatment resistant. Novel approaches are critical to treat these patients. MDD is likely caused by dysfunction in distributed neural networks, a perspective consistent with the etiological and diagnostic heterogeneity of this disorder. While imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) have helped identify MDD circuitry, no consensus has been reached on the identification of diagnostic biomarkers. Furthermore, the dynamics of MDD circuitry in relation to symptom severity is unknown. Characterization of circuit signatures that define MDD symptom severity states and the extent to which these circuits are modifiable using electrical stimulation are critical for therapeutic advancement.  Intracranial EEG (iEEG) offers a high spatial and temporal resolution method to study depression networks. For the first time, we have an unparalleled opportunity to study such circuits in MDD patients participating in a clinical trial of personalized responsive neurostimulation for treatment resistant depression (PRESIDIO). In stage 1 of this trial, participants are implanted with 160 electrodes from 10 sub-chronic intracranial leads across 10 brain sites for 10 days. The goal of this parent study stage is to optimize brain-site targeting for deep brain stimulation. In this proposal, we will leverage the opportunity to study MDD circuit principles from cortical and deep brain structures over a multi-day time period.  In an ancillary study to this parent clinical trial, we propose a set of experiments that establish basic principles of network dynamics underlying MDD from direct neural recordings. This proposal is organized around the principal concept that brain circuit dysfunction is reflected in abnormal signatures of functional connectivity and rhythmic local-field activity. This concept is supported by our pilot work where we found evidence of distinct MDD networks characterized by functional connectivity and spectral activity. Furthermore, in the first parent trial participant we successfully mapped MDD circuits at the individual level and found that gamma power in the amygdala could successfully decode mood state (AUC = 86%). This proposal builds on these preliminary findings in two aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize state-dependent functional connectivity and spectral activity in relation to symptom severity. In Aim 2, we will examine the manner and time course in which targeted electrical stimulation acutely modifies circuits. Together, this research will yield the first characterization of connectivity and activity dynamics in MDD over a multi-day period from direct neural recordings. This rare insight into MDD circuity provided by this novel dataset establishes proof-of-concept principles for biomarker development and therapeutic target selection that could critically advance personalized MDD treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The characterization of circuit dynamics underlying mood states in major depression and the acute modifiability of circuit features is an innovative and poorly understood area of research. Using an unparalleled dataset of invasive multi-day neural recordings from 160 contacts in patients with major depression who are taking part in a clinical trial of closed loop deep brain stimulation (PRESDIO trial), we seek to identify a set of neural connectivity and activity features that characterize symptom severity states, and to determine whether circuit features can be acutely modified by brain stimulation. This work has high translational potential for development of novel circuit-based neuromodulation therapies for major depression.",Deciphering principles of network dynamics underlying depression symptom severity from multi-day intracranial recordings in patients with major depression,10104344,R21MH124759,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Ancillary Study', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Moods', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'comorbid depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2021,242250
"Invasive decoding and stimulation of altered reward computations in depression Abstract Depression is a highly prevalent mental health disorder that affects millions of people in the US and causes significant impacts on well-being, rates of disability and health care costs. Despite these substantial impacts and costs, the effectiveness of current therapeutical options for the treatment of depression is limited. In recent years there have been efforts to develop deep-brain stimulation (DBS) strategies guided by results from non-invasive imaging studies. Unfortunately, these have failed to show significant efficacy, likely because of the vast heterogeneity in disease presentation and the lack of sufficient data to understand the neurobiological causes of the disease. Current approaches use unspecific biological (pharmacology) or anatomical (DBS) targets, leading to partial effectiveness and side effects. Patient-specific depictions of the basis of depression would allow tailored treatment designs, but data of sufficient quality is mostly unavailable with standard approaches to the study of neural function. Recent approaches leverage multi-areal invasive electrophysiological recordings in neurosurgical epilepsy patients, which often suffer from co-morbid depression, to collect of high-quality (multi-areal, high signal-to-noise, high temporal resolution) neurophysiological data, and have the potential to allow patient-specific models of disease and targeted neurostimulation. In addition, machine learning methods allow mapping this high-dimensional neural data onto patient’s emotional states centrally affected in depression, and highlight the involvement of single-site and cross-areal activity in limbic regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. However, decoding methods present several challenges of their own. First, they select features associated with self-reported mood - a complex, abstract concept that lacks an objective, quantitative foundation and may be reported differently across patients, making generalization challenging. Second, data-driven methods are not grounded on current models of brain function, and thus lack mechanistic explanations of disease underpinnings. Third, mood is reported in the absence of overt behavior, making it difficult to frame the deficits in the behavioral functions subserved by affected brain areas. Finally, current approaches lack a connection between decoded neural features and stimulation strategies. Here, we propose to address these challenges by combining distributed iEEG recordings, reinforcement learning models of decision-making and machine-learning approaches to study reward processing in relevant brain areas from epilepsy patients with and without comorbid depression. We will examine local activations as well as circuit dynamics (functional connectivity) in orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus during decision- making behavior. We will seek to ground neurophysiological data in reinforcement learning models of decision-making to provide quantitative, reproducible behavioral metrics that impact mood, and to build on long-standing observations regarding damaged reward processing in depression. Finally, we will develop patient-tailored stimulation paradigms for depression constrained by our observations on patient-specific disease presentation. We expect that the combination of invasive recordings with reward modeling will open the door to a theoretically-grounded computational characterization of neurobehavioral deficits in depression, and allow development of novel treatment strategies. Project narrative Depression is highly prevalent in intractable epilepsy patients undergoing invasive electrophysiological monitoring, which provides a unique opportunity to study highly detailed, multi-areal brain activity across depression states. We propose to combine distributed intracranial electroencephalography recordings, reinforcement learning of decision-making and machine-learning approaches to study how reward and mood processing is affected across multiple brain areas in depression. We will use the resulting models of the neurobehavioral basis of depression to develop new patient-tailored invasive neurostimulation therapeutical strategies.",Invasive decoding and stimulation of altered reward computations in depression,10282883,R01MH124763,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Pharmacology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regrets', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'brain machine interface', 'comorbid depression', 'cost effectiveness', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'neural model', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'side effect', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'therapy design', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,767520
"Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is an impairing and prevalent mood disorder in adolescence, affecting 1 in 6 youth by age 18. So far, the use of conventional statistical approaches has had limited success in delivering tools for accurate individualized prediction of future depression for a specific child. The objective of this project is to build advanced non-linear machine learning algorithms integrating information from multiple sources to deliver accurate, individualized prediction. To accomplish this objective, the research team will use 5,000 variables (biological, cognitive, socio-emotional, environmental) measured on multiple occasions between the prenatal period and age 10 in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 15,636). The goal is to use features from the prenatal period to age 10 to estimate risk of reaching clinical levels of depressive symptoms between the ages of 12 and 18 years old. The research team will pursue two specific aims. The first aim is to build an algorithm for accurate prediction of adolescent depression by using informative features from the prenatal period until age 10 with machine learning methods that capture complex, multi-variate associations. The team will use several techniques, including artificial neural networks that exploit temporal information (recurrent neural networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to identify constellations of highly predictive features. Based on early-life stress sensitization theory, the first hypothesis is that features from the prenatal and early postnatal periods (up to age 5) provide greater predictive power than features from ages 6-10. The second aim is to determine if features predicting depression are unique to depression or shared with anxiety disorder and substance use disorder. Machine learning algorithms will predict age 18 clinical diagnoses of depression, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder. The team will test the second hypothesis that some predictive features will be unique for each disorder and some will be shared across all three disorder types (e.g., childhood trauma). By accomplishing these aims, the research team will devise a clinically useful algorithm to estimate a child’s probability of developing adolescent depression. All software that will be created for this project will be open-source, and made freely available online in public repositories. Algorithms that would allow accurate early identification of children at risk to develop depression during future adolescent years would provide new avenues for preemptive interventions. This would yield enormous public health benefits by prioritizing treatment and shifting developmental trajectories away from eventual disorder for millions of individuals worldwide. To realize the potential of this overall impact on the field and society, predictive models that calculate risk with high sensitivity and specificity in childhood are needed. The proposed project aims to use robust, rigorous machine learning algorithms to take on this challenge. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on depression in adolescence, which is highly prevalent and impairing during this life stage and a major risk factor for suicide. The project is relevant to NIMH’s mission because it aims to identify early behavioral and biological indicators of risk for depression in order to predict the onset of illness and support early preemptive interventions.",Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning,10108555,R21MH125346,"['18 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crude Extracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Benefit', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adverse childhood events', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'developmental psychology', 'early life stress', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'long short term memory network', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'maltreatment', 'open source', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized predictions', 'postnatal period', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'preemptive intervention', 'prenatal', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public repository', 'recurrent neural network', 'speech recognition', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2021,179604
"Sensing Technologies for maternal depression treatment in low resource settings (StandStrong) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a high global burden of untreated postpartum depression. Untreated postpartum depression presents acute and long-term risks to a mother's mental and physical health, as well as her child's survival, health, and development. Although there is increasing willingness among funders and health systems to involve non- specialists, such as community health workers, in the delivery of psychological interventions for postpartum depression, the outcomes of these non-specialist interventions have been mixed. Digital technology, specifically the use of passive sensing data collection to learn more about a mother's life and support behavior change, has the potential to improve the effectiveness of psychological interventions delivered by non-specialists. For the proposed R21/R33, we will build on preliminary development work of Sensing Technologies for Maternal Depression Treatment in Low Resource Settings (StandStrong) to demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and functionality for postpartum depression treatment in Nepal. StandStrong is a digital platform consisting of two mobile apps, internet-of-things (IoT) passive sensors, and a data analysis engine built using modern machine learning approaches. StandStrong incorporates passive sensing data collection from mothers and their infants that can be monitored by non-specialist counselors and then incorporated to better personalize psychological treatment. For Aim 1 (R21 phase), we will use human-centered design to iteratively refine the StandStrong platform and associated implementation material. For Aim 2 (R21 phase), we will evaluate the StandStrong platform and associated contents according to acceptability, feasibility, usage, benefit, and validity. If milestones are met for the R21, we will proceed to the R33 stage, in which we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a psychological treatment as usual with the psychological treatment supplemented by the StandStrong passive sensing platform with 112 depressed mothers (56 in each arm). For Aim 3 (R33 phase), we will identify parameters for sustainability and scalability through engagement of policy, healthcare, and telecom stakeholders, as well as costing the intervention and building mHealth research capacity. Successful completion contributes to the NIMH's 2020 Strategic Plan to tailor existing interventions and develop innovative service deliver for diverse populations. This project will contribute to NIMH's Opportunities and Challenges of Developing Information Technologies through improving treatment of mental illness through use of passive sensing technologies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Untreated postpartum depression impacts maternal morbidity and mortality and has long-term impacts on children's survival, mental and health physical health, and development. We will refine development of a digital platform that can be used by non-specialists to improve delivery of psychological interventions for postpartum depression by incorporating passive sensing data collected from a mobile phone and passive Bluetooth beacon with the mother and her infant.

"Integrating Health Records, Genomic, and Social Data to Stratify Adolescent Depression Risk PROJECT ABSTRACT One in five adolescents in the United States will experience a depressive episode before age 18. Early prevention could offset a lifetime of morbidity including work and social impairment, substance use, and suicidal behavior. A critical step to preventing adolescent depression at a population level is the efficient detection of individuals who could benefit most from targeted intervention. However, known risk factors (e.g., subthreshold symptoms, cognitive styles, interpersonal factors) are often not widely assessed in practice until young people are presenting for psychiatric care, and prospective risk screening tools built in traditional research studies remain poorly implemented at scale in clinical settings where it may not be feasible for providers to routinely collect or integrate additional measures. Large-scale, routine electronic health records (EHRs) from major health systems present a powerful opportunity to overcome these prior limitations but have not yet been harnessed for adolescent depression and often lack environmental and genetic data that may inform etiological understanding and risk stratification. The overall aim of this K08 Career Development Award is to leverage large-scale EHR data with linked genomic and social determinants to enhance the systematic identification of young people at elevated risk of depression in real-world health settings. In this project, the candidate will develop and validate a novel phenotype algorithm for identifying adolescent depression cases from a major healthcare system in the United States containing up to 20 years of longitudinal EHR data for over six million individuals (Aim 1); integrate and comprehensively assess a range of potential social and genomic determinants for EHR-based adolescent depression (Aim 2); and apply modern statistical and machine learning methods to train and evaluate an initial prospective risk stratification model for adolescent depression based on routine EHR data (Aim 3). Improving the phenotyping and stratification of adolescent depression in EHRs will facilitate new avenues of research that will be the basis of subsequent R-level grants that include external validation across health systems, refinement of risk stratification and clinical trajectory models, and brief preventive interventions to enhance resilience in those at risk. Supported by a solid foundation in psychiatric and genetic epidemiology and a multidisciplinary team of world-class experts in an ideal environment, the candidate will acquire new expertise in predictive analytics, biomedical informatics (specifically EHR-exposome-genome integration), adolescent depression and prevention science through intensive mentored research and supervised training and professional development activities. This Award will provide the necessary training for the candidate to develop into a fully independent clinically informed investigator with a translational research program that bridges data science, statistical genetics, and developmental epidemiology to inform actionable strategies for early depression prevention and resilience promotion. PROJECT NARRATIVE Leveraging large-scale, readily available electronic health records data from existing routine workflows represents a powerful, untapped opportunity to enhance prevention through the systematic identification of young people at elevated risk of depression. Even a modest improvement in our ability to prospectively stratify risk of adolescent depression at a health systems level could be useful given its prevalence, the current lack of prospective tools that can be implemented at scale, and low burden of potential preventive strategies.","Integrating Health Records, Genomic, and Social Data to Stratify Adolescent Depression Risk",10284131,K08MH127413,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Body mass index', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guide prevention', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'bridge program', 'brief prevention intervention', 'career', 'child depression', 'cohort', 'depression prevention', 'depressive symptoms', 'deprivation', 'design', 'disability', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genomic data', 'health care service utilization', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'non-genomic', 'novel', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'research study', 'resilience', 'risk stratification', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social genomics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'stress related disorder', 'substance use', 'suicidal behavior', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'translational research program', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2021,197704
"Neurotrophic Factor Signaling in the Pathogenesis of HIV-associated Depression: Cohort and Mechanistic Studies Abstract Neurotrophic Factor Signaling in the Pathogenesis of HIV-associated Depression: Cohort and Mechanistic Studies Depression in people with HIV is known to worsen HIV outcomes as well as quality of life. Prior studies have shown Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is pivotal in neuron development and maintenance and important in depression. To better understand the pathophysiology of depression in HIV, we desire to use proteomics to further study the BDNF pathways in pre- existing CSF samples from people with HIV and then do a proof-of-concept test in a murine HIV model of depression. We have access to cerebrospinal fluid from a cohort of outpatients with HIV collected in a study of HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorders with CSF and clinical data collection at 0 and 2 years. The evaluation included neurocognitive testing and depression screening with the center for epidemiological studies depression (CESD). We plan to do discovery and validation proteomics with focus in the validation proteomics for the BDNF pathway. We will use a machine-learning analysis plan comparing our proteomics findings with the CESD generally and on an item-level basis as well as cognitive evaluations using the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs with focus on Loss, Reward Valuation, and Cognition. We plan to do this analysis first cross-sectionally and then further validate by comparing longitudinally. We hypothesize CSF neurotrophic factor BDNF with neuroinflammatory markers are associated with depressive symptoms; strength of association with depressive symptoms will vary within RDoC domains with persistent neuroinflammation closely tied to ongoing symptoms. We plan to use our findings from proteomics in an HIV murine model of depression with focus on the BDNF pathways. We plan to acquire humanized mice and infect half with HIV. We will evaluate them for depression and then inject half with a BDNF antagonist and evaluate again with standard depression testing. We hypothesize the treated mice to exhibit more signs of depression than untreated mice (less sucrose preference, less social interaction, less immobile time) as BDNF improves resilience and neuroplasticity. Successful completion will yield impactful data on the BDNF pathways and could discover additional targets for treatment of HIV-associated depression. Project Narrative Depression in people with HIV is highly prevalent and causes worse outcomes. We desire to explore the mechanism of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Peptide and related pathways in HIV- associated depression using the RDoC constructs with proteomics and a mouse model. We will do this using CSF samples from an outpatient Ugandan cohort with HIV as well as humanized mice with HIV as proof-of-concept.",Neurotrophic Factor Signaling in the Pathogenesis of HIV-associated Depression: Cohort and Mechanistic Studies,10369264,R21MH128839,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Body Fluids', 'Brain', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression screen', 'Disease Pathway', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infusion procedures', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mental Depression', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type 2', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Sterility', 'Sucrose', 'Symptoms', 'Tail Suspension', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'case control', 'cohort', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'humanized mouse', 'immune reconstitution', 'improved', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuron development', 'neurotrophic factor', 'preference', 'protein expression', 'psychosocial', 'receptor', 'resilience', 'response', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment adherence']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2021,195616
"Immunometabolicgene expression profiles associated with depressed mood and behavioral domains inpeople with HIV SUMMARY This project will leverage emerging knowledge about the role of immunometabolism in the pathophysiology of depression in people with HIV to generate hypotheses about potential future treatments. Depression in PWH is characterized by features that differentiate it from depression in people without HIV (PWoH). The first is the predominance of anhedonia - inability to gain enjoyment from activities. The second is a higher prevalence of depression that is resistant to treatment with standard antidepressant drugs in PWH versus PWoH. These clinical observations suggest not only that the underlying pathophysiology of depression is different between the two populations, but that different treatments are needed to successfully treat depression in PWH. Molecular studies of immunometabolism, defined as reciprocal interactions between immunity and metabolism that are dysregulated and linked to depression in PWH, support these distinctions. Based on our preliminary data and that in the literature, we propose to perform RNA-Seq transcriptomics, relating immunometabolic gene expression to protein and other biomarkers of immunometabolism, and to clinical depression as well as to cognitive processes impacted by depression. Our hypothesis-driven approach will focus on two interacting, co-regulated gene pathways central to depression and immunometabolism, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the NLRP3 inflammasome. We will study 80 newly recruited PWH and 40 age- matched PWoH. Given our early work suggesting that the relationship between immunometabolism and depression is sex-dependent, we aim for a 50/50 breakdown of men and premenopausal women in order to examine sex differences in these relationships. To optimize the spectrum of depressive symptom severity in our sample (e.g., avoid over-representation of individuals with minimal depressive symptoms), we will stratify with a 50/50 breakdown above and below the previously established Beck Depression Inventory-II cut-score for clinically-significant depressive symptoms (≥16). Since clinical studies cannot rigorously establish mechanistic relationships, we will study in parallel the roles of mTOR and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in depression-like behaviors in a mouse model of HIV infection, EcoHIV, which expresses seven of nine key human HIV proteins. These pathways will be dissected using mTOR and NLRP3 inhibitors. Also, in these animals we will characterize immunometabolic markers in brain tissue, presumably the substrate of depression. NARRATIVE Depression remains common in people with HIV (PWH) despite viral suppression; it has important adverse consequences including poor engagement in HIV care and poor health-related quality of life, and it is often treatment resistant. We will characterize specific gene pathways relevant to depression, potentially leading to future treatments for depression in PWH.",Immunometabolicgene expression profiles associated with depressed mood and behavioral domains inpeople with HIV,10369973,R01MH128869,"['Abbreviations', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Beck depression inventory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Epidemic', 'Estradiol', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolism', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Premenopause', 'Proteins', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testosterone', 'Translational Research', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biological research', 'brain tissue', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive process', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'immune function', 'inflammatory marker', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'juvenile animal', 'male', 'marenostrin', 'men', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'neurobehavior', 'protein expression', 'recruit', 'sex', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach', 'virology']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,786497
"The Neuroimmunology of Depression in Women Living With HIV PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In response to RFA-DA-21-116, “Mood Disorders in People Living with HIV: Mechanisms and Pathways”, we propose to investigate neuroimmunological and reward functions to study comorbid depression in women living with HIV (WLWH), a group heavily impacted by depression and its health consequences, yet underrepresented in HIV research. The proposed research will build upon the established Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)/Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) (Dr. Sharma, MPI of Bronx MWCCS) and its unique cohort of phenotypically well-characterized women with and without HIV. Our proposed model is: (1) HIV infection induces systemic inflammation (cytokines, kynurenines); (2) systemic inflammation extends to the CNS inducing oxidative stress [↓glutathione (GSH, antioxidant)] and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, major inhibitory neurotransmitter) deficits; (3) such neurochemical changes alter the reward circuitry, which contribute to the high prevalence of depression in WLWH. In support of this model, our immunological work in the WIHS found increased kynurenine pathway (KP) activity in WLWH compared to women without HIV, and among WLWH, KP activity was higher in WLWH with depression. In our depression non-HIV research, we found that anhedonia–a core symptom of depression reflecting reward deficits–was associated with worse depression outcomes, including chronicity and suicidality. To better delineate reward circuitry, we identified distinct resting-state network features associated with depression and anhedonia using striatal-based intrinsic functional connectivity and whole-brain parcellation data-driven graph theory analysis. We additionally utilized the reward flanker (RFT) and reward prediction error (RPET) fMRI tasks to examine distinct brain activity during reward anticipation, attainment, and prediction errors, which predicted future depression severity. Utilizing proton MR spectroscopy, we showed that anhedonia accounted for decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA levels in adolescent depression, and moreover, we documented inverse relationships between cortical GSH and anhedonia severity in depressed adults. Furthermore, we reported associations between circulatory cytokines and kynurenines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry in youth. Extending our compelling findings, we will now test the overall hypothesis that WLWH exhibit increased systemic and CNS inflammation, which leads to reward dysfunction and subsequently depression. We will utilize a 2×2 factorial design: 1) 100 depressed WLWH; 2) 100 non-depressed WLWH; 3) 50 depressed HIV negative women; and 4) 50 non-depressed HIV- negative women. Participants will have comprehensive evaluations at baseline, 6- and 12-months assessing depression, reward, anxiety, trauma, HIV treatment, CD4+ count, and VL. F-MRI (resting-state, RFT, RPET), 1H MRS (GABA, GSH), a reward computerized task and cognitive tests will be done at baseline.  PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to investigate neuroimmunological and reward functions to study comorbid depression in women living with HIV (WLWH), a group heavily impacted by depression and its health consequences yet underrepresented in HIV research. This collaborative proposal bridges disciplines of depression, neuroimaging, HIV, and metabolomics in an effort to improve our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying depression in WLWH and has the potential to improve overall and mental health outcomes in this highly vulnerable group.",The Neuroimmunology of Depression in Women Living With HIV,10370113,R01MH128878,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Antioxidants', 'Anxiety', 'Brain', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glutathione', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Immune', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Inflammation', 'Infrastructure', 'Kynurenine', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Menopausal Status', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Protons', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study', 'Thick', 'Trauma', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Interagency HIV Study', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavioral construct', 'causal model', 'cell type', 'child depression', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comorbid depression', 'computerized', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'graph theory', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'macrophage', 'metabolomics', 'monocyte', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuromechanism', 'nicotine use', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'reward circuitry', 'subthreshold depression', 'symptom cluster', 'systemic inflammatory response']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,809253
