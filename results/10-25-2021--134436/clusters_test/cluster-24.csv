"Physical, Social, and Economic Environments and Firearm Fatalities among Youth Project Summary / Abstract (30 lines) As a social epidemiologist and junior faculty member at UC Davis, my career goal is to build a program of research that identifies fundamental causes of violence and its determinants, and to use this understanding to test effective approaches to reduce violence-related harm. The relationship between neighborhood-level characteristics and firearm violence is well recognized. However, these multiple exposures likely operate in complex and reciprocal ways with each other and with crime and violence that are not yet well understood. Therefore, I propose to take advantage of an existing dataset built for an ongoing study of demolition and rehabilitation of decaying properties in Cleveland, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan, for which I am the principal investigator, to describe the range of neighborhood-level exposures in each of these cities and to identify how these exposures work together to impact firearm violence. These objectives will be accomplished through three specific aims: Aim 1: To describe variation in classes of neighborhood interventions across neighborhoods and neighborhood characteristics in Cleveland, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan from 2010 through 2019; Aim 2: to identify the neighborhood-level exposures that are most predictive of high levels of neighborhood youth firearm violence; and Aim 3: to estimate effects of individual neighborhood interventions and classes of neighborhood interventions on rates of neighborhood violent crime, firearm-related crime, firearm homicides, and firearm suicides among youth and young adults age 10 to 29. I will use detailed datasets primarily built from parcel- level administrative data in each city in order to accomplish the aims of the proposed study. These datasets use micro-data to describe neighborhood characteristics such as home quality, foreclosure rates, land use type, and vacancies. These micro-data are coupled with census variables on demographics, education levels, and other socioeconomic indicators and are aggregated to census tracts. We also undertook a thorough and systematic review of programs and policies hypothesized to influence violence prevention, either directly (e.g. changes in policing strategies) or indirectly (e.g. incentives to encourage buying homes in specific neighborhoods) and critical events, defined as expected and unexpected shocks to the cities, over the study period (2010-2019). These interventions and events are mapped to specific locations and dates. I will use a range of rigorous statistical methods, including latent class analysis, ensemble machine learning and causal inference methods, and spatial analysis methods to accomplish the study aims. I have identified three critical areas where continued training will prepare me to pursue my career goals and make important contributions to the field of violence prevention. These include training in 1) spatial analysis, 2) criminology and criminal justice theory, and 3) the analysis of multiple, correlated exposures. The experience gained through the proposed program of study will help me develop the skills, understanding, and experience I need to succeed in my career goals and allow me to answer critical questions on neighborhood exposures and youth firearm violence. Project Narrative (3 sentences) While the relationship between neighborhood-level characteristics and firearm violence is well recognized, very little is known about the relative importance and joint effects of the multiple and dynamic exposures that make up the neighborhood environment. Describing the range of exposures and their relative importance in predicting youth firearm violence, as well as the independent and joint effects of these exposures on firearm violence is critical for developing a deeper understanding of how “place” affects violence. Investigation of the environmental causes of firearm violence may illuminate broad-based interventions with a greater ability to achieve widespread and lasting impacts.","Physical, Social, and Economic Environments and Firearm Fatalities among Youth",10268953,K01CE003224,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,K01,2021,124119
"ICEES+ Knowledge Provider: Leveraging Open Clinical and Environmental Data to Accelerate and Drive Innovation in Translational Research and Clinical Care. As part of the feasibility phase of the Translator program, we have developed a disease-agnostic framework and approach for openly exposing clinical data that have been integrated at the patient- and visit-level with environmental exposures data: the Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service (ICEES). We have validated ICEES and demonstrated the service’s ability to replicate and extend published findings on asthma, while also supporting open team science, accelerated translational discovery, and integration with the broader Translator ecosystem. This proposal aims to move ICEES from prototype to development via creation of an ICEES+ Knowledge Provider (KP). Specifically, we aim to address three major challenges that we have identified through research and development (R&D) of the prototype ICEES in an effort to improve the quality, value, and impact of query answers and assertions. Specific Aim 1. Advance the rigor of insights and assertions that ICEES provides. Our prototype ICEES currently provides the ability to dynamically define cohorts and conduct simple statistical associations to examine bivariate relationships between feature variables. Recently, we have identified an approach to extend the bivariate functionalities to support multivariate analysis of the data. For the proposed work, we will apply multivariate analyses, including traditional statistical methods (e.g., regression models) and machine learning methods (e.g., bayesian neural network models, variational autoencoder models), and systematically quantify the extent of data loss and analytic bounds when algorithms are imposed on the ICEES+ KP open application programming interface (API) versus the Institutional Review Board (IRB)– protected, fully identified, pre-binned, underlying integrated feature tables. The overall goal is to provide users with more rigorous insights and estimates of the robustness, validity, accuracy, and specificity of knowledge and assertions generated via the ICEES+ KP OpenAPI. Specific Aim 2. Address issues related to space–time and causality. Clinical and environmental data are inherently spatiotemporal, with observations or events that are contingent on space and time and may be causally related. For the proposed work, we will evaluate and implement technical approaches (e.g., ICEES+ design modifications), spatiotemporal statistical algorithms (e.g., conditional auto-regression), recurrent neural network models, and causal inference models. As part of this effort, we will derive insights from and contribute real-world evidence to support Causal Activity Models and Adverse Outcome Pathways. We also will explore approaches for incorporating into ICEES+ nationwide public data on school exposures—data that will allow us to begin to address patient mobility. Specific Aim 3. Evaluate the security of the ICEES+ KP to ensure that patient privacy is preserved as new capabilities are enabled. ImPACT is an NSF-funded package of tools and services that provides end-to-end infrastructure and support for privacy-assured research and computation on sensitive data. Over the award period, we will implement and evaluate ImPACT security protocols, focusing initially on application of the ImPACT secure multiparty computation (SMC) algorithm as a method to support secure multi-institutional sharing of data on rare diseases and events—a functionality that is not currently supported by ICEES. In addition, we will evaluate other ImPACT security protocols, working under the guidance of a security advisor and in the context of driving use cases and capabilities developed under Specific Aims1 and 2. Importantly, the project aims will be driven by three use cases and associated high-value queries designed to complement and extend our asthma-focused work on the prototype ICEES: (1) an asthma cohort from the Environmental Polymorphism Registry (EPR) at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS); (2) a primary ciliary disease cohort (PCD) from the UNC PCD Registry; and (3) a drug-induced liver injury (DILI) cohort from the National DILI Network. These use cases will invoke new diseases, new data types, new organ systems, new institutions, and new queries, thereby stress-testing the ICEES framework and approach and moving it from prototype to development as the ICEES+ KP. n/a",ICEES+ Knowledge Provider: Leveraging Open Clinical and Environmental Data to Accelerate and Drive Innovation in Translational Research and Clinical Care.,10333478,OT2TR003430,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Bayesian neural network', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress Tests', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'application programming interface', 'autoencoder', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'liver injury', 'machine learning method', 'patient mobility', 'patient privacy', 'preservation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NCATS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,OT2,2021,982187
"Using computer vision and deep learning to measure worker kinematics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are among the most frequent and costly nonfatal work-related injuries and illnesses across virtually all US industry sectors. Responding to the clear need emphasized in the NIOSH National Research Agenda for Musculoskeletal Health to develop improved methods of estimating exposure to occupational risk factors for MSDs, this research will validate new software for measuring worker postures and movements using only standard video as input. The software leverages major advances in computer vision and machine learning sciences that only recently have enabled measurement of human postures in three dimensional space using standard two dimensional video or image sources. Ultimately, one of our long-term goals is to develop applications for occupational safety and health practitioners analogous to widely-used direct reading instruments for assessing exposure to occupational hazards (e.g., sound pressure meters and gas monitors). In this initial R21, we propose to validate the postural data our software produces (Aim 1) and examine agreement between postural information output by our software and that output by more traditional (but time-consuming) observation-based video analyses (Aim 2). In Aim 1, participants will perform a repetitive, arm-intensive task involving reaching to and manipulating knobs mounted to a fixture located in front of the body. We will then estimate the accuracy of neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, trunk, and knee angular displacements (i.e., posture over time) measured by our software, compared to data simultaneously collected using an optical motion capture system. Experimental variables include the range of motion required of participants to perform the task and the configuration of the camera used to record video of participants during the task. Results from Aim 1 will provide critical information about the performance of our new software needed to inform best-practices for implementation in field-capable exposure assessment applications. In Aim 2, we will reanalyze >1000 workplace videos obtained during the course of a previous prospective study of upper extremity MSDs among manufacturing workers. Analyses are proposed to assess the inter-method agreement between automated video analyses (our software) and analyses completed by trained specialist observers during the course of the prospective study. Results will provide evidence that our software can quantify occupational exposure to MSD risk factors at a fraction of time needed to perform commonly used observation- based analyses. The reanalysis of existing workplace videos can also open new pathways to explore associations between occupational exposures to MSD risk factors and incident health outcomes in future studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are among the most frequent and costly of all nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses, across virtually all US industry sectors. Responding to a clear need to develop improved methods of estimating exposure to occupational risk factors for MSDs, this research will validate a new computer vision-based method of measuring worker postures and movements using only standard video as input. The results will provide flexible platform upon which to build practical applications to support the efforts of occupational safety and health professionals in protecting the health of our nation's workforce.",Using computer vision and deep learning to measure worker kinematics,10214134,R21OH011911,[' '],NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2021,201161
"Developing data science solutions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change in Africa: the HE2AT Center HE2AT Center Overall - Project summary/abstract The world's climate is changing rapidly, with global temperatures having risen more than 1°C since the industrial revolution, and a further 0.5°C increase is likely by 2040. Heat waves and rising temperatures have major, though underappreciated, health implications, particularly for vulnerable populations in low-income settings. The overarching objective of the Heat and Health African Transdisciplinary Center (HE2AT Center) is to develop innovative solutions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change in Africa. The consortium of academic and non-academic partners is drawn from across sub-Saharan Africa and from the United States, and constitutes a transdisciplinary group, including heat physiologists, biomedical and climate content experts, public health practitioners, social-behavioral scientists as well as statisticians, and computer and data scientists. The Center will systematically develop a data ecosystem containing biomedical data, integrated with weather, air quality and other environmental data, and other geospatial data within two existing highly- complementary data platforms (IBM-PAIRS and the University of Cape Town). Over five years we will implement two Research Projects and 10-12 Pilot Projects, all streamlined and supported by the Administration, Data Management and Analysis, and Training and Engagement Cores. The first Project will implement an innovative data science approach to characterize the clinical outcomes of heat exposure in pregnant women and neonates. We will reuse data from cohorts and trials among pregnant women and neonates conducted across sub-Saharan Africa since the year 2000. Data from systematically identified studies will be integrated in an Individual Participant Data platform from data repositories and data owners. Then, analyses of relationships between heat exposure and outcomes (preterm birth, birth weight and pre- eclampsia) will inform quantification of heat-related disease burden. Finally, taking all findings together, we will pilot a district-level climate change indicator, the first of its kind. The second Project assesses the burden of heat-related morbidity in vulnerable urban settings using geospatial and heat hazard analyses in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire and Johannesburg, South Africa. This Project uses more complex data and data sources on the built environment and topography, for example, to assess heat-health impacts, and how these vary across urban geographies. Activities will inform development of an Early Warning System, including a digital App that delivers information to people on their forecasted risks of heat-health disease, based on their individualized risk profile, as determined by a machine learning algorithm which takes into account weather conditions, individual characteristics, geolocation and other factors that drive risk. These systems are a central element in heatwave responses, allow for adequate preparations for heat events, which is especially important for vulnerable groups and industry. We will collaborate closely with other Hubs and parts of the DS-I Africa consortium, supporting them to incorporate climate data within their research activities, and vice versa. HE2AT Center Overall - Project Narrative The Heat and Health African Transdisciplinary Center (HE2AT Center) will generate new knowledge on the impacts of heat waves and extreme heat on clinical conditions and on people living in vulnerable urban settings, applying data sciences approaches to existing environmental and high-quality health outcomes data. Perhaps more importantly, the Center will develop and test innovative solutions for tracking heat-related conditions at a district level and for providing individualized early warnings of dangerous heat periods relevant to high-risk groups, industry and the general population. In all Center activities we will build capacity of the team and key organizations, engage with communities, government and other stakeholder, and work across the DS-I Africa Program.",Developing data science solutions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change in Africa: the HE2AT Center,10314149,U54TW012083,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'African', 'Air', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Birth Weight', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Climate', 'Climatology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heat Waves', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Influentials', 'Institution', 'Ivory Coast', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pilot Projects', 'Planets', 'Policies', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Preparation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Priority', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Social Sciences', 'Software Design', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'climate change', 'climate data', 'climate impact', 'cohort', 'complex data', 'computer science', 'data ecosystem', 'data management', 'data repository', 'data reuse', 'digital', 'doctoral student', 'extreme heat', 'global temperature', 'hazard', 'health data', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'maternal outcome', 'mortality', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonate', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'social', 'statistics', 'urban area', 'urban setting']",FIC,"WITS HEALTH CONSORTIUM (PTY), LTD",U54,2021,899982
"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops.

"Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) Our objective is to provide an unparalleled, centralized, publicly available resource with comprehensive, expertly annotated data, and analysis tools that informs design and interpretation of environmental health studies and promotes novel insights into the etiologies of environmentally influenced diseases. Most human diseases involve interactions between genetic and environmental factors. The environment is implicated in many common conditions such as asthma, cancer, and diabetes; however, the etiology of these widespread diseases remains unclear. More than 80,000 chemicals are currently used in commerce, challenging elucidation about chemical mechanisms of action and prioritization of environmental research. Integration of diverse data with novel analysis approaches is required to understand environment- disease associations and is essential for improving toxicity prediction, risk assessment, regulation and development of effective therapeutic interventions. We developed the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctdbase.org) to enhance understanding about environment-disease connections by providing manually curated data describing chemical-gene interactions and chemical- and gene-disease relationships from the peer-reviewed literature and integrating these data with select external data sets (e.g., pathways and biological process data) and novel data analysis tools. Since its initial public release in 2004, CTD has become a well-established resource with a strong and expanding user base. This competitive renewal proposes to leverage and enhance the existing CTD framework, and continue our tradition of responding to the evolving needs of the environmental health research community by a) increasing the depth of content through comprehensive curation of our “core” (chemical-gene/protein-disease) and exposure data, b) incorporating select public data sets to augment mechanism-based environmental health analyses, and c) developing and integrating novel analytical and visualization tools. These additions will significantly increase the impact of CTD on environmental health research by centralizing, harmonizing, and contextualizing information required to understand the complex relationships between diverse exposures and environmentally influenced diseases. Despite the thousands of chemicals used in commerce, our understanding of their effects on human health is not well understood. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a unique, publicly available resource that provides information about human exposures and how these exposures influence our genes, our biology, and ultimately our health. This project will build on our established infrastructure to expand the data content and analysis capabilities of CTD to provide new insights into the complex relationship between our environment and human diseases.",Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD),10188530,R01ES014065,"['Affect', 'Asthma', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Chemicals', 'Commerce', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk Assessment', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Widespread Disease', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'comparative', 'design', 'diverse data', 'exposed human population', 'gene interaction', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'source localization', 'text searching', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool']",NIEHS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2021,511900
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,10213030,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Arginine', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biogenesis', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Carbohydrates', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Health Professional', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Pathway', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Optic Nerve', 'Ornithine', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plasma', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'case control', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'dietary restriction', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'time interval', 'trait']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,530499
"Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this, PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project 2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system. Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000 data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report- back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reproductive health has been at the forefront of Puerto Ricans’ health concerns as rates of preterm birth and infant mortality in Puerto Rico are among the highest of all U.S. states and territories. The PROTECT SRC is exploring the link between exposure to a mixture of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Puerto Rico, and is working to reduce that exposure. Improved understanding of the link between adverse pregnancy outcomes and contamination, together with developing sustainable technologies to reduce risk, will help improve health outcomes in Puerto Rico (a disadvantaged population) and beyond.",Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT),10128453,P42ES017198,"['Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Floods', 'Geographic state', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Hurricane', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxidative Stress Pathway', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pesticides', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health Practice', 'Puerto Rican', 'Puerto Rico', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Superfund', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Water', 'Water Purification', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'community engagement', 'community involvement', 'contaminant transport', 'contaminated drinking water', 'contaminated water', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data repository', 'data visualization', 'disadvantaged population', 'drinking water', 'experience', 'extreme weather', 'ground water', 'health data', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'new technology', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'portability', 'prenatal', 'recruit', 'remediation', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'superfund chemical', 'superfund site', 'tissue culture', 'toxicant', 'volatile organic compound', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,P42,2021,2152873
"Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex Project Summary Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) affects nearly one in four adults in the United States. With recent discov- eries pertaining to cochlear synaptopathy and outer hair cell (OHC) loss in the extended high frequencies, it is clear that much of the early NIHL remains `hidden' under traditional audiological scrutiny. Without early de- tection and intervention, such damage can progress into more severe hearing loss. Thus a critical window for therapeutics/lifestyle changes may go unutilized. However, there are currently no feasible tools that can identify early hearing damage. Prior studies that test the integrity of the auditory afferent pathway have not produced conclusive results. However, short- and long-term noise exposure-related peripheral damage are correlated with changes in the auditory efferent system. Speciﬁcally, hyperactivity in the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and threshold elevation of the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR) have been reported. Given the protective roles of the MOCR and the MEMR through inhibition of peripheral inputs, and their differential changes with damage, we argue that a combined assay of MOCR and MEMR may serve as a marker for early hearing damage in humans.  Using a novel otoacoustic emission (OAE)-based efferent assay, in the proposed studies we aim to (1) eval- uate long-term age-speciﬁc changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure and (2) evaluate short-term changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure. We will investigate the concurrent working of the two reﬂexes across a wide age range (18-50 years) and noise exposure by recruiting individuals from high noise exposure (musicians, veterans, construction workers, farmer) and low noise exposure occupa- tions (students, professors). To evaluate short-term changes due to noise exposure, we will test participants before and after their typical work day. For reliable exposure stratiﬁcation, noise exposure will be objectively quantiﬁed using 5-day sound dosimetry. We will also use the most sensitive afferent measures to allow compari- son with efferent measures. Machine learning approaches will be employed to ascertain relationships among the cochlear, afferent, and efferent function for short- and long-term noise exposures.  Findings from project 1 will reveal if the combined MOCR and MEMR metrics can delineate noise exposure effects from aging, and highlight the relationships among cochlear, afferent, and efferent measures. Findings from project 2 will reveal if long-term noise exposure predicts short-term changes following noise exposure and vice- versa. A better understanding of short- and long-term changes in the auditory system following noise exposure will aid in the development of (1) an objective rapid screening test of the auditory efferents capable of detecting noise exposure-related hearing damage and (2) a statistical model to enable predicting impending damage based on efferent function. Together, these tools will contribute to early detection and promote hearing conservation. Project Narrative This study will investigate the role of the auditory efferents, the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR), in short- and long-term noise exposure-related changes in the auditory system. Additionally, statistical models will be developed to understand the relationship between efferent and afferent candidate measures of hearing damage. The outcomes of this study will lay the foundation for a screening test of early hearing damage based on the integrity of the auditory efferent system.",Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex,10204332,R21DC018108,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Afferent Pathways', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain Stem', 'Clinical', 'Cochlea', 'Cohort Studies', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Protection', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Hyperactivity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Legal patent', 'Life Style', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Noise-Induced Hearing Loss', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outcome Study', 'Outer Hair Cells', 'Participant', 'Peripheral', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rapid screening', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Students', 'System', 'Temporary Threshold Shift', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age group', 'age related', 'base', 'clinically translatable', 'cochlear synaptopathy', 'conditioning', 'demographics', 'dosimetry', 'ear muscle', 'farmer', 'hearing impairment', 'middle ear', 'musician', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'professor', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'sound', 'therapeutic lifestyle change', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2021,155333
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"CHABMAP (Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom Mapping and Analyses Platform) technology automates the quantification of toxic CyanoHABs exposure epochs for any waterbody. Specific Aim #1: Operationalize spatio-temporal CyanoHAB exposure epoch metrics  • Fuse multi-scale and disparate satellite remote sensing platforms and automate retrievals over  space and time to derive CyanoHAB exposure metrics. We will build enterprise software to fully  automate the harmonization and fusion of NASA’s Landsat-8 OLI and ESA’s Sentinel-2 and  Sentinel-3 satellite platforms to provide long-term (1984-present) moderate spatial resolution  (30meter pixels) and high temporal frequency CyanoHAB exposure metrics (Cyanobacteria  Intensity, Color Dissolved Organic Matter, Total Suspended Solids, Floating Algae Index,  Chlorophyll-a Concentration, & toxins). The decision support tool automates epoch synthesis to  understand incubation periods and exposure triggers for neurodegenerative diseases. Specific Aim #2: Scale on-demand CHABMAP commercial product services  • Scale and implement CHABMAP data services for infinite scalability using BigData cloud  technologies. This Aim involves three main development efforts: adapting our proprietary  Geospatial Image and Processing System (GIPS) capabilities to an AWS-deployable auto-scaling  cluster, creation of user interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs) to interact with  these services, and enhancements to the base GIPS framework to facilitate intercommunication  between remote GIPS-enabled archives and the cloud processing streams. This includes the  creation of deployable compute instances, optimization of computation and parallelization  specific to AWS deployment, optimization of temporary and long-term storage of intermediate  products, and optimization of communication and data transfer with end users. Ultimately, this  Aim will allow for the assessment and monitoring of CyanoHAB conditions for any waterbody or  region (i.e., North America) on the planet. Specific Aim #3: Execute risk assessment frameworks with public health partners  • We will work in partnership with Cleveland Clinic, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center,  University of Miami, Macquarie University, NIH’s Neuromuscular Diseases Research Section and  CDC’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (National ALS Registry) to assess the role  of CyanoHABs exposure as a risk factor for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using patients,  clinic-, and population-based controls across diverse settings and geographies. Each application  end user has ongoing risk assessment frameworks (i.e., Gene-Environment, Residential History  Machine Learning, eco-epidemiological, molecular biology) which our CHABMAP technology will  integrate exposure epoch metrics to understand the etiology or ALS and support drug discovery. Proposed Innovation CHABMAP technology automates the quantification of toxic Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom (CHAB) exposure epochs for any waterbody or catchment in the world for the past four decades using multi-scale harmonized satellites. We use custom and proprietary techniques combined with BigData software to generate historical exposure (“exposome”) profiles as well provide Decision Support Tools services for CHAB monitoring in near-real time. During Phase 2 and beyond we work with world experts to integrate our commercial products and services into neurodegenerative disease Gene-Environment (GxE) risk assessment frameworks. Proposed Products, Services, Outcomes  • Develop historical CHAB exposure measurements working with environmental agency partners  • Assessment of CyanoHABs as a risk factor for ALS across multiple, independent study regions  • CHABMAP on-demand Analytics-as-a-Service platform operating at end of Phase 2  • Support discovery of etiology and drug development for neurological disorders and diseases Project Narrative Design, build, and operate a cloud-based Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom Mapping and Analysis Platform (CHAB-MAP) for developing public health applications’ in partnership with NASA, EPA, and medical centers.

"An Agent-Based Modeling Platform for Environmental Biotechnology Hazardous pollutants in the environment continue to threaten public health and environmental  safety. Human exposure to major contaminant classes, such as polyfluorinated compounds  (PFCs), hazardous organic compounds (HOCs), and heavy metals, has been linked to a variety of  diseases and is subject to stringent State and Federal environmental regulations.  Bioremediation is a low-cost and environmentally friendly approach with many successful  use-cases; however, conventional bioremediation technologies can suffer from unreliability, low  degradation rates, and incomplete degradation. As stakeholders to Superfund sites and other sites  with water or soil pollution urgently demand more efficient, less costly and more reliable  remediation technologies, it is critical to look to advancements in computational  modeling to develop next-generation, precision-engineered bioremediation technologies. The proposed project builds on successful outcomes from Phase I in which a new computational  platform was designed and validated to accurately predict the bioremediation kinetics of  a multi-organism microcosm degrading a combination of HOCs in groundwater. The basis of  this platform is an approach called agent-based modeling (ABM), where the functions of  individual components (e.g. microorganisms) within complex ecosystems are used to predict and  optimize system-level properties (e.g. bioremediation kinetics). In this Phase II project, the novel computational platform developed in Phase I is  further improved with a machine learning component that leverages bioinformatics  databases to develop rationally tailored microbiomes for degrading complex pollutant  mixtures. Iterative experimental validation of model outputs is conducted using an innovative  materials science platform that maintains the relative concentration of different species in the  microbiome constant within the multi-zone treatment barrier (in-situ) or multi-zone bioreactor  (ex-situ). The project includes focused development of a prototype for one bioremediation use-case,  which is directly compared to a conventional (non-precision) bioremediation system treating   actual contaminated groundwater. This will be performed in order to assess and quantify  the expected technical and economic benefits of harnessing the project's novel computational  platform in biotechnology development. The broad, long-term impact of the proposed project will be to transform the development and  implementation of bioremediation by integrating advancements in computational modeling, machine  learning, bioinformatics, and materials science. By leveraging novel tools across disciplines, the  project will accelerate the development of more precise, reliable and inexpensive technologies for  environmental remediation. The successful outcome of the proposed project will also provide new  collaborative opportunities for industry and academia to more rapidly address the remediation of  high-priority pollutants in the environment, and ultimately help mitigate the effects of hazardous  pollutants on communities impacted by the presence of environmental contamination. PROJECT NARRATIVE Contaminated soils and waters continue to threaten public health and safety.

"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",10226996,R01ES027747,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cadmium', 'Carbon', 'Carbon Black', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Membrane', 'Mercury', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Nitrates', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'RNA marker', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suggestion', 'Sulfate', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Trace Elements', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vesicle', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'ambient air pollution', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fine particles', 'follow-up', 'inflammatory marker', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2021,725749
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,10250303,R00ES028743,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Wind', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'indexing', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R00,2021,249003
"BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES,10304211,R01ES028819,"['Address', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Architecture', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Censuses', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Cox Models', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'North Carolina', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Ozone', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pollution', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Siblings', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Sulfur Dioxide', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'early childhood', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'indexing', 'lead exposure', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'pollutant', 'programs', 'rural environment', 'simulation', 'social', 'social stress', 'social stressor', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'urban setting', 'web site']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2021,487253
"A preconception cohort study of air pollution, fertility, and miscarriage ABSTRACT Infertility and spontaneous abortion (SAB) are significant public health problems, each affecting up to 20% of reproductive-aged couples in the United States. As couples increasingly postpone childbearing to the later reproductive years, many seek infertility treatment, which has relatively low success rates, costs an estimated $5 billion per year, and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, identifying modifiable risk factors for subfertility and SAB is an important public health goal. The potential effects of air pollution on risk of subfertility and SAB are understudied. The few existing human studies have major limitations including retrospective study design, small study size, suboptimal assessment of exposure and outcome, inadequate control for potential confounding variables, and limited generalizability. The proposed study will assess the relation of several air pollutants to risk of subfertility and SAB in two interrelated preconception prospective cohort studies in North America and Denmark. Using web-based recruitment, data collection, and follow-up, we have enrolled over 16,500 women attempting pregnancy, collectively comprising the largest preconception cohort study ever conducted on factors related to fertility and SAB. We have collected prospective data on time-to- pregnancy, SAB, potential confounders in both partners, and residential addresses at baseline and on bi-monthly follow-up questionnaires for all participants, providing the foundation for accurate time-varying assessment of exposure to air pollution throughout the preconception and early pregnancy periods. Our specific aims are to develop spatio-temporal models of ambient PM2.5, NO2, and O3 for the etiologic time periods of interest, construct measures of traffic and roadway density around each residence using geographic information system software, and assign appropriate time-varying estimates of exposure. Among 18,500 women, we will examine the association between individual measures of air pollution (PM2.5, NO2, O3 and measures of traffic density) and fecundability, the cycle-specific probability of conception. We will evaluate the same measures of air pollution with risk of SAB. We will also utilize state-of-the-art statistical methods, including predictive k-means clustering, to examine the effects of pollutant mixtures, with an emphasis on speciation of PM components. Strengths of this application include its large study size, preconception enrollment of a geographically and ethnically diverse cohort of pregnancy planners, assessment of repeated measures of exposure during the preconception and early pregnancy periods, excellent control for individual-level and neighborhood-level confounding via collection of data on a wide range of covariates, and the use of multi-pollutant modeling techniques. The present application is cost-effective in leveraging already-established cohort studies funded by the NICHD. The proposed study addresses novel and important reproductive health outcomes that have had only limited study in relation to air pollution. Study results are likely to inform primary prevention of infertility and SAB, and add to evidence used by regulators to improve air quality. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nearly 15% of all couples have difficulty becoming pregnant and approximately 20% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. Despite their frequent occurrence, few factors have been firmly linked to an increased risk of infertility and miscarriage. Identifying modifiable risk factors for infertility and miscarriage, such as air pollution, is an important public health goal, especially because medical treatments for these conditions are costly, have relatively low success rates, and may increase the risk of health problems to mother and child.","A preconception cohort study of air pollution, fertility, and miscarriage",10124393,R01ES028923,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Conceptions', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Denmark', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fertility', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Grant', 'Gravid', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'North America', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Ozone', 'Participant', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pollution', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy loss', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Primary Prevention', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Unsafe Sex', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'child bearing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost estimate', 'density', 'early pregnancy', 'ethnic diversity', 'fine particles', 'follow-up', 'health goals', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infertility treatment', 'insight', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'particle', 'pollutant', 'pregnant', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'residence', 'software systems', 'spatiotemporal', 'stillbirth', 'subfertility', 'success', 'time-to-pregnancy', 'traffic-related air pollution']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,564468
"A preconception cohort study of environmental chemicals, fertility, and miscarriage ABSTRACT Infertility and spontaneous abortion (SAB) are significant public health problems, affecting up to 25% of reproductive age couples in the United States. Health care costs attributable to infertility and SAB exceed $5 billion per year, and several studies have shown an association between infertility treatments and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors for subfertility and SAB is an important public health goal. The potential effects of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on risk of subfertility and SAB are understudied. The few existing human studies have limitations including small sample size, enrollment after conception, retrospective study design, suboptimal assessment of exposure and outcome, inadequate control for potential confounding variables, and limited generalizability. The proposed study will prospectively assess the relation of exposure to selected EDCs, including phenols, phthalates, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), to risk of subfertility and SAB in a preconception subcohort of 950 pregnancy planners. We will use data from two NICHD-supported prospective cohorts of pregnancy planners in North America and Denmark. With web-based recruitment and data collection, we have enrolled over 17,000 women attempting pregnancy into these cohorts. In a subset of 200 participants, we have successfully pilot tested in-person collection of urine and blood specimens during the preconception and early pregnancy periods. In this application, we propose to expand in-person biospecimen collection, increasing the number of women with preconception and early pregnancy urine and blood samples from 200 to 950. At each of our three biospecimen collection sites (Boston, Detroit, and Aarhus), we will enroll 250 women and collect three urine samples and one blood sample (in preconception) and three urine samples and one blood sample (in early pregnancy). We will ship the samples to the CDC for the analysis of urinary phthalates, urinary phenols, and serum PFAS. To increase cost efficiency, we will pool three urine samples in each exposure window before assaying for phthalates and phenols; and we will assay one preconception blood specimen for PFAS, a persistent chemical, in analyses of subfertility and SAB. Finally, we will conduct a pilot study among 100 U.S. participants to assess the feasibility of collecting urine by mail, which would allow us to take advantage of our full geographically-diverse cohort in the future. Strengths of this application include the prospective design, preconception enrollment of pregnancy planners, repeated measurement of exposure during preconception and early pregnancy, excellent control for confounding via bimonthly prospective data collection on a wide range of covariates, and use of the latest analytic methods for mixtures modeling. We have generated compelling preliminary data to support our aims. The present grant is cost-effective in leveraging already-established cohort studies with data collection and follow-up supported by other grants. The results generated will be translatable by directly informing future regulatory decisions about EDC standards in a manner that could reduce rates of infertility and SAB. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nearly 15% of all couples have difficulty becoming pregnant and up to 25% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. Infertility and miscarriage can cause profound psychological and financial hardship for those affected, and they account for more than 5 billion dollars in U.S. health care costs each year.

"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development,10122959,F31ES030263,"['Address', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flame Retardants', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenols', 'Placenta', 'Plastics', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'consumer product', 'data management', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fundamental research', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple datasets', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'pollutant', 'polybrominated diphenyl ether', 'prenatal exposure', 'public health intervention', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2021,16342
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,10163057,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell proliferation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,642893
"Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater Project Summary / Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a naturally-occurring metal contaminant found in water supplies throughout the world. Although research using small samples (< 400 observations) from Bangladesh, China and Canada suggests that excessive consumption of Mn is neurotoxic in infants and young children, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classifies Mn only as a secondary contaminant. Thus, Mn is not subject to mandatory monitoring in public water systems, let alone private wells, which serve over 2 million Californians while remaining unregulated and untreated. To reconcile the gap between epidemiological evidence and regulatory action, we propose this timely research. Our project, which takes California’s private wells as a focal point for its investigation, has three specific aims: to identify (1) areas at high risk of exposure to Mn in drinking water (2) the socioeconomic characteristics of communities at high-risk of Mn exposure, and (3) the degree of association between Mn exposure and the health outcomes of infants and young children. While treatment for Mn-contaminated water is technologically straightforward, access may depend on a community’s socioeconomic and political status; thus, there is danger of Mn silently amplifying health inequalities. The ​broader, long-term objectives of this research are (I) to encourage further analyses of Mn exposure in California by developing a statewide publicly-available dataset from groundwater Mn data, and (II) to develop a ​causal ​framework for a primary-sample study of Mn effects on infant and child health. California enforces the US EPA’s secondary contaminant standard of 50 µg L​-1 but only in community water systems. Non-transient, non-community water systems (e.g. schools and hospitals) and private wells are exempt. In recent years, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has found Mn concentrations above the health-based target of 300 µg L​-1 in California’s wells. ​The proposed research will indicate whether and to what extent Mn affects child health and contributes to health disparities. As such, it is aligned with the NIEHS mission to determine how environmental exposures affect humans in order to promote healthier lives. To achieve the first aim of identifying areas at high risk of exposure to unsafe concentrations of Mn, we will use a machine learning model on subsurface flow and groundwater chemistry to predict Mn concentrations in the Central Valley, Los Angeles, Central Coast and West Coast Basins; then, we will overlay the Mn prediction grid with ZIP code and school district polygons to identify the areas that emerge with more than a 50% chance of exposure to Mn at the secondary standard as high-risk. For the second aim, we will determine if high-risk areas are distinguished from low-risk areas by their socioeconomic status and demographics using two-sample t-tests. For the third aim, we will run least squares regressions of birth weight, grade-by-school test scores and chronic absenteeism rates on predicted Mn exposure with controls for chemical confounds, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics. Project Narrative The impact of manganese (Mn) on population health is an under-investigated problem in the United States relative to the wide prevalence and frequent detections of the chemical above safe concentrations in groundwater basins throughout the country. In line with NIEHS priorities to better understand environmental health disparities and to aid in securing environmental justice, we propose to correct this knowledge gap by undertaking a substantial investigation into the prevalence of Mn in California’s private wells, and examining the shared characteristics of communities most likely to be exposed to unsafe levels of manganese in drinking water. By also performing a preliminary investigation of the relationship between Mn exposure and child cognitive health, our study will provide an initial assessment of the public health threat from Mn, highlight the most vulnerable communities, and inform regulatory agencies seeking to review drinking water standards for Mn.",Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater,10200044,R21ES030807,"['Absenteeism', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Bangladesh', 'Birth Weight', 'California', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disadvantaged', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Esthetics', 'Exposure to', 'Geological Survey', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impaired health', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Micronutrients', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Vital Statistics', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'base', 'contaminated water', 'demographics', 'drinking water', 'econometrics', 'elementary school', 'environmental health disparity', 'environmental justice', 'ethnic minority population', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'geochemistry', 'ground water', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'infant outcome', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'school district', 'socioeconomics', 'web site']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R21,2021,183893
"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,10186748,R01ES031259,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood specimen', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Neurotoxicity', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Consequentialism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expenditure', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vitamin B 12', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'dietary', 'early childhood', 'exposed human population', 'genome-wide', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'methylation biomarker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'routine screening', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,425421
"Impact of housing quality, race, and wildfire exposure on preterm birth in California Project Summary (Parent Grant)  Preterm birth is an important risk factor for perinatal mortality and adverse health consequences in childhood and adulthood. In the United States, approximately 10% of all live births were preterm (<37 weeks gestation) in 2012 and it continues to climb. Fresno County, in the San Joaquin Valley of California, is an area of known high air pollution burden and a high prevalence of preterm birth (12%).  Wildfires are a significant and increasing source of air pollution in California (CA) that threaten to reverse the progress made over the past decades in air pollution reduction and their effects on pregnant women are not well understood. Furthermore, recent fires are occurring at the wildfire urban interface leading to biomass and structure burning. With increased exposure to wildfire smoke comes increasing concern of health effects of these exposures to inform future regulation. Other biomass burning sources are agricultural waste burning, prescribed burns, and residential wood burning which all can increase air pollution exposure but in more controlled settings and are generally performed during seasons outside the growing fire season. They differ in scope, temperature and chemical composition and may have less severe health effects compared to wildfires.  We and other investigators have demonstrated preterm birth risk is sensitive to prenatal exposures to ambient air pollution, including criteria pollutants such as particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a product of incomplete combustion. Moreover, we have found stronger associations in neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic status. This double jeopardy of exposure to pollutants and poverty is hypothesized to contribute to disparities in preterm birth, but sufficient data are often lacking.  To address the contribution of wildfire and other biomass burning smoke exposures on preterm birth, and how these relationships may be modified by neighborhood deprivation, we propose to compile a unique group of datasets of fire occurrence, air quality monitoring and modelling, and birth record data for CA (2008-2016) to evaluate the effects of wildfires and intentional burning (agricultural waste, residential wood, and prescribed burns) exposure on preterm birth and to evaluate if the effects differ by the Index of Concentration at the Extreme, a measure of neighborhood deprivation that accounts for extremes based on race/ethnicity and income by census tract. We will compare different models of fire exposure assessment and examine critical periods of pregnancy with regard to preterm birth, while controlling for season.  This study will provide estimates of the impact of air pollution exposures from wildfires and other biomass burning on preterm birth. The findings have the potential to inform fire prevention and protection regulation for wildfires, agricultural waste burning, prescribed burns, and residential wood burning. Project Narrative (Parent Grant) We propose to study how mothers’ exposures to wildfire and intentional biomass burning during pregnancy may affect whether her baby is born prematurely. We will also evaluate the role of neighborhood deprivation and race/ethnicity may modify the relationship between fire exposures and preterm birth.","Impact of housing quality, race, and wildfire exposure on preterm birth in California",10399950,R01ES031261,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agriculture', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asians', 'Atlases', 'Biomass', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Birth Records', 'Burn injury', 'California', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fire - disasters', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Home', 'Household', 'Housing', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Investments', 'Live Birth', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Ozone', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Policies', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Price', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Seasons', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Taxes', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wildfire', 'Wood material', 'adverse birth outcomes', 'ambient air pollution', 'base', 'climate zone', 'critical period', 'deprivation', 'fine particles', 'fire prevention', 'indexing', 'low socioeconomic status', 'parent grant', 'pollutant', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prenatal exposure', 'racial and ethnic', 'random forest', 'residence', 'wasting']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,80227
"Applying and advancing modern approaches for studying the joint impacts of environmental chemicals on pregnancy outcomes Preterm birth is a significant public health challenge due to increasing rates over time, as well as serious consequences for infant mortality, childhood morbidity, and economic costs to society. Conditions that contribute to preterm birth remain unclear, though an influence by environmental chemical exposures is suspected but poorly understood. Establishing links with common environmental chemicals could have huge public health impact since many exposures could be modifiable through remediation, policies or other interventions. Low birth weight and fetal growth restriction also represent a great public health challenge, as they too have increased in recent decades and may be influenced by modifiable exposures to environmental chemicals. This project proposes to leverage the established Boston Lifecodes cohort study (N~4,000) of risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, with a focus on exposure to mixtures of commonly-encountered chemicals. We propose to select 1,000 singleton births from Lifecodes with detailed information and samples collected at multiple times during pregnancy. We will then utilize state-of-the-art methods to estimate biomarkers of exposure to chemical mixtures (per- and polyfluorinated substances [PFAS], phthalates and phthalate replacement chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH], and metals/metalloids), in addition to intermediate biomarkers of effect and repeated ultrasound measures of fetal growth, in order to provide much needed human data on environmental and other predictors of pregnancy outcomes and insights on the biological pathways involved. Results from our preliminary work show that oxidative stress may be an important link between exposure and outcome that needs to be explored in more depth using the proposed pathway-specific biomarkers. To accomplish our aims we will develop innovative statistical and machine learning approaches for analyzing mixtures and mediation with high-dimensional mediator sets, with the goal of improving our ability to discover and define these relationships. Finally, a study sub-aim is to identify conditions/activities contributing to high exposures that can inform exposure reduction strategies. The expected outcomes of this study are new and much needed information on the magnitude, sources, and impacts of exposure to commonly encountered chemicals, both individually and in combination, among pregnant women, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing health impacts from exposure to mixtures. Our findings will have a significant impact on public health given widespread exposure to the target chemicals, the growing need to identify environmental agents that adversely impact pregnancy, and the need to discover contributors to the high rates of preterm birth in the U.S. and beyond that could be prevented. Our study will also provide new information on the role of oxidative stress in adverse pregnancy outcomes which may inform future therapeutic or preventative interventions, and contribute new statistical and machine learning methods for investigating mixtures, mediation, and birth outcomes.

"Real-time AI-enhanced Low Dose Fluoroscopy Project Summary Motivation: Fluoroscopy is an indispensable tool for image-guided interventions in 50 million surgeries performed annually in the US. It leverages ionizing radiation from x-rays to provide surgeons with real-time, high-quality imaging feedback. Radiation exposure is harmful for both the patients and surgeons. Repetitive patient exposure has been shown to double the risk of breast cancer in women; meanwhile, surgeon exposure is also concerning. Orthopedic surgeons are 5x more likely to develop cancer in their lifetime; spine surgeons receive up to 12x more radiation exposure compared to other orthopedic surgeons. With minimally invasive surgery becoming widely adopted in recent years, the use of fluoroscopy has greatly increased. Surgeons rely on the navigation provided by fluoroscopy during these procedures, as they do not have direct visualization of the anatomy. Therefore, reducing the radiation exposure from fluoroscopy while maintaining high imaging quality is a high priority. In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promising advances to improve the quality of medical imaging. Subtle Medical Inc. has already received FDA clearance for its AI-based software products to reduce the dose for PET by four times and improve image quality for MRI. The motivation of this proposal is to translate our initial success to another imaging modality and achieve low dose fluoroscopy. Approach: This phase I SBIR project has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop AI software using recurrent deep learning architecture to achieve 6x dose reduction for fluoroscopy. Aim 2 is to design model pruning, kernel optimization, and high-performance inference frameworks to achieve real-time processing. Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate both qualitatively and quantitatively the developed software on phantoms and cadavers. Significance: This work will enable six times lower dose fluoroscopy. The completion of the project will have wide impact to greatly reduce radiation exposure in the operating room, hence reducing the risk of cancer development for both patients and clinicians. Project Narrative Fluoroscopy leverages ionizing radiation to provide surgeons with real-time, high-quality imaging feedback, indispensable for image-guided interventions in clinics. However, the radiation exposure introduces imaging risks, not only to the patients, but also to clinicians, who perform surgeries routinely. This project aims to develop and validate a fluoroscopy image enhancement software using artificial intelligence that can reduce the radiation dose by six folds.",Real-time AI-enhanced Low Dose Fluoroscopy,10385142,R43EB031655,"['Adopted', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Cadaver', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Device', 'Industrialization', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spine surgery', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vertebral column', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'experience', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'minimally invasive', 'model design', 'novel', 'operation', 'preservation', 'processing speed', 'real time model', 'software development', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,"SUBTLE MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2021,132173
"Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study Project Summary Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the primary cause of death and a major cause of years of life lost in the US and in the world. Cohort studies conducted in North America and Europe have provided crucial information in identifying exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as a cause of increased CVD risks. They have also pointed out important directions for future research, including the differential toxicity of PM2.5 chemical constituents to CVD incidence, the shape of concentration-response (C-R) functions, impact of exposure time windows and indoor air pollution exposure. The objectives of our study are to assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and incident CVD, and investigate the impact of exposure time window and indoor air pollution on these associations. Approach. We will conduct a retrospective multi-cohort study in China using personal health records from five national cohorts with adjudicated CVD endpoints maintained by the Fuwai Hospital. To provide individual-level exposure trajectories for ~120,000 cohort participants during their follow-up period, we will develop an ensemble machine learning model using ground air quality measurements, satellite data, and air quality model simulations to generate 1 km resolution national PM2.5 mass and major constituent (sulfates, nitrates, elemental carbon, organic carbon, lead, and nickel) exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 1). Using cohort data from 2007 to 2020 for our main analyses, we will use Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the associations of long-term exposures to PM2.5 constituents and adverse cardiovascular outcomes including total CVD, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke (Aim 2). Variations of this model will be used to investigate the shape of the C-R functions (linear vs. non-linear) as well as the impact of exposure errors using exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 2a). We will also examine windows of susceptibility for CVD endpoints using both time-variant and time- invariant exposure metrics (Aim 2b). Finally, we will evaluate the confounding effect of indoor air pollution on the C-R functions using a sub-cohort with estimated personal PM2.5 exposure estimates based on Fuwai Hospital's ongoing Multi-Region Panel Study (Aim 2c). Expected Results. Given the tremendous variability in PM2.5 constituent concentrations in China over time and space, our findings will contribute new PM2.5 constituent-specific C-R functions in CVD burden calculation in both the US and the world. Our study will also expand our knowledge on important factors affecting these associations such as exposure window and indoor air pollution. Narrative This study will assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in a retrospective multi-cohort study. Usinig five national cohorts and multi-city indoor air pollution measurements in China, we will investigate the shape of the CVD concentration-response functions and the impacts of indoor air pollution and exposure windows. The findings of this study will provide additional scientific support for designing effective policy and public health actions to lower the CVD burden in both the US and China.",Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study,10263210,R01ES032140,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Caliber', 'Carbon', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Concentration measurement', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Outcome', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meteorology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nickel', 'Nitrates', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Health Records', 'Policies', 'Pollution', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Sulfate', 'Supercomputing', 'Tennessee', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urbanization', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'ambient air pollution', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'fine particles', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'land use', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'particle', 'response', 'study population', 'years of life lost']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,547223
"Prenatal Environmental Mixtures, Cognitive Control and Reward Processes, And Risk for Psychiatric Problems in Adolescence. In utero exposure to environmental chemicals can disturb neurobehavioral development in both animals and in humans. The pathways linking in utero environmental exposures to neurobehavioral development likely involve exposure-induced changes in the function of neural circuits that support cognitive control and reward processes. We hypothesize that changes in the function of these circuits may act as a pathway between environmental exposure and a range of maladaptive behaviors that commonly emerge in late childhood and adolescence, a period that has been largely understudied with respect to the effects of prenatal exposures on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Such behavioral symptoms include attention problems, substance abuse, and psychotic experiences. This study will: 1) apply novel pattern recognition approaches to identify specific exposure profiles of complex high-dimensional mixtures of prenatal chemical and social exposures and examine how these profiles explain variation in risk for these behavioral symptoms in adolescence; 2) use task and resting state functional MRI (fMRI) to identify how distinct exposure profiles affect circuits that support cognitive control and reinforcement learning; and 3) explore if exposure-induced changes in brain activation and connectivity mediate associations between prenatal exposure profiles and behavioral symptoms in adolescence. Impact: This R01 will integrate advanced pattern recognition methods, a cognitive neuroscience approach and state-of-the-art fMRI techniques to explore brain pathways through which prenatal exposures alter behavior later in adolescence. We will explore circuit-based changes in brain function that may mediate associations between prenatal exposure profiles and symptoms of psychiatric disorders that typically emerge and co-occur in adolescence. By simultaneously studying mixtures of chemical and social stressors as well as profiles of co- occurring symptoms, we will greatly enhance our ability to comprehensively characterize the complex impacts of prenatal environmental exposures on behavioral symptoms in adolescence. Our findings will allow public health interventions to improve the quality of children's perinatal environment and the development of novel circuit-specific intervention tools. Pregnant women and their fetuses are exposed to multiple environmental insults during gestation, a very influential period for the fetal developing brain; prenatal exposures have been linked to increased cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problems including self-regulation, attention, conduct, and substance use problems, and psychotic experiences. Using a cognitive neuroscience approach, we seek to understand how in utero exposure to complex environmental mixtures alters the function of brain circuits that support cognitive control and reward processing, and gives rise to a range of behaviors that commonly emerge in late childhood and adolescence, a period that has been largely understudied with respect to the effects of prenatal exposures on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Our findings will allow public health interventions to improve the quality of children's perinatal environment and the development of novel circuit-specific intervention tools.","Prenatal Environmental Mixtures, Cognitive Control and Reward Processes, And Risk for Psychiatric Problems in Adolescence.",10303872,R01ES032296,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Influentials', 'Informal Social Control', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain pathway', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'early life stress', 'environmental chemical', 'environmental tobacco smoke', 'experience', 'fetal', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in utero', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health intervention', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'social', 'social stressor', 'statistical and machine learning', 'substance use', 'success', 'tool', 'trait']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,559563
"Causal machine learning methods for studying the effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer using natural experiments Project Summary: My goal is to build an independent research program in the development of causal inference methods for investigating environmental causes of childhood cancer. This K01 will enable me to conduct the focused, intensive research that will lay the groundwork for that program and to acquire the environmental, biological, and epidemiological training needed to maximize the rigor and impact of my work. Research: We propose to develop new causal machine learning (ML) methods that enable rigorous analysis of environmental natural experiments (NE) for estimation of the causal effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer. Classical approaches to studying relationships between environmental exposures and childhood cancer are plagued with challenges and are yielding inconsistent findings. We contend that the recent proliferation of local environmental regulatory programs has created ample relevant NEs, which provide a powerful alternative approach to study these relationships. However, existing methods for NE analysis are poorly-suited for environmental health contexts. In particular, existing methods fail in the presence of rare outcomes like childhood cancer (Aim 1), and they are not able to provide insight into the timing at which children are most susceptible to any adverse exposure effects (Aim 2). We propose causal ML methods that overcome these challenges and apply them to a NE to study the effects of traffic-related air toxics on childhood leukemia. We also provide open source software implementing these methods (Aim 3). Career Development and Training: Given my extensive prior training and experience in statistics and data science, the primary aim of the training funded by this award will be the acquisition of subject-matter proficiency, which will provide me with the insights needed to create more effective and impactful environmental health methods. Specifically, I will pursue knowledge in the biology and epidemiology of childhood cancer and in environmental health and exposure biology. The training will be achieved through a combination of (1) hands-on collaborative research as described above; (2) intensive cross-disciplinary mentorship, with mentors specializing in environmental health, pediatric oncology, cancer biology and epidemiology, and statistics; (3) carefully-selected coursework in the Departments of Epidemiology, Environmental Health, and Cell Biology at Harvard; and (4) relevant conferences, workshops, and seminars. I will place special emphasis on establishing a network of expert collaborators in all my areas of training. Environment: The Harvard Medical Campus is home to the top research teams worldwide in both childhood cancer and environmental health. Due to Harvard’s position at the forefront of scientific discovery in these fields, its unparalleled resources, its vibrant intellectual atmosphere, and its promotion of collaborative science that integrates knowledge across disciplines, it provides an ideal environment in which to train on these topics. Project Narrative: Decades of research on the relationship between environmental exposures and childhood cancer, relying on classic epidemiologic study designs, has produced a largely inconclusive body of literature, and has generated little robust, actionable evidence to protect children’s health. We propose an alternative methodological approach to this problem, which relies on environmental natural experiments to overcome many of the challenges presented by classic approaches. We develop causal machine learning methods tailored to this setting, which provide a promising new avenue for obtaining robust evidence about environmental causes of childhood cancer, and we apply the methods to study the effects of exposure to traffic-related air toxics on childhood leukemia.",Causal machine learning methods for studying the effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer using natural experiments,10104187,K01ES032458,"['1,3-Butadiene', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Benzene', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gasoline', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home', 'Incidence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Training', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Work', 'cancer epidemiology', 'career development', 'educational atmosphere', 'environmental agent', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'health application', 'health data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'open source', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2021,138538
"Data science tools to identify robust exposure-phenotype associations for precision medicine Project Summary/Abstract Phenotypic variability across demographically diverse populations are driven by environmental factors. The overall goal of this proposal is to deploy data science approaches to drive discovery of associations between exposures (E) and phenotypes (P) in demographically diverse populations. We lack data science methods to associate, replicate, and prioritize exposure variables of the exposome (E) in phenotypes (P) and disease incidence (D), required for the delivery of precision medicine. Observational studies are fraught with 4 unsolved data science challenges. First, E-based studies are: (1) limited to associating a few hypothesized exposure- phenotype pairs (E-P) at a time, leading to a fragmented literature of environmental associations. Machine learning (ML) approaches for feature selection and prediction hold promise, however, (2) most extant E-based cohorts contain missing data, challenging the use of ML to detect complex E-P associations, Third, (3) biases, such as confounding and study design influence associations and hinder translation. Fourth, (4) there are few well-powered data resources that systematically document longitudinal E-P and E-D associations across massive precision medicine. It is a challenge to systematically associate a number of exposures in multiple phenotypes and replicate these associations across cohorts. (Aim 1). The “vibration of effects”, or the degree to which associations change as a function of study design (e.g., analytic method, sample size) and model choice is a hidden bias in observational studies (Aim 2). Third, an outstanding question is the degree to which environmental differences lead to health disparities. To address these challenges and gaps, we propose to Aim 1: develop and test machine learning methods to associate multiple environmental exposure indicators with multiple phenotypes: EP-WAS. We hypothesize that exposures will explain a significant amount of variation in phenotype in populations and will deposit all data and models in a novel EP-WAS Catalog. Aim 2: Quantitate how study design influences associations between exposure biomarkers and phenotype. We will scale up, extend, and test a method called “vibration of effects” (VoE) to measure how study criteria influences the stability of associations (how reproducible associations are as a function of analytic choice). Aim 3. Leverage EP-WAS and VoE to disentangle biological, demographic, and environmental influences of phenotypic disparities in hypercholesterolemia. We will deploy EP-WAS and VoE packaged libraries in the largest cohort study to partition phenotypic variation across demographic groups in factors for hypercholesterolemia. We will equip the biomedical community with data science approaches for robust data-driven discovery and interpretation of exposure-phenotype factors in observational datasets, required for the identification of environmental health disparities. For the first time, investigators will ascertain the collective role of the environment in heart disease at scale just in time for the All of Us program. Project Narrative Massive observational cohorts with the exposome (ie, multiple environmental factors) and phenome (disease risk factors) are being assembled by countries worldwide. We will equip the biomedical community with data science and machine learning tools for robust data-driven imputation, discovery, interpretation, and re-use of complex exposure-phenotype associations that emerge from big data. Applications of our methods will address several high-priority goals for the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) including identification of environmental health disparities in heart disease that are critical for precision medicine implementation.",Data science tools to identify robust exposure-phenotype associations for precision medicine,10095924,R01ES032470,"['Address', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiology', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Deposition', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet and Nutrition', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Observational Study', 'Phenotype', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'disease disparity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'environmental health disparity', 'feature selection', 'genetic risk factor', 'health difference', 'health disparity', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'phenome', 'precision medicine', 'scale up', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,697752
"The Impact of Drought on Arsenic Exposure and Cardiometabolic Outcomes in a Rural Aging Population Project Summary / Abstract Droughts are an important natural disaster but the health implications for elderly populations in the United States have not been extensively studied. This study seeks to provide evidence on the cardiometabolic health risks posed by drought. Droughts can contribute to groundwater over-pumping, and this may in turn lead to arsenic release from aquifer clays into drinking water sources. The impacts of drought on arsenic exposure and resultant health outcomes in human populations are potentially important and this study seeks to address that knowledge gap. We propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study using data from the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study, as well as hydrogeological measurements of water and environmental conditions in the San Luis Valley, to clarify relationships between drought, arsenic in water, arsenic exposure (as measured by urine biomarker), and cardiometabolic health outcomes including incident diabetes (DM), incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all-cause mortality. This work is community-engaged and includes a K12 outreach component. Aim 1 quantifies the relationship of drought to individual arsenic exposures and thence to incident CVD, incident DM, and mortality. Aim 2 generates a model for groundwater arsenic as a function of hydrological predictors using machine learning approaches, and uses this to explore relationships between drought, modeled water arsenic and the outcomes of Aim 1. Aim 3 estimates the association between cumulative arsenic exposure and incident CVD, incident DM, and mortality, using a nested case-control design and predictions over time of arsenic exposure from the Aim 2 model. Aim 4 is a simulation study projecting future CVD and DM outcomes under different scenarios of drought conditions, with and without counterfactual interventions to reduce drinking water arsenic. Project Narrative This community-engaged project in San Luis Valley, Colorado seeks to identify cardiometabolic disease risks posed by drought through arsenic for elderly Hispanic and non-Hispanic white adult men and women, through interdisciplinary team science bringing together hydrogeological and epidemiological modeling.",The Impact of Drought on Arsenic Exposure and Cardiometabolic Outcomes in a Rural Aging Population,10299821,R01ES032612,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aging', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Cardiometabolic Disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Climate', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease Outcome', 'Droughts', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Geology', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning Module', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'SECTM1 gene', 'STEM career', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Visit', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging population', 'biological sex', 'cardiometabolism', 'case control', 'clay', 'climate change', 'cohort', 'community engaged research', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'drinking water', 'empowered', 'epidemiological model', 'exposure pathway', 'extreme weather', 'geochemistry', 'ground water', 'hydrology', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'population based', 'preventive intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'remote sensing', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'water conservation', 'water quality', 'weather-related disaster']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,671536
"The External Exposome and COVID-19 Severity among Individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias PROJECT SUMMARY The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic with severe consequences. Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are at a higher risk of contracting COVID- 19 and experiencing severe COVID-19. However, risk factors for COVID-19 severity among individuals with ADRD beyond older age and comorbidities remain largely undefined, and the ability to predict COVID-19 severity among ADRD patients is limited. There are large overlaps between the currently known risk factors of severe COVID-19 and the health conditions that are affected by environmental exposures, and emerging evidence suggested that long-term environmental exposures may be important determinants of COVID-19 severity. Our current R21 (1R21ES032762) was set to identify novel environmental exposures associated with COVID-19 severity considering the totality of the external environment (or the external exposome). Compared with the general population, individuals with ADRD are substantially different in their individual characteristics and environmental exposure profiles. Therefore, a more focused study on the relationships between environmental exposures and COVID-19 severity among ADRD individuals is needed. The rise of real-world data (RWD) creates the perfect opportunity to create a synthetic COVID-19 cohort of individuals with ADRD at the scale needed to understand the full-spectrum of COVID-19 outcomes among individuals with ADRD. Nevertheless, there are two key barriers: (1) the lack of a consensus on methods for examining the external exposome-health associations, and (2) the lack of a pipeline to accurately identify ADRD patients from RWD and extract important risk factors that are only available in unstructured clinical notes. Expanding our parent award on the external exposome and COVID-19 severity to focus on individuals with ADRD, we aim to fill these important gaps to: (1) create a synthetic longitudinal COVID-19 cohort of individuals with ADRD, (2) systematically evaluate statistical methods for external exposome-wide association study (ExWAS), specifically for COVID-19 outcomes among ADRD patients, and (3) through an external ExWAS, identify external exposome factors associated with COVID-19 severity and then develop predictive models of COVID-19 severity among individuals with ADRD. This study builds upon our continuous work on the external exposome and OneFlorida – a repository of RWD with linked electronic health records, claims, and vital statistics data that covers > 60% of Floridians. This study will generate: (1) a large longitudinal COVID-19 cohort of individuals with ADRD, (2) standardized state-of-the-art statistical methods to conduct external ExWAS, and (3) novel external exposome factors associated with COVID-19 severity and predictive models of ADRD patients at high- risk of severe COVID-19. Our approach can be scaled up through PCORnet to create a national cohort and expanded to examine COVID-19’s long-term effects among individuals with ADRD in future studies.

"Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) ABSTRACT Most human diseases involve interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Although the environment is implicated in most chronic diseases, the etiology and mechanisms of action underlying these diseases remain unclear. It is estimated that more than 80,000 chemicals are currently used in commerce, challenging elucidation about chemical mechanisms-of-action and prioritization of environmental health research. Integration of diverse data is required to understand environment- disease associations, mechanisms of chemical action, toxicity prediction and development of effective therapeutic interventions. In 2004, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctdbase.org) was launched publicly to address an unmet need for a public data resource dedicated exclusively to advancing understanding about environment-disease connections. Today, through diversified funding approaches and in response to the evolving needs of the environmental health research community, CTD provides a combination of richly annotated data describing chemical- gene-phenotype-disease networks, exposure information, and novel analysis tools that enable user- driven discoveries about environmental influences on human health. Currently, CTD provides >2.5 million manually curated relationships for 16,400 chemicals, 51,300 genes/proteins, 5,500 phenotypes, and 7,200 diseases, contextualized with over 870 anatomical terms from approximately 600 species. CTD curated data has been integrated into >145 other biomedical resources further extending the reach of its impact. CTD has become a valued resource on which the environmental health research community relies. We are requesting funding to: 1) continue advancing understanding about the complex connections between environmental exposures and human health through ongoing manual curation of chemicals, genes, phenotypes, diseases and exposure data from the scientific literature; evaluation and integration of select external data sets; and baseline technical support; 2) enhance curation efficiency through further development of our text-mining and online curation tools; and 3) selectively restructure existing code, software, and database design (refactoring) to improve the structure and performance of CTD. This proposed project will protect and extend NIH investments in CTD and ensure the ongoing provision of this key resource for the environmental health research community. NARRATIVE Despite the thousands of chemicals used in commerce, our understanding of their effects on human health is not well understood. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a unique, publicly available resource that provides information about human exposures and how these exposures influence our genes, our biology, and ultimately our health. This project will build on our established infrastructure to expand the data content and analysis capacity of CTD to provide new insights into the complex relationship between our environment and human diseases.",Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD),10269582,U24ES033155,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Chemical Actions', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Commerce', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Productivity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Software Design', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Widespread Disease', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'comparative', 'data complexity', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'database design', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'exposed human population', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'preservation', 'research and development', 'response', 'text searching', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool', 'web-based tool']",NIEHS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,U24,2021,1048836
"Evaluating the effect of water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes Project Summary/Abstract The objective of this K99/R00 proposal is to estimate the effect of community water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes in California and identify whether there are subpopulations who are especially vulnerable to fluoride exposure during pregnancy. Fluoride has been added to water supplies to promote dental health in the United States since 1945, but the impacts on pregnancy outcomes have never been assessed. It is possible that maternal and in-utero fetal exposure to fluoride increases risk of preterm birth and small-for- gestational age. A small number of studies in other countries suggest there is an increased risk of adverse birth outcomes associated with drinking water with naturally high levels of fluoride, and evidence suggests fluoride consumption can affect thyroid function and cardiovascular systems, both of which play important roles in regulating and maintaining a healthy pregnancy. Since 1995, California has required water systems with at least 10,000 service connections to fluoridate their water, but systems were only required to implement a fluoridation program once the funds were allocated. Therefore, there is a substantial amount of variability in which water systems have added fluoride over the last 25 years, and when they did so. We will leverage this variation in water fluoridation practices in California to (1) identify the effects of changes in water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes during 2006-2017 and (2) evaluate whether there are heterogeneous exposure effects by maternal/fetal characteristics and environmental co-exposures. Furthermore, we will use the ECHO.CA.IL pregnancy cohort, which is composed of pregnant women and their children in San Francisco and Illinois, to (3a) assess whether maternal urinary fluoride during the second trimester is associated with reduced gestational age or lower birthweight-for-gestational-age-z-scores at birth and (3b) evaluate whether there are heterogeneous effects of exposure by maternal/fetal characteristics and environmental co-exposures. The research plan is bolstered by an exceptional mentorship team and training plan at the University of San Francisco, California. The proposed project builds on the applicant’s background in perinatal epidemiology and provides training in new statistical methods to identify heterogeneous exposure effects and education in the biological processes of gestation and parturition, exposure assessment of environmental chemicals, and translating scientific findings to policymakers. The combined research and training plans will enable the candidate to transition into an independent researcher of policy-relevant social and environmental factors that shape perinatal health. This research aligns with NIEHS’s strategic goals to evaluate health effects of the exposome, identify individual susceptibilities to environmental hazards, utilize data science techniques, and generate evidence that can be utilized by policymakers to improve population health. Project Narrative Community water fluoridation may affect perinatal health outcomes, but this has never been evaluated in the United States. It is critical to understand how this widespread practice affects the health of mothers and infants, and whether subgroups of the population are uniquely vulnerable. This project will provide critical information to assist public health officials in making informed decisions about the ongoing practice of adding fluoride to water supplies in the United States.",Evaluating the effect of water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes,10284698,K99ES033274,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Arsenic', 'Award', 'Biological Process', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Birth Weight', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Communities', 'Community of Practice', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Education', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endocrine system', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetus', 'Fluorides', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hormones', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Maternal Health', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal Epidemiology', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Small for Gestational Age Infant', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Thyroid Function Tests', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'Water fluoridation', 'Whole Blood', 'Woman', 'Women Status', 'adverse birth outcomes', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'drinking water', 'environmental chemical', 'fetal', 'health disparity', 'health of the mother', 'healthy pregnancy', 'improved', 'in utero', 'lead exposure', 'low socioeconomic status', 'male', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'perinatal health', 'population health', 'prenatal exposure', 'pressure', 'programs', 'sex', 'social', 'social factors', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'urinary']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2021,99568
"The role of the social environment in the association between air pollution and cardiovascular disease Abstract Contextual level factors like neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES) and racial residential segregation (RRS) are potential confounders that may bias air pollution epidemiology studies. Few studies have systematically examined the magnitude of confounding by these important contextual factors. To our knowledge no studies have included RRS as a confounder in air pollution-cardiovascular disease (CVD) studies. We propose to conduct a systematic assessment of the confounding and synergist roles of SES (both at the neighborhood and individual levels) and RRS in a unique and robust data source made-up of eight well- characterized chronic disease cohort studies. Extensive covariate data, consistent and lengthy follow-up of participants, high quality air pollution exposures and standardized collection of CVD outcomes makes this an ideal data source within which to conduct this important work. An existing project is underway to harmonize data across these cohorts. Our aims are to: 1) assess the association between different indicators of SES and RRS and long-term ambient air pollution exposures cross-sectionally and over time, by developing state-of-the- art measures of SES and RRS 2) conduct quantitative bias analysis to evaluate the magnitude of confounding by SES and RRS in the association between long-term air pollution and CVD mortality and events and 3) examine the joint effects of long-term air pollution and SES and RRS on cardiovascular events and mortality. We will create a time-varying NSES index from principal components analysis for the time period 1990 - 2015 and measures of evenness (dissimilarity index) and isolation (isolation index) to evaluate RRS. We will use spatial regression approaches for aim 1, probabilistic quantitative bias analysis for aim 2 and survival analysis for aim 3. The public health impact of this proposal is three-fold. First, evaluating the magnitude of confounding by SES in air pollution epidemiology studies will strengthen the evidence used for national air pollution standards. Second, exploration of RRS could establish a new contextual confounder for air pollution epidemiology. And third, developing a rigorous and strongly theoretically grounded framework for assessing multiple spatially varying factors will help us better understand longstanding environmental health disparities and may help design future interventions and policy. Project Narrative Contextual level factors like neighborhood socioeconomic status and racial residential segregation are potential confounders that may bias air pollution epidemiology studies. In a unique and robust data source made-up of eight well-characterized cardiovascular disease cohort studies, we propose to conduct a systematic assessment of confounding by neighborhood and individual level socioeconomic status and racial residential segregation in studies of air pollution and cardiovascular disease.

"Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status Abstract Exposures to extreme events are increasingly common in many parts of the globe as a function of changes in weather patterns combined with rising sea levels, but there is a paucity of data to support scientific research on the implications of such exposures for population health and well-being over the long-term. STAR, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, is a unique exception. We have interviewed respondents from 10 months before the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami for 10 years. This project will follow up the same respondents 15 years after the tsunami. The pre-tsunami baseline is a population-representative survey of 27,000 individuals who were living along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. The tsunami constitutes a large-scale, unanticipated natural disaster in an area that was not thought to be prone to tsunamis. Moreover, its impacts were spatially idiosyncratic across the study area. Whether a particular community was inundated by the waves depended on a combination of the wave direction, seabed and shoreline topography. Of 368 baseline communities, about a fifth were devastated, a third were somewhat damaged and the rest were not directly affected. These features of the natural experiment provide the basis for identifying causal impacts of this major natural disaster which killed 170,000 people in the study area. The baseline and six post-tsunami waves collected during the prior phase of this project provide detailed information about exposure to and experience of the disaster and the evolution of health and wellbeing, broadly defined, for baseline respondents who survived the tsunami plus new household members. In each follow-up, we have interviewed 95% of all baseline survivors. In this continuation we will re-interview all baseline survivors and their household members fifteen years after the tsunami. We will place these data in the public domain, adding to prior waves of STAR already in the public domain to create an unparalleled data resource for the scientific community. Focusing on those who were exposed to the tsunami as children (age <12y and in utero at the time), we will investigate the impacts of tsunami exposure on the evolution of health, education and cognitive performance, linking outcomes to changes in material and psycho-social resources at the family level as well as community level resources. The latter will be measured combining administrative data and information extracted from satellite imagery using machine learning. Longer-term impacts, fifteen years after the tsunami, will exploit innovative human capital measures including biomarkers, executive function and emotional reactivity. Loss of one or both parents is among the most extreme exposures.

"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,10162467,R01AG064589,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Calendar', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research Design', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'To specify', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'base', 'cardiovascular effects', 'cerebrovascular', 'cohort', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'design', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'population health', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'time use', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'trend analysis', 'venous thromboembolism']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,561787
"The Study of the Environment and Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias (SEAD) PROJECT SUMMARY The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a major public health and clinical challenge in the United States. Identification of ADRD causes to inform prevention and policy is the most efficient way to address these challenges. Most research to date has focused on identifying genetic causes of ADRD, however, recent population-scale studies have shown that environmental exposures, such as lead and cadmium, also contribute to ADRD risk and etiology. Initial findings on environmental factors linked to ADRD risk is promising, but human evidence is limited. A wide range of environmental exposures (exposome) have never been evaluated systematically in relation to incident ADRD. While there is a growing demand to predict future risk for ADRS more precisely, the role of exposomic data in improving ADRD risk prediction has never been evaluated. To address these gaps, we propose a prospective cohort study by capitalizing on existing large-scale, United States nationally representative, multi-ethnic population-based data. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, from 1998-2010, n>15,000) has a variety of environmental chemical exposure measurements, behavioral risk factors, and clinical phenotypes, and when linked to Medicare data, provides up to 25 years of incident ADRD. We aim to (1) conduct a biologic hypothesis-based approach to test the associations of chronic exposure to lead and cadmium with incident ADRD; (2) conduct a data-driven environment-wide association study to systematically evaluate a wide-range of environmental toxicants with incident ADRD; and (3) develop and validate an exposome-based risk prediction model for ADRD using machine learning methods. The proposed study will advance scientific understanding on how modifiable and currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants can lead to the development of ADRD. This study assesses the exposome to improve prediction of future disease risk and define vulnerable populations more precisely. This research will highlight individual-level and population-level interventions (i.e. precision health) to effectively prevent or reduce the risk of ADRD in the US population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health and precision health because comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of modifiable environmental exposures, including the currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants lead and cadmium, will advance scientific understanding on the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and inform individual-level and population-level interventions to effectively prevent or reduce the burden of ADRD. The proposed study is directly responsive to the 2018 National Institute on Aging AD Research Summit recommendations related to Understanding the Impact of the Environment to Advance Disease Prevention and Enabling Precision Medicine Research for AD/ADRD, and to the research goal of NOT-AG-18-053, Enabling precision medicine for AD/ADRD through deep molecular phenotyping.",The Study of the Environment and Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias (SEAD),10120924,R01AG070897,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cadmium', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotoxins', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'abeta deposition', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'bone', 'chronic Pb exposure', 'clinical phenotype', 'dementia risk', 'demographics', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'effective intervention', 'environmental chemical', 'environmental chemical exposure', 'follow-up', 'human population study', 'improved', 'lead exposure', 'machine learning method', 'modifiable risk', 'molecular phenotype', 'multi-ethnic', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'symposium', 'tau expression', 'toxicant']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,692598
"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes.

"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data. In so doing, we will identify molecular disease signatures, including environmental toxins, metabolism-related chemicals and gut bacteria, unique to PSC patients.",Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome,10246292,RC2DK118619,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bile duct carcinoma', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'High Performance Computing', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Institution', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Disease', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Network-based', 'Norway', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Universities', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical database', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'gut bacteria', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'methylomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'pollutant', 'primary outcome', 'primary sclerosing cholangitis', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'toxin metabolism', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational study']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,RC2,2021,1505125
"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,10132972,R01AI135115,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladeshi', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholera', 'Cholera Vaccine', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Haiti', 'Haitian', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sanitation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serology', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standardization', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Vibrio cholerae O1', 'Vibrio cholerae infection', 'Water', 'age related', 'base', 'cohort', 'diarrheal disease', 'disorder risk', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'lateral flow assay', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'serosurveillance', 'serosurvey', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,663407
"Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence Project Summary Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhalation of spores from the soil-dwelling fungi Coccidioides immitis or C. posadasii, and can lead to chronic lung infection, meningitis, or death. Southwestern states are currently experiencing among the highest incidence rates of coccidioidomycosis ever recorded. The disease has levied a substantial human and economic burden throughout the southwest, totaling an estimated $2.2 billion in charges in California alone for coccidioidomycosis-associated hospitalizations from 2000-2011. Critical gaps in understanding have hindered the public health response, including how dust, pathogen, and individual risk factors interact to determine disease incidence, as well as how environmental factors influence the distribution of the pathogen and dust. To address these gaps, this project investigates the impacts of dust exposure, environmental variability, and sociodemographic change on Coccidioides spp. proliferation, dispersion, and coccidioidomycosis infection rates in California. The research focuses on three main aims: 1) investigate the influence of climate variation and dust exposure on the spatiotemporal distribution of cocci incidence using >65,000 geolocated surveillance records from 2000 to 2018 and a case-crossover design; 2) identify environmental sources of C. immitis at high spatial and temporal resolution in disturbed and undisturbed soil, and determine how wind, rainfall, soil disturbance and other factors influence spore dispersion through longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil; and 3) predict changes in pathogen density over space and time and estimate the exposure-response relationship between pathogen density and risk of infection using a case-crossover approach with prospective surveillance for incident cases. In pursuit of these aims, the research will combine georeferenced coccidioidomycosis case data across California since 2000 at an unprecedented spatial resolution with fine-scale dust concentration estimates and environmental data from a combination of remote sensing, modeling and ground monitors. We will use novel field and laboratory methods to conduct longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil, determining how microenvironmental conditions and cyclical patterns of rainfall and drought determine pathogen source dynamics, and identifying conditions that support pathogen dispersion through the air. Through these activities, we will identify the specific dust conditions that pose the greatest risk for infection, estimate pathogen exposure and the dose- response relationship, and evaluate heterogeneity in this relationship across risk groups and regions. The results will elucidate drivers of the current epidemic, enhance understanding of the distribution and dispersion of Coccidioides spp. in the environment, and identify high risk regions and subpopulations. The knowledge gained will support decision-makers in targeting, designing and implementing protective measures for vulnerable populations. Project Narrative This project addresses gaps in our understanding of the kinds of dust exposures, and the environmental and social conditions, that increase the incidence of coccidioidomycosis in the southwest. The findings will have wide-ranging benefits for public health, including a better understanding of how people are exposed to the pathogen, the identification of areas and people that are at the highest risk, and predictions of future coccidioidomycosis that can be used to prevent infection in vulnerable groups.",Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence,10065493,R01AI148336,"['Address', 'Air', 'Area', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Climatology', 'Coccidioides', 'Coccidioides immitis', 'Coccidioides posadasii', 'Coccidioidomycosis', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Droughts', 'Dust', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Environmental Wind', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Influenza', 'Inhalation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung infections', 'Measures', 'Meningitis', 'Meteorology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Rain', 'Records', 'Reproduction spores', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Conditions', 'Soil', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'burden of illness', 'density', 'design', 'environmental intervention', 'experience', 'fungus', 'high risk', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'remote sensing', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'temporal measurement', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,838232
"Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health PROJECT SUMMARY Over 80% of the US population resides in urban areas, and the built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may drive cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain, and by influencing exposures to environmental factors, such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Evidence for the built environment and CVD has been dominated by cross-sectional studies with nonspecific exposure assessment. Developing precise, time-varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to establish causal relationships between the built environment and CVD, which are crucial to informing policy-relevant, actionable interventions. It is now possible to estimate such exposure metrics at scale in prospective cohort studies using deep learning computer vision methods, a class of machine learning algorithms that can accurately process images, combined with time-varying nationwide street-level imagery, high resolution satellite data, and novel mobile health technologies. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing built environment exposure measures from deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data in participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (N=500), and to geocoded residential addresses from nationwide Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts (N=288,000). We will create built environment exposure measures by leveraging deep learning algorithms applied to nationwide Google Street View imagery (2007-2020) and high-resolution Landsat satellite data (1986-2020) to create fine-scale, time-varying built environment metrics of the natural environment (e.g., trees), physical environment (e.g., sidewalks), perceptions (e.g., safety), and urban form (e.g., compact high-rise). We will use a mix of innovative analytical approaches to determine the effect of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence across different time horizons. First, we will append these metrics to time-activity patterns of participants who have collected minute-level data on GPS and physical activity from smartphones and consumer wearable devices to quantify how minute-level exposure to the built environment is related to CVD health behaviors. Next, we will apply novel built environment metrics to residential address histories of participants to estimate how self-reported CVD health behaviors change after their residential built environment changes. Last, we will examine the association between long-term cumulative residential exposure to the built environment and CVD incidence over 34 years of follow-up. Our work will enable us to measure built environment exposure from unprecedented perspectives in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential causal relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, and to better specify pathways to CVD incidence. Ultimately, our work will yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health. PROJECT NARRATIVE The built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain and by shaping exposures to environmental hazards (e.g., air pollution, extreme temperatures, noise); however, developing accurate, time- varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to build causal relationships between the built environment and CVD and to inform policy-relevant, actionable interventions. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing longitudinal built environment exposure measures from street-view and satellite imagery using deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data from a) 500 participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (NHS3) and b) over 34 years of geocoded residential addresses from three large nationwide cohorts of over 288,000 US adult women and men from the Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts. Our work will enable us to measure time-varying exposure to the built environment with unprecedented precision in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, to better specify pathways to CVD incidence, and ultimately, to yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health.",Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health,10192819,R01HL150119,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Global Positioning System', 'Green space', 'Health Professional', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Noise', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physical environment', 'Planet Earth', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'built environment', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'experience', 'extreme temperature', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'insight', 'land use', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'novel', 'petabyte', 'spatiotemporal', 'urban area', 'urban planning', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2021,785476
"Modifiable Risk Factors for the Emergence of Resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa Project Summary Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CR-P. aeruginosa) contributes to significant mortality in hospitalized patients. Only four β-lactam agents with activity against CR-P. aeruginosa are available in the US, of which ceftolozane-tazobactam (C-T) is the most frequently used to treat CR-P. aeruginosa. Pre-clinical investigations indicate C-T had activity against >90% of P. aeruginosa isolates; after clinical use, reports of P. aeruginosa that initially tested susceptible to C-T but became resistant during therapy emerged. Our preliminary data indicate that amongst 28 consecutive patients infected with CR-P. aeruginosa with isolates initially susceptible to C-T, 50% of patients had subsequent P. aeruginosa isolates with > 4-fold increase in C-T minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) up to 30 days after C-T exposure. We identified genetic markers contributing to resistance through whole genome sequencing (WGS) – notably mutations in the ampC-ampR region and in PBP3. Alarmingly, 86% of P. aeruginosa isolates initially susceptible to another novel antibiotic, ceftazidime-avibactam (C-A), exhibited resistance to C-A after C-T exposure - in the absence of C-A exposure. This is concerning as the emergence of resistance to one novel agent could eliminate the few remaining treatment options. We explored modifiable risk factors that could reduce the frequency of C-T resistance and found that 30% of patients who received C-T over 1 hour had subsequent C-T resistant isolates, whereas no patients who received the drug over 3 hours developed resistant isolates. We would like to repeat this exploratory work and include experimental validation studies in a cohort of 260 patients across seven hospitals who have paired P. aeruginosa clinical isolates stored at -80°C and were prescribed C-T. In Aim 1, WGS will identify the genetic loci associated with C-T resistance comparing paired CR-P. aeruginosa isolates from the same patient before and up to 30 days after C-T exposure. Validation will occur through cloning and site-directed mutagenesis work. Broth microdilution will determine susceptibility testing results for the three other β-lactams with activity against CR-P. aeruginosa to quantify the emergence of cross-resistance. In Aim 2, we will capitalize on diverse C-T administration strategies at participating sites and develop a machine learning derived decision tree to inform clinicians how to prescribe C-T most effectively to reduce the likelihood of acquired resistance. The following are some risk factors that will be investigated for potential inclusion: (1) infusion of C-T over 3 hours, (2) high-dose C-T, (3) combination antibiotic therapy, (4) dialysis dependency, (5) source of infection and source control, (6) number of days of C-T exposure. This work will (1) inform future drug development by identifying areas of the bacterial chromosome highly prone to resistance and in need of additional reinforcement and (2) identify modifiable risk factors that can be used by clinicians to enable novel antibiotics to remain effective treatment options for extended periods of time. Project Narrative Only four β-lactam antibiotics with activity against carbapenem-resistant-P. aeruginosa are available in the United States, of which ceftolozane-tazobactam (C-T) is the most frequently prescribed. Our preliminary data indicate that high-level resistance of CR-P. aeruginosa to C-T can occur shortly after clinical exposure to this agent. Using a cohort of 260 patients contributing paired CR-P. aeruginosa isolates before and after C-T exposure, we propose to: (1) identify and experimentally validate genetic markers leading to C-T resistance; (2) determine the frequency with which C-T resistance leads to cross-resistance to the three other β-lactam agents with activity against C-T; and (3) develop a machine-learning derived decision tree to inform clinicians of modifiable risk factors that could slow the emergence of resistance to C-T.",Modifiable Risk Factors for the Emergence of Resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa,10301838,R21AI153580,"['Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacterial Chromosomes', 'Binding Sites', 'Case Series', 'Case Study', 'Ceftazidime', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Combined Antibiotics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Drug resistance', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Imipenem', 'Infection', 'Infusion procedures', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Monobactams', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Point Mutation', 'Predisposition', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regrets', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Source', 'Tazobactam', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'carbapenem resistance', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'combat', 'design', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic locus', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'pre-clinical', 'respiratory', 'urinary', 'validation studies', 'whole genome']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,275758
"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Early Risk of Maternal CVD: Influence of the External Exposome PROJECT SUMMARY Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are the most common pregnancy complication and are associated with an increased long-term risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) which is also the leading cause of death for women in the US. Emerging evidence suggests that environmental exposure during pregnancy may play an important role in the development of HDP. However, several limitations exist, including 1) the ignorance of residential mobility during pregnancy in exposure assessments, 2) the lack of studies considering different subtype, onset, and severity of HDP, and 3) the lack of considerations of the totality of environment (i.e. the exposome). While HDP have been linked to long-term CVD risk after pregnancy, limited data are available on early maternal CVD risk (within the first five years after delivery) complicated by HDP. More importantly, no study has focused on the impact of environmental exposures during and after pregnancy on maternal CVD risk after pregnancy. In addition, risk assessment models of HDP predominantly rely on biomarkers that are not ubiquitously tested among all pregnant women, and no predictive model has been developed to identify women at higher CVD risk after pregnancy. This study builds on our prior work in the external exposome and leverages our access to the unique statewide linked electronic health records-birth records data from the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium to address multiple challenges in the field by: 1) determining the association between pregnancy external exposome and risk of HDP, considering the subtype, onset, and severity of HDP and accounting for pregnancy residential mobility in exposure measurements; 2) assessing early risk of maternal CVD after pregnancy associated with HDP and the external exposome, and 3) developing predictive models of HDP and early risk of maternal CVD after pregnancy. This research project will be embedded in a comprehensive training program consisting of coursework, guided experiential and clinical learning, seminars, and mentorship by an established team of experts. The training program is designed to further my strengths and to develop new research skills while contributing to our scientific understanding of environmental impacts on cardiovascular health among pregnant and postpartum women. The training proposal details a five-year plan of formal and informal instruction in cardiovascular health, omics and exposome research, biomedical informatics and data science, and professional skills. My short-term career goals include completing coursework in all training areas, disseminating study findings through publications and presentations, engaging in career development activities, and applying for independent R01 funding in the third year of the award. My long-term career goal is to become an independent, collaborative, and productive epidemiologist and health data scientist leading research programs in cardiovascular health, with a focus on its intersection with perinatal and environmental epidemiology using big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a major cause of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, and emerging evidence suggests that environmental exposure during pregnancy may play an important role in the development of HDP and subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) after pregnancy. However, multiple challenges and knowledge gaps exist in previous studies such as the lack of studies considering different subtype, onset, and severity of HDP, the lack of considerations of the totality of environment (i.e. the exposome), and limited understandings on how environmental exposures during pregnancy may impact subsequent maternal CVD risk after delivery. Leveraging the unique statewide linked electronic health records-birth records data from OneFlorida, this study builds on our prior work in the external exposome, aiming to examine the associations between the external exposome and risk of HDP and early risk of maternal CVD after pregnancy as well as to develop predictive models of HDP and maternal CVD after pregnancy to guide precision preventions.",Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Early Risk of Maternal CVD: Influence of the External Exposome,10214088,K01HL153797,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Records', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Eclampsia', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'High Risk Woman', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Perinatal Epidemiology', 'Play', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residential Mobility', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Vital Statistics', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'career', 'career development', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital repositories', 'experience', 'fetal', 'health data', 'hypertensive factor', 'individualized prevention', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'informal learning', 'insight', 'maternal morbidity', 'maternal risk', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'programs', 'science teacher', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,167207
"Impact of early-life perturbations on pediatric microbiome maturation ABSTRACT During the first 3 years of life (YOL) the infant gut microbiome (GM) rapidly diversifies both in structure and function, concomitant with dietary and environmental transitions. Critically, the GM response to specific external stimuli is patient-specific, complicating individualized risk predictions. Healthy GM maturation includes accruing multiple strains of the same species, which frequently differ in key functions. These functional differences, ac- centuated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and de novo mutations, could resolve conflicting associations of the same species with both health and disease. The rationale behind our proposal is that strain- and species- level variation in bacterial functions drives heterogenous GM responses to early-life (EL) dietary and antibiotic perturbations, which explains, in part, individualized developmental trajectories. This proposal pursues two highly complementary Aims: 1) Define strain-resolved functional maturation of the pediatric gut microbiome and 2) Investigate the acute effects of EL antibiotic (ELA) perturbation on strain dynamics, HGT, and micro- biome maturation in preterm neonates and microbiota-humanized mice. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that EL environmental exposures shape genomic diversification of gut species, causing lasting changes in GM com- munity structure and microbial functions. We will leverage our unique set of 2,436 stools collected over the first 9 YOL from infants variably exposed to dietary and environmental stimuli. By combining culture-enriched meta- genomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics, we will determine taxa-function relationships at the sub-spe- cies level and power statistical models that predict the impact of EL exposures on strain diversification, microbe- function associations, and transcriptional activity. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that ELAs acutely alter strain dynamics and stimulate HGT and that the GM response to ELA can be predicted from baseline composition and function. Here, we will interrogate 160 stools flanking variable ELA exposure in 80 preterm neonates in the first 4 months of life, combining culture-enriched metagenomics with selective culture and isolate sequencing to char- acterize the preterm `plasmidome' and profile post-ELA strain dynamics and HGT. To identify microbiome-intrin- sic responses to ELA, we will utilize an innovative transgenerational mouse model where germ-free dams receive human, preterm, microbiota that is vertically transferred to their pups, which are treated with parenteral antibiot- ics. We will use the resulting data to predict individual GM responses to specific antibiotics based on composition, resistance gene content, and bacterial functions. Our proposal is innovative because our interdisciplinary re- search team will characterize strain-level bacterial functions to understand the heterogeneity of GM responses to EL perturbations on two pre-existing sets of human specimens; it is significant because it will identify features that predict species-resolved GM-specific responses to EL selection. Our work will advance pediatric microbi- ome research by comprehensively characterizing strain-resolved functional maturation and GM disruption to understand individual variation leading towards a future of personalized, microbiome medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study addresses our gap in understanding how the early life human gut microbiome responds to diet and antibiotics, including impacts on functional maturation and horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance. This research is relevant for public health because it will improve our understanding of the effects of antibiotics and diet on microbiome dynamics beyond the coarse level of microbial communities and establish predictive models for future personalized antibiotic treatment and dietary recommendations that minimize collateral damage and maximize development of the healthy infant microbiome. By complementing data from two unique human cohorts with hypothesis testing in a mouse model this project is relevant to the NIH's mission of leveraging basic research in mechanisms of health and disease to improve outcomes in treatment and maintenance of human health.",Impact of early-life perturbations on pediatric microbiome maturation,10298201,R01AI155893,"['9 year old', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Birth', 'Carbohydrates', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'Human Milk', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Mobile Genetic Elements', 'Modeling', 'Neonatal', 'Patients', 'Plasmids', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Salvelinus', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vitamins', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'amino acid metabolism', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'cohort', 'de novo mutation', 'dietary', 'early life exposure', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'infant gut microbiome', 'innovation', 'metabolomics', 'metatranscriptomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preterm newborn', 'pup', 'repository', 'resistance gene', 'response', 'risk prediction']",NIAID,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,756349
"Developmental Neurotoxicity Human Neurosphere Assay Data Collection - task order 1 There is global concern that neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability, and other learning disabilities) are rising in populations worldwide, and that environmental exposures may be contributing factors. Current methods to evaluate environmental compounds with unknown developmental neurotoxicity potential remain largely ineffective due to the complexity of neurodevelopment with its multiple key processes, one or more of which might be perturbed by an environmental agent. An integrated testing strategy for developmental neurotoxicity that incorporates novel and innovative methods could better inform public health decisions on developmental neurotoxicity hazards and how they might contribute to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. The developing nervous system is more vulnerable to chemical exposure than the adult nervous system. Vulnerability of the developing nervous systems results from the emergence of key neurodevelopmental cellular processes (i.e., proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, synaptogenesis, network maturation) during temporally defined, and tightly regulated prenatal and postnatal developmental stages. Exposure to environmental chemicals during the ontogeny of these key neurodevelopmental events may cause adverse effects in a dose and/or time-dependent manner.  To address this concern, there is global consensus on the need for the development of a new framework to identify compounds with developmental neurotoxicity potential more effectively. The National Toxicology Program is uniquely positioned to advance the field of developmental neurotoxicity due to its mission of timely advancement of public health, combined with having resources, research flexibility, expertise, and continual engagement with stakeholders. The National Toxicology Program envisions developing and implementing new tools and technologies for both in vitro, and in vivo testing to be able to identify, prioritize, and predict compounds with potential for developmental neurotoxicity. Importantly, this data will be freely and publicly accessible.  Herein, we propose to create a battery of assays that cover key neurodevelopmental cellular processes of proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and neural network maturation for the National Toxicology Program to test classes of compounds with developmental neurotoxicity potential rapidly and efficiently.  The battery includes high readiness 2D or 3D in vitro assays and complementary animal models and will cover several key neurodevelopmental processes that serve as a critical step for prioritization, mechanistic understanding, and potential for further testing. The battery will be challenged by testing >100 chemicals that are known neurotoxicants, have known developmental neurotoxicity in humans but unknown in animals, or have unknown but suspected developmental neurotoxicity potential with widespread human exposure (flame retardants, BPA analogs, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, thallium, strobilurins).   Key words: public health, developmental neurotoxicity, neurodevelopmental disorders, environmental exposures, cellular processes, endocrine disruptors, flame retardants, bisphenol-A (BPA) analogs, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), thallium, strobilurins, botanicals. n/a",Developmental Neurotoxicity Human Neurosphere Assay Data Collection - task order 1,10475425,5N96021D00006,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytes', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Botanicals', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contractor', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'End Point Assay', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Flame Retardants', 'Generations', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Liquid substance', 'Methods', 'Migration Assay', 'Mission', 'Morphology', 'NPC1 gene', 'National Toxicology Program', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuroglia', 'Neuronal Differentiation', 'Neurons', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nuclear Pore Complex', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Solvents', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thallium', 'Time', 'analog', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'cell type', 'cytotoxicity', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'environmental agent', 'environmental chemical', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'in vivo evaluation', 'innovation', 'migration', 'nerve stem cell', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'novel', 'oligodendrocyte progenitor', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'response', 'screening', 'stem cell proliferation', 'synaptogenesis', 'tool']",NIEHS,LEIBNIZ-INSTITUT FUR UMWELTMEDIZINISCHE FORSCHUNG AN DER HEINRICH-HEINE UIVERSITY,N02,2021,369797
