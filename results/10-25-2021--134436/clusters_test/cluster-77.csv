"The UCSC Genome Browser This proposal describes plans to maintain and extend the UCSC Genome Browser at https://genome.ucsc.edu/ and its related web pages, databases, and computer programs. The web-based Genome Browser tool has been used by hundreds of thousands of biomedical researchers who seek to understand the human genome and those of other animals, particularly vertebrates and model organisms. The browser aggregates the research results of hundreds of biomedical labs – including a wide range of biochemical assays, genetic studies, curational efforts, sequencing projects, computer analyses, and text-mining of scientific literature – into a series of tracks aligned to the underlying DNA sequence. The genome provides a natural integration framework for these diverse data sources, which the browser exploits to its fullest at a variety of display scales ranging from the single base to individual genes, entire chromosomes, and ultimately to the genome as a whole. The Genome Browser is implemented using robust, fast, high-quality software capable of handling over one million hits per day. This web software provides a window into an exceptionally detailed and well-documented database that can be queried computationally as well as browsed graphically. The database is loaded with a suite of programs, developed both at UCSC and elsewhere, capable of distilling huge genomics data sets into high-quality annotations of the genome. Significant engineering effort is invested to ensure the quality of the software and data sets, including those developed by external contributors. We aim to extend the software and database in significant ways. We plan to develop displays for personal, family, and tumor genomes that will help researchers separate significant mutations from the background of other genetic variation. We will make it possible to view regions together in a single window that are separate in the linear structure of the chromosome, but in close proximity in the higher-order three-dimensional structure, or that are related by biochemical pathways, homology, or other relationships. We plan to develop a version of the browser optimized for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. We will improve the search capabilities we offer, particularly of large remote datasets. We will continue to import genome assemblies for species of biomedical interest, and integrate a broad range of useful new genomic data from the scientific community, including the ENCODE project. We will collaborate in developing and deploying data exchange standards such as file formats, APIs, and controlled vocabularies that help other groups leverage our resource and extend the reach of the browser to any dataset in compliance with the APIs. We will support this work with effective scientific, project, and personnel management; a plan for broadly disseminating the software tools, libraries, source code and data; and well-established training and outreach mechanisms. The UCSC Genome Browser is a web-based tool that helps biomedical scientists understand the human genome and the genomes of many other species. It integrates the research work of scientific labs worldwide into a series of annotation tracks aligned to the DNA sequence from the Human Genome Project and related genome-sequencing efforts. Through the use of the browser, scientists and doctors can better understand the functions of genomic regions and the consequences of DNA variations observed in individuals.",The UCSC Genome Browser,10236408,U41HG002371,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Assay', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Education and Outreach', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Mutation', 'Online Systems', 'Other Genetics', 'Personnel Management', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Source Code', 'Tablets', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer genome', 'computer program', 'data exchange', 'diverse data', 'file format', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'text searching', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'web page', 'web site', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U41,2021,3571987
"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10304760,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzymes', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'HIV', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Length', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct', 'tool']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2021,52000
"Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The information content of DNA is not limited to the primary sequence (A, C, G, T), but is also conveyed by chemical modifications of individual bases. For example, DNA methylation, specifically 5-methylcytosine (5mC), has been widely studied for its important regulatory roles in human development and diseases. In addition, the discovery of active demethylation of 5mC, mediated by TET enzymes, into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) revealed great insights into the dynamic nature of the human methylome and its close relevance to multiple human diseases. Beyond these chemical modifications to cytosine, recent studies by us and others discovered that N6-methyladenine (6mA), another form of methylation previously thought exclusively existing in bacteria and protozoa, also exists in eukaryotic genomes including the human genome. In addition to these epigenetic marks, different forms of DNA damages represent another category of DNA chemical modifications that are of important biological relevance. Although a few methods for mapping individual chemical modifications have been developed and some are widely used, it is usually hard for broad researchers to master every protocol to map each form of modification. While third- generation sequencing technologies support the direct detection of DNA modifications, they face fundamental challenges distinguishing among different forms of modifications. The objective of this project is to develop a novel technology for the direct mapping of multiple forms of DNA methylation and DNA damage events simultaneously. The core idea is that each form of nucleic acid modification has a unique signature in terms of their physical interaction with DNA polymerase, or nanopores in third-generation sequencing; and these signatures can be modeled by deep learning methods. We will develop this technology using multiple innovative strategies to address a few fundamental challenges, and then comprehensively evaluate the technology to facilitate broad applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chemical DNA modifications are crucial components of human genome that controls many important biological processes in human development and human diseases. In this project, we will develop a novel technology for direct mapping of multiple and specific forms of DNA modifications, which will enable us and a large number of researchers to more effectively study the functions of DNA modifications in human genome.",Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome,10204438,R01HG011095,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Performance', 'Ploidies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protozoa', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Technology', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer risk', 'cell type', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'demethylation', 'exome', 'experience', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'methylome', 'nanopore', 'network models', 'new technology', 'prototype', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,833051
"Computational Methods for Inferring Single-cell DNA Methylation and its Spatial Landscape Project Summary/Abstract The candidate, Wenpin Hou, PhD, is an applied mathematician and computational biologist serving as a postdoctoral fellow of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH). Her long-term career goal is to improve clinical practice in therapy for diseases by developing computational and statistical methods to decipher spatial and temporal gene regulatory programs using multi-omics data and implementing these methods into developmental process and diseases. The research she proposes entitled Computational Methods for Inferring Single-cell DNA Methylation and its Spatial Landscape combines advanced spatial transcriptomics techniques with computational methods to infer spatial DNA methylation landscape, which enables the accurate evaluation of the epigenomic spatial variability and epigenomic targets in therapy for diseases. Dr. Hou completed her PhD in Mathematics at The University of Hong Kong where she focused on inferring and controlling gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Her ﬁrst postdoctoral research (2017-2019) with Drs. Aravinda Chakravarti and Suchi Saria at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) represented the ﬁrst shift in focus of GRNs from theoretical to computational genomics. Her second postdoctoral research (2019-present) with Drs. Hongkai Ji and Stephanie Hicks at JHSPH has further provided complementary training in reconstructing and predicting spatial transcriptomic and epigenomic landscape using single-cell data. Dr. Hou's mentoring team consists of Hongkai Ji (primary mentor), PhD, an expert in developing computational and statistical tools for analyzing single-cell genomic data, including reconstructing and predicting temporal and spatial transcriptomic and epigenomic landscape; Stephanie Hicks (co-mentor), PhD, an expert in developing statistical methods to address technical variability and spatial transcriptomics in single cells; and Andrew Feinberg (co-mentor), PhD, one of the founders of the ﬁeld of cancer epigenetics who directs the ﬁrst NIH funded Epigenome Center. This offers the opportunity to tackle signiﬁcant challenges in the intersection of statistics, epigenomics and spatial transcriptomics with advanced experimental techniques. Her scientiﬁc advisors are Drs. Kasper Hansen, Gregory Hager and Xiaobin Wang who have leading expertise in computational epigenomics, deep learning, clinical translation and disease prevention, respectively. Leveraging the intellectual, experimental, and computing resources from all mentors and advisors as well as through JHSPH, JHU and Johns Hopkins Medicine, Dr. Hou will receive intensive training, mentoring and career development to achieve the goals proposed in this application and have productive outcomes during the award period. Aim 1 will develop methods to predict DNA methylation landscape using bulk gene expression. Aim 2 will develop methods to predict single-cell DNA methylation and differential DNA methylation. Aim 3 will reconstruct tissue-spatial DNA methylation landscape at the single-cell level, generate evaluation datasets in spatial context, and perform across-study assessments using data from The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), Human Cell Atlas, and Recount2. Project Narrative Genomic and epigenomic abnormalities collaborate in disease initiation and progression, as exempliﬁed by frequent mutations in protein-coding genes which can vary spatially in separated sub-regions of tissues. This project will develop computational methods to infer tissue-spatial epigenomic landscape which can not be measured using current techniques, leveraging the emerging technologies of spatial transcriptomics, and develop novel statistical methods to identify differential epigenomic signals across patients or cell populations. The outcome of this project can lead to the development of new epigenetic targeted therapy and new epigenetic therapeutic drugs for various diseases that helps the broad community.",Computational Methods for Inferring Single-cell DNA Methylation and its Spatial Landscape,10104023,K99HG011468,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hong Kong', 'Human', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disease classification', 'disorder prevention', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'programs', 'reference genome', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,115909
"Pan-disease characterization of DNA methylation dysregulation DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark with a regulated pattern in healthy tissues. Disruption of this pattern, called methylation dysregulation, has been reported in many diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases, metabolic and psychological disorders, and diseases related to aging. Importantly, methylation dysregulation has been observed in pre-disease states and the degree of dysregulation correlates with disease severity and also response to treatment. These observations compel the study of methylation dysregulation because it may reveal common origins of human disease, and because genomic elements (e.g. genes, mutations, and regulatory features) associated with methylation dysregulation may be potential targets for diagnostic and early intervention therapies. However, the genomic elements that control and maintain methylation dysregulation have not been well-characterized. Understanding the mechanisms and pathways that are responsible for the establishment of epigenetic dysregulation is critical for understanding the establishment of the disease phenotype in general. We hypothesize that specific genomic elements could contribute to methylation dysregulation in reproducible ways across diseases. This research seeks to identify genomic elements that may initiate a disease state that is common across multiple diseases. This will be accomplished by the development of computational algorithms to leverage and integrate patient samples from many diseases, as well as the development of a new high-throughput genomic screen. Specifically, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Identification of genes associated with methylation dysregulation using a pan-disease machine-learning approach; (2) Exploration of the contribution of the noncoding genome to methylation dysregulation through analysis of  genome variants and chromatin accessibility data; (3) Development and validation of a novel CRISPR screen to link gene perturbations to methylation  landscapes in a high-throughput manner. In summary, completion of these aims will produce an in-depth characterization of the genomic elements associated with methylation dysregulation, leading to understanding of the processes and mechanisms of epigenetic dysregulation. More broadly, the proposed analysis framework and computational approach will explore the utility of integrative pan-disease studies to identify common characteristics of disease which could lead to diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. This proposal takes advantage of the applicant's expertise in genetics, genomics, and high-throughput assays. It also includes training and research experience in experimental design and execution which will advance the candidate's goal of becoming an independent research scientist capable of investigating genome function, specifically the genomic origins of human disease. DNA methylation patterns are dysregulated in many human diseases, suggesting that elements of disease initiation may be common across diseases. The proposed research aims to characterize pan-disease patterns of methylation dysregulation and to identify genes and regulators that lead to methylation dysregulation. This will contribute to fundamental knowledge of disease initiation and identify potential targets for disease diagnosis and treatment.",Pan-disease characterization of DNA methylation dysregulation,10191781,K99HG011658,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Designs', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'large datasets', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2021,170402
"Genomic medicine and gene function implementation for an underserved population PROJECT SUMMARY Here we propose to advance the goal of NHGRI to implement genomic medicine and focus on individuals who have not been able to afford DNA testing. The research takes place in the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and Texas Childrens Hospital (TCH). Our team of clinicians, geneticists, computer scientists, genomicists and model organism researchers has had a five-year term of success with the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) Model Organisms Screening Center (MOSC). This has included successfully identifying a number of new disease genes such as EBF3, IRF2BPL, NACC1, TBX2, TOMM70, CDK19, ACOX1, WDR37, and ATP5F1D. We propose to recruit 100 individuals from an underserved population in Houston, Texas with suspected rare disease and without the means to pay for DNA sequencing through insurance. We will provide whole-exome sequencing which will generate a CAP/CLIA report that we anticipate could diagnose 35-40 individuals per year. The remaining individuals will then be converted to a family-based trio exome design. All the sequencing costs of this project will be covered by philanthrophic donation to our hospital and are not budgeted to the grant. We will make every effort to diagnose the remaining 60 individuals per year through machine learning and informatics using the MARRVEL platform, Drosophila functional studies of candidate genes and through ongoing 6 month, 12 month and 2 year follow-up with the patients where we will use matchmaking efforts such as GeneMatcher and Matchmaker exchange as well as our own genomic databases from the UDN and other studies to come to a genetic diagnosis. All subjects will receive genetic counseling from a trained team and will provide us with valuable medical, psychological and social data to guide how genomic implementation in an underserved population is perceived, impacts care and impacts the family. This work will not only produce novel insights into rare disease, diagnosis for undiagnosed families and an expanded role for genomics, it will guide us in the future to provide genomics and functional research to serve all individuals regardless of their ability to pay. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research study uses DNA sequencing to find a diagnose for families with children with a rare disease who may not be able to afford DNA sequencing studies. We use clinical testing, followed by more extensive computer technology and genetic research using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to study genetic variation in patients with rare and undiagnosed disease.

"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease. In the future, the approaches we develop will lead to software that suggests individualized therapies for patients based on clinical methylation data.",Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation,10168608,R01LM013096,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translating', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'clinical sequencing', 'cofactor', 'demethylation', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'individualized medicine', 'long short term memory network', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'nanopore', 'network architecture', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,366581
"Developing novel deep-learning based methods for deciphering non-coding gene regulatory code SUMMARY This project will contribute novel pre-trained DNA Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, called DNABERT, and associated deep-learning tools to decipher the language of non-coding DNA and facilitate integration of gene regulatory information from rapidly accumulating sequence data with NLM’s genetic databases (for example, dbSNP, dbGaP and ClinVar), which serve both scientists and the public health by helping identify the genetic components of disease. While the genetic code explaining how DNA is translated into proteins is universal, the regulatory code that determines when and how the genes are expressed varies across different cell-types and organisms. Non-coding DNA is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant semantic relationship, from a language modeling perspective. Recently, deep learning methods have been used in unraveling the gene regulatory code, but failed to globally and robustly model such language features in the genome, especially in data-scarce scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose DNABERT to model DNA as a language, by adapting the idea of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Based on recent observations in natural language processing research, we hypothesize that pre-trained transformer-based neural network model offer a promising, and yet not fully explored, deep learning approach for a variety of sequence prediction tasks in the analysis of non-coding DNA. Our preliminary results showed that DNABERT on the human genome achieved state-of-the-art performance on promoter and splice-site prediction tasks, after easy fine-tuning on small task-specific data (Ji, Y. et al. 2020). The goal of our proposed research is to develop DNABERT for a variety of sequence prediction tasks, and benchmark with existing state- of-the-art deep-learning based methods. Specific aims are (1) develop novel deep-learning methods by adapting BERT; (2) apply the proposed deep-learning methods to specifically target non-coding DNA sequence analyses and predictions; and (3) predict and validate functional non-coding genetic variants by applying DNABERT prediction models. A major contribution of the proposed research is development of pre-trained DNABERT model and prediction algorithms, which present new powerful methods for analyses and predictions of DNA sequences. Since the pre-training of DNABERT is resource-intensive, we will provide the source code and pre-trained model at Github for future academic research. We will also develop an integrated web server to (1) deploy DNABERT model, (2) database to store the identified sequence features and predictions, and (3) tutorials to help users to apply DNABERT to their specific research problems. We anticipate that DNABERT can bring new advancements and insights to the bioinformatics community by bringing advanced language modeling perspective to gene regulation analyses. Public health relevance statement: The disruption of numerous human genes and their isoforms driven by non-coding genetic variants is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism. This project will contribute novel pre-trained deep-learning tools to decipher the language of non- coding DNA and facilitate integration of gene regulatory information from rapidly accumulating sequence data with NLM’s genetic databases (for example, dbSNP, dbGaP and ClinVar), which serve both scientists and the public health by helping identify the genetic components of disease.",Developing novel deep-learning based methods for deciphering non-coding gene regulatory code,10232749,R01LM013722,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'ChIP-seq', 'ClinVar', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genome', 'Label', 'Language', 'Luciferases', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organism', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Performance', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'dbSNP', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'human DNA', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'web server']",NLM,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2021,345594
"Epigenetic and transcriptomic determinants of Sjogren's Syndrome subtypes utilizing data from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) cohort ABSTRACT  Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease affecting the exocrine system, with hallmark symptoms of dry mouth and/or dry eyes caused by the dysfunction of salivary and/or lacrimal glands, respectively. While Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and other studies have increased our knowledge of genetic risk factors for SS, the disease etiology remains not well understood, and such risk factors have not been translatable to any immunological treatment options for SS. The NIH-NIDCR-funded Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) was established to improve the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of patients with SS by developing/validating standardized classification criteria for SS; and developing a rich biospecimen repository with clinical data to be used for future epidemiologic, pathogenesis, and genetic studies of SS.[1, 2] For this project, we will focus on genomic data and measures of the 2016 ACR-EULAR classification criteria, involving ocular, oral, and autoantibody manifestations. As shown in our previous work, the genetics of SS varies with ancestry; thus, we will cluster patients by both the criteria subphenotypes and genetic ancestry. We believe that accounting for disease heterogeneity in this way will enable us to more precisely identify disease pathways and mechanisms. Using previously secured funding, we are completing DNA methylation typing on LSGs in 373 SICCA patients and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on PBMCs of 86 SICCA patients who also have DNA methylation profiling. This data provides a unique opportunity for multi-omics analysis to determine correlates between LSG tissue epigenetics, peripheral blood cell-type distributions and cell-specific gene expression by SS subsets. First, using GWAS data and DNA methylation data from LSG biopsies, we will identify genetic and epigenetic modifications associated with subtypes of SS in SICCA patients. We will then examine the relationships between them by testing for genotype-specific methylation and expression, and utilizing mendelian randomization and causal inference testing to investigate causality between these measures. Second, we will analyze scRNAseq data to identify how cell types, states and cell- specific gene expression correlate with SS subtypes. Finally, we will integrate genetics, epigenetics, and transcriptomics to determine multi-omics profiles associated with SS subtypes. We will jointly model associated features from the genomic data to investigate causal pathways via correlation networks, conditional analysis, and machine learning. We anticipate that SS subtypes will exhibit specific relationships within the multi- omics data and that this will advance our understanding of SS disease processes, leading to better treatment targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposal leverages unique NIDCR-funded resources by utilizing existing infrastructure and data with high level expertise to better understand the pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome and identify new therapeutic pathways. We propose to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data recently generated on patients of the Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) biorepository/registry. We will identify genomic determinants of subtypes of SS derived from subphenotypes and genetic ancestry, which we believe will be more indicative of underlying biologic pathways and will lead to more appropriate genomic candidates for SS treatments.",Epigenetic and transcriptomic determinants of Sjogren's Syndrome subtypes utilizing data from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) cohort,10259816,R03DE029800,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'American', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Biological', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Cells', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exanthema', 'Exhibits', 'Exocrine System', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Immunologics', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Laboratories', 'Lacrimal gland structure', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'college', 'differential expression', 'disease heterogeneity', 'epigenome', 'eye dryness', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'methylation testing', 'monocyte', 'multiple omics', 'novel therapeutics', 'repository', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2021,161500
"REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  PROJECT SUMMARY  DNA motifs bind transcription factors (TFs) that control gene expression in normal and diseased skin. AR45192 recently mapped the enhancers and promoters that are sequentially activated during epidermal differentiation, and found them enriched for 15 conserved DNA motif combinations, or DNA motif “grammars”. This suggested that these grammars, acting through recruitment of motif-binding TFs, may encode the DNA sequence logic that coordinates the temporal and spatial induction of early and late epidermal differentiation genes. AR45192 also found that these grammars were recurrently altered by single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs, for “expression SNPs”) linked by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to skin diseases characterized by disrupted epidermal differentiation, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This suggests that newly identified DNA motif grammars may control differentiation and that their disruption may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  Aim I will test the hypothesis that specific DNA motif grammars control the physiologic activation of differentiation genes necessary for normal epidermal function. First, it will define the temporal activity of hundreds of examples of each grammar in early and late differentiation within intact epidermis. Second, it will quantitate epidermal differentiation gene expression and barrier function in isogenic epidermal tissues in which a subset of grammars have been altered by gene-editing. Aim I is designed to characterize the actions of newly identified DNA motif grammars in epidermal differentiation.  Aim II will test the hypothesis that SCC risk eSNPs residing within epidermal differentiation motif grammars alter gene expression in a way that enhances cancer progression. First, it will define SCC eSNP impacts on gene expression in normal epidermis with a goal to understanding the altered target genes, and their biologic functions, that predispose to SCC risk. Second, it will quantitatively assess the impact of these SCC risk eSNPs, singly and in combination, on neoplastic progression of epidermal neoplasia in vivo. Aim II is designed to define the impact of regulatory DNA variants on epidermal gene expression and disease progression.  This AR45192 competing renewal will characterize the role of newly identified regulatory DNA grammars in epidermal homeostasis and neoplastic progression. RELEVANCE  Abnormal differentiation is a hallmark of common skin diseases, such as epidermal cancers, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and certain ichthyoses. Transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA motifs in enhancers to control differentiation gene expression in skin and other tissues. Characterizing the patterns of normal and disease-linked DNA sequence motifs that control epidermal differentiation may be of broad utility in the future treatment and prevention of skin disorders. REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  Project Narrative The control of gene expression determines the health or disease of human tissues, including skin. Systematic definition of the regulatory DNA motif combinations in homeostasis and early cancer progression is designed to provide information to advance human health for skin and other tissues. 1",REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION,10107766,R01AR045192,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dependovirus', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Future', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Ichthyoses', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-in', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Reporter', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'design', 'gene induction', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'keratinocyte differentiation', 'neural network algorithm', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'skin barrier', 'skin disorder', 'skin squamous cell carcinoma', 'transcription factor', 'tumor progression']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,459691
"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time.

"Molecular images and machine learning to extract placental function from maternal cfDNA Abstract  Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state. cfDNA is fragmented with sizes centered around 145bp and 166bp which is approximately the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome, and a nucleosome plus its linker, respectively. Shorter fragments (30-100bp) also exist and have a clear periodicity of 10bp, corresponding to a turn of the DNA helix wrapped around the core histone. Recent reports have shown that the fragmentation sizes of cfDNA are tissue specific, which is a product of distinct nucleosome spacing that is inherent in the function of individual tissues. When these individual fragments are compared with existing epigenetic data from tissues, they can be binned into cell of origin simply based on whether they reveal the nucleosome positioning information of the originating tissue. Identifying cfDNA fragments of placental origin from maternal circulation would provide a non-invasive means of assessing placental function during human pregnancy.  Several major barriers inhibit cfDNA as a non-invasive method for examining placental function: 1) the ability to accurately identify the placental origin of the short <160bp cfDNA fragments that constitute regulatory information (paternal SNPs occur at frequency of approximately 1/2000bp). 2) the ability to use these fragments to piece together precise epigenetic states of the placenta. 3) the cost of deep whole genome sequencing that has traditionally been required to deconvolute epigenetic profiles of admixed cellular origins. Our goal is to overcome each of these barriers by exploiting state-of-the-art genomics and machine learning techniques to extract precise information about human placental function from cfDNA. We will first compile robust and accurate nucleosome information, including epigenetic and transcription factor occupancy, from the human placenta and then we will establish machine-learning platforms to elucidate placental cfDNA from maternal circulation at low cost. Success in this project will enable earlier intervention for high-risk pregnancies and facilitate the longitudinal, non-invasive real-time monitoring of pregnancy progression, thereby informing adaptive treatment decision-making. Narrative Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state.

"ClinTAD: A Tool for Improving Clinical CNV Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT DNA microarray is a routine clinical pediatric diagnostic test to identify genomic copy number variants (CNVs) that could be causative of autism, developmental delay, and multiple congenital anomalies. This test is also used frequently in the prenatal setting to find genomic causes of fetal anomalies found by ultrasound, or to predict potential phenotypes postnatally. Current clinical guidelines for interpretation of CNVs focus solely on the characteristics of genes contained within the CNV breakpoints. However, recent studies on chromatin architecture, utilizing Hi-C or related techniques, have demonstrated that CNVs can also disrupt the structure of topologically associated domains (TADs). TADs are “neighborhoods” of physical DNA interactions that serve several functions, including the prevention of ectopic gene-enhancer interactions. This TAD disruption can lead to pathogenic alterations in transcription of genes outside the CNV region that are ultimately causative of disease. The central hypothesis of this proposal is by only focusing on genes within the CNV region for clinical interpretation, critical genomic information is being entirely ignored in DNA microarray interpretation, ultimately leading to missed diagnoses for patients. To address this issue, we have recently developed the free-to-use software ClinTAD (www.clintad.com; J Hum Genet (2019)) to assist in the interpretation of CNVs while taking potential TAD disruption into account. To our knowledge, this is the first software of its kind to attempt to integrate TADs into clinical CNV interpretation. While ClinTAD v1.0 is currently available as a decision support tool to assist in clinical practice, it is currently limited both in its ease-of-use as well as its predictive power. Further enhancing the utility of ClinTAD motivates the two Aims of our proposal here: 1) We aim to optimize ClinTAD as both a clinical decision support and research tool by allowing incorporation of TAD boundaries from different datasets, enabling an API for analysis of large case cohorts, adding interpretation tools for Regions of Homozygosity found on SNP array, and allowing for creation of a de-identified database where users can upload cases with suspicion for pathogenicity based on TAD disruption. 2) We aim to improve the predictive power of ClinTAD through machine learning to identify the most predictive features of pathogenicity in a large, publicly available CNV cohorts, as well as by incorporating a recently-described convolutional neural network-based model which can predict TAD disruption as a function of CNV breakpoints. In this proposal we aim to make ClinTAD the premier tool for the interpretation of CNVs in the context of TAD disruption. Our long- term goal is to build a collaborative network of users that will enable us to identify patients with the most probability of having clinical phenotypes caused by TAD disruption. Such a unique patient cohort could then form the basis of a first-of-its kind trial to evaluate the utility of Hi-C as a clinical test. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with conditions such as autism, developmental delay, and other abnormalities found at birth frequent have a medical test done called DNA microarray. While this test is certainly useful, we believe that this test is missing the correct diagnosis in some patients because of limitations in current guidelines for interpreting test data. Here we aim to further improve our free-to-use software tool, called ClinTAD, to help make these correct diagnoses in patients that are currently being missed.",ClinTAD: A Tool for Improving Clinical CNV Interpretation,10286951,R03HD105804,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Benign', 'Birth', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Microarray Chip', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Fireflies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genets', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hi-C', 'Interruption', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Cytogenetics', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recessive Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'SNP array', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Weight', 'application programming interface', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'congenital anomaly', 'convolutional neural network', 'expectation', 'experience', 'fetal', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'research clinical testing', 'support tools', 'tool', 'uptake', 'usability', 'web site']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2021,80750
"An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in next generation–sequencing (NGS)-based molecular methods have illuminated the hierarchical organization of the genome and have shown that changes in the epigenome can promote or prevent the access of transcription factors (TFs) to specific DNA sequences, move genes between nuclear compartments, and build or remove the insulation between neighboring genomic regions. As changes in the epigenome and chromatin organization can derail precise transcriptional regulatory programs to change cell differentiation status or induce a pathological state, research in Dr. Li’s laboratory seeks to improve our ability to define and understand the impact of such changes across multiple layers of transcriptional regulation in the cell. The laboratory has effectively addressed the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in its previous and ongoing work and now extends its focus to hydroxymethylation. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is a key epigenetic modification linked to transcriptional activation; however, 5hmC data and its genome properties have thus far been evaluated with limited integration of different genomic data types. Moreover, there is no integrative computational framework designed to interpret the functional role of 5hmC in the context of 5-methycytosine (5mC), enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, gene expression data, and DNA sequence information. This proposal will fill the growing need for user-friendly, interpretable, and extendable tools for mining 5hmC data toward laying a foundation for basic mechanistic studies of the epigenome and facilitate discovery of potential therapeutic targets in disease. Building on the investigator’s progress in revealing the dynamics of 5hmC and its impact on gene regulation, the proposal will now develop innovative computational tools for 5hmC data mining and data integration with other NGS datasets, with a focus on applying these tools to B cell differentiation, cancer, and embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Key goals over the next five years include developing a computational framework to mine short- and long-read sequencing data to answer the following questions: (1) How does 5hmC contribute to epigenetic heterogeneity? (2) How does 5hmC epigenetic heterogeneity contribute to transcriptome heterogeneity? (3) How do 5hmC levels and epigenetic heterogeneity communicate with histone modifications, enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, and chromatin organization? We will combine machine learning and network mining algorithms to enable knowledge discovery and data integration from diverse genomic data types. We will then harness the 5hmC data-mining framework to identify 5hmC patterns that correlate with ESC differentiation, B cell differentiation, and that contribute to the fitness advantage of cancer cells. This work is significant because it will be the first dissection of 5hmC’s contribution to local and long-range epigenetic heterogeneity and the first computational framework to uncover the cross-talk between DNA modifications and other transcriptional regulators via chromatin interaction data. Collectively, this work will yield a fuller picture of the molecular events that underlie fundamental changes in cell state and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Modifications of the genome that do not change the sequence of the DNA, called epigenetic modifications, can impact how genes are expressed and lead healthy cells into a disease state. Here we propose to develop computational tools to define how one type of epigenetic modification, called hydroxymethylation, impacts gene expression and ultimately cell behavior. These tools will be versatile and adaptable to any cell type of choice, enabling research into the molecular features of the genome that underlie both normal and pathological cell behaviors.",An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation,10210409,R35GM133562,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'B cell differentiation', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenome', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'next generation sequencing', 'prevent', 'programs', 'stem cell differentiation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2021,472500
"From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding how the genome functions is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Encoded within its DNA sequences are the blueprints for several cell types. Nevertheless, it remains a mystery how the full variety of phenotypes arise, and how they are maintained. It is becoming increasingly clear that the epigenome— covalent modifications to the DNA and histone proteins—plays a crucial role. Genome-wide profiling of epigenetic modifications has clarified cell type specificity and the presence of a diverse set of combinatorial patterns that are strongly correlated with gene expression levels. Inferring causal relationships from these data has proved challenging, however. A working knowledge of the mechanisms that inform the establishment and regulation of the epigenome, and its impact on gene expression and cellular phenotype, therefore, remain elusive. In this project, we propose several novel modeling approaches which will address the key gaps in our understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and genome. First, we will parameterize a coarse- grained chromatin model from the bottom-up using a novel deep learning algorithm to generate an accurate and comprehensive characterization of chromatin secondary structure, and its sensitivity to DNA sequence, nucleosome repeat length, ionic concentrations, post-translational modifications, and phase-separated liquid- droplets formed by intrinsically disordered proteins. High resolution chromatin structures from this effort will elucidate how different epigenetic modifications impact gene expression by regulating nucleosome packaging and DNA accessibility. Second, we will investigate the role of epigenetic modifications in mediating long-range interactions between regulatory elements by developing a predictive model which will enable de novo reconstruction of three-dimensional genome organization. This project will result in a global view of the role of the epigenome in cell differentiation and cell fate determination. An improved understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and the genome from this research program can guide the development of engineering approaches to modify the epigenome for both long lasting and reversible changes as a novel strategy for combating diseases such as cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE The epigenome works hand-in-hand with the genome to encode cell phenotypic diversity for multicellular organisms. We will apply interdisciplinary approaches to disentangle the interrelationship between the two, thus elucidating the role of the genome in establishing and maintaining a robust epigenome, and providing mechanistic insight into epigenetic regulations of the genome’s function. Insights from our study will pave the way for rational epigenome engineering which holds great potential for transforming medicine and biotechnology.",From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization,10178047,R35GM133580,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Back', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Chromatin Structure', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Grain', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Work', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2021,377555
"Computational Models of the Human Cell Cycle to Reveal Disease Mechanism and Inform Treatment PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The overall goal of this project is to develop computational models that predict how the human cell cycle responds to clinically-relevant perturbations such as radiotherapy, targeted therapy, oncogenic mutation, and directed differentiation. These models will fill a significant void in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the initiation, progression, and treatment of diseases that involve abnormal cell proliferation. Our approach is to use quantitative single-cell imaging to measure the molecular states of proliferating cells and to integrate these data into predictive modeling frameworks. We have assembled a cross-institutional team comprising a computational biologist, two cell biologists, and a physician scientist with specialization in radiation oncology. The team has a strong and productive history of collaboration with six joint publications to date. Aim 1 investigates the mechanism by which retinal epithelial cells respond to radiation-induced DNA damage during S phase to execute G2 arrest. Time-lapse imaging and deterministic modeling will predict: how the response to DNA damage is delayed until the S/G2 transition; how a small-molecule inhibitor of DNA repair—currently involved in clinical trial—intensifies the arrest response; and how loss of the tumor suppressor p53 renders cells refractory to combination therapy. Aim 2 asks how pancreatic epithelial cells with mutations in KRAS escape permanent cell cycle arrest. We will use high-content imaging to profile multiple signaling activities in single cells expressing oncogenic KRAS. These data will be used to construct a manifold representation of cell cycle progression that spans a two-week time course of oncogenic KRAS-mediated transformation. Computational analysis of the manifold’s geometry will identify molecular branching points in G1 that govern the proliferation/arrest decision in pancreatic cells, and we will validate these predictions through small molecules and genetic manipulation. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that human embryonic stem cells inherit cell-cycle-specific gene products (specifically, G1 regulators) from the previous G2 phase to promote pluripotency in daughter cells. We will combine mitosis-specific chromatin profiling with convolutional neural network-based image analysis to identify the mechanisms by which stem cells sustain rapid proliferation and pluripotency over multiple cell-cycle generations. Each aim yields both basic and applied knowledge, providing fundamental insights into cell cycle progression under perturbation and generating specific, molecular predictions to inform new treatment schemes. With an eye toward the future, predictive models of the human cell cycle will enable patient-specific treatments for diseases that are driven by abnormal cell proliferation. NARRATIVE Many human diseases involve abnormalities in the cell cycle—the process by which cells duplicate their DNA to form two daughter cells. This project will develop computational models that can predict how the human cell cycle responds to radiation and targeted therapy; a mutation commonly observed in pancreatic cancer; and treatments used to regenerate epithelial tissues from human stem cells. Successful completion of these aims will advance our basic understanding of the human cell cycle and inform our ability to treat disease by altering cell cycle progression.",Computational Models of the Human Cell Cycle to Reveal Disease Mechanism and Inform Treatment,10261500,R01GM138834,"['Abnormal Cell', 'Activity Cycles', 'Behavior', 'CCNE1 gene', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell division', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Cyclin D1', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Inhibition', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoderm', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Future', 'G2 Phase', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth Factor Receptors', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'KRAS oncogenesis', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncogenic', 'Organ', 'PI3K/AKT', 'Pancreas', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Publications', 'RAS Family Gene', 'RAS genes', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Induced DNA Damage', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'S Phase', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'cancer therapy', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'daughter cell', 'design', 'differentiation protocol', 'epithelium regeneration', 'expectation', 'extracellular', 'gene product', 'genetic manipulation', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human model', 'human stem cells', 'human tissue', 'individualized medicine', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'paracrine', 'pluripotency', 'pluripotency factor', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stem cells', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic DNA', 'transmission process', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,355036
"Development of Technologies for Efficient In Vivo Prime Editing PROJECT SUMMARY  Genome editing is revolutionizing biomedicine and biotechnology by enabling the precise modification of genomic DNA in living cells. While various genome-editing tools have been developed over the past decade, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as a particularly versatile and efficient technology for editing DNA. Nonetheless, limitations derived from its reliance on DNA double strand breaks (DSB), which can lead to unpredictable editing outcomes and even chromosomal translocations, could limit its applications.  Base editors (BEs) and prime editors (PEs) are two novel classes of genome-editing tools capable of introducing precise single-base conversion in DNA without the requirement of a DSB. PEs, in particular, provide greater flexibility than BEs, owing to their ability to introduce any type of base conversion and even programable small insertions and deletions. This expanded set of capabilities compared to other technologies makes PEs a particularly promising platform for applications in biomedicine; however, the large size of PEs precludes their in vivo delivery by AAV, a promising and effective gene delivery vehicle that is currently under evaluation in multiple clinical trials.  To overcome these obstacles, we have created a split-PE platform that is compatible with AAV delivery and have demonstrated the functionality of this approach in cultured cells. Despite this progress, there still remain several critical challenges, which we here propose to overcome in order to optimize this technology for effective and specific in vivo prime editing.  To accomplish this objective, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with collective expertise in genome editing (Dr. Perez-Pinera), AAV gene delivery (Dr. Gaj) and computational biology (Dr. Song). Our collaborative efforts will yield an integrated and comprehensive PE toolset that will blend strategies for target identification and editing optimization, with methods for reducing off-target effects and immune responses, thus priming this technology for future in vivo applications.  Given that the flexibility of PEs has significantly expanded the number of actionable target sites that can be genetically modified, we anticipate that the integrated technologies we develop will have large, direct and long- lasting impact in biomedicine by enabling not only novel gene therapies, but also basic research. In particular, our technology will provide investigators with biological tools that are uniquely capable of introducing mutations within post-mitotic cells in vivo, which could be used to dissect functional elements or even determine the role of pathogenic mutations in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. The technologies created by this application will thus broadly impact biotechnology and biomedicine. NARRATIVE Genome editing technologies provide novel opportunities to advance basic research and treat human diseases but approaches that use active nucleases to edit DNA can induce undesired and deleterious effects in the genome, which can reduce their therapeutic potential. Prime editors are a recently emerged gene-editing variant capable of introducing precise modifications to DNA, with minimal damage to the genome. This proposal is focused on creating an integrative prime editing toolkit that will provide investigators with technologies that will enable their use in vivo, improve their specificity and streamline their design and implementation, thereby advancing the applications of this methodology in biotechnology and biomedicine.",Development of Technologies for Efficient In Vivo Prime Editing,10184207,R01GM141296,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Carrying Capacities', 'Cells', 'Chromosomal translocation', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Biology', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene Delivery', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic approach', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Poly A', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Splicing', 'Variant', 'adeno-associated viral vector', 'base', 'biophysical techniques', 'cell type', 'computational suite', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gene therapy', 'genome editing', 'human disease', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'intein', 'miniaturize', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'reconstitution', 'response', 'success', 'technology development', 'technology research and development', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,535871
"Genomes in 3D: from maps to mechanisms Project Summary In each of our trillions of cells, genetic information is stored on meter-long chromosomes spatially organized inside micron-scale nuclei. In the past decade, large-scale efforts have built increasingly detailed atlases of transcription, regulatory elements, and genome folding across ever-expanding sets of cell types and tissues. Still, these beautiful maps do not by themselves reveal the sequences or molecular mechanisms acting in these diverse cellular contexts. Drawing on approaches from biophysics, bioinformatics, and machine learning, this project will develop novel computational approaches to determine the DNA sequences and mechanisms underlying 3D genome organization, and how this in turn relates to genomic functions. Drawing on the latest breakthroughs in machine learning, we will model how individual nucleotides contribute to genome folding. We will apply these models to characterize cell-type specific genome folding, develop methods to engineer DNA sequences in silico, and model enhancer-promoter influences. Concurrently, we will build biophysical models to understand deeply conserved mechanisms of genome folding. Using meiotic chromosome folding as a model system, we will develop models to learn new rules governing cohesin dynamics and loop extrusion. To uncover how extrusion interfaces with other mechanisms, we will build models of synaptonemal complex assembly, as well as models of meiotic chromosome organization across species. By honing in on the sequences most crucial for locus-specific genome folding and characterizing the mechanisms driving genome- wide folding, the computational models we develop and the mechanisms we discover will enable new approaches to precision genome engineering. This will include how to re-wire gene-regulatory circuits, not only by targeting enhancers and promoters, but also by modulating their cell-type specific communication. At the same time, the aims described here will bridge fundamental insights into 3D chromosome organization with clinical genomics, and greatly improve the interpretability of non-coding DNA variants. Project Narrative Non-coding DNA sequences play crucial roles in gene regulation and the physical organization of the genome, with roles in development and consequences for disease. Using novel biophysical modeling and machine- learning approaches, this project will connect fundamental insights into 3D genome organization with the functional consequences of its disruption. These insights into genome organization will both aid in determining potentially pathogenic genetic variants, and open new frontiers in precision genome engineering.",Genomes in 3D: from maps to mechanisms,10277271,R35GM143116,"['3-Dimensional', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Meiosis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenicity', 'Play', 'Regulator Genes', 'Role', 'Synaptonemal Complex', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'cell type', 'cohesin', 'frontier', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'meter', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R35,2021,412500
"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth in patients with refractory PA disease.",DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth,10224739,R01CA230328,"['Acromegaly', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dura Mater', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hypopituitarism', 'In Vitro', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Pituitary-dependent Cushing&apos', 's disease', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Publishing Peer Reviews', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Somatotropin', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'accurate diagnostics', 'base', 'bone', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional status', 'gene expression variation', 'genome-wide', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'methylome', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision drugs', 'prognostic', 'small hairpin RNA', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,510309
"Software and algorithms for elucidating the structure, function, and evolution of extrachromosomal DNA Project Summary Somatic copy number amplification (SCNA) of tumor promoting oncogenes, and focal copy number amplifi- cations specifically, are a major driver of cancer pathogenicity. Recent results have revealed that that focal oncogene amplification is mediated to a large extent by extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) i.e., large (1.3 Mb on average), highly amplified, oncogene-containing circular molecules that occur in nearly 25% of cancers across all sub-types, but rarely in normal cells. Unresolved questions regarding the formation, evolution, het- erogeneity, and pathogenicity of ecDNA are becoming central to uncovering vulnerabilities that can be targeted for diagnostics and therapy. The proposed project will enhance and disseminate “Software and algorithms for elucidating the structure, function, and evolution of extrachromosomal DNA.” Specifically, we will (1) de- velop CAPER (a Community Accessible Pipeline for EcDNA Reconstruction) by leveraging the GenePattern ecosystem to provide an easy point and click interface to running the CPU, memory and storage heavy soft- ware; (2) design and implement novel algorithmic improvements to the CAPER work flow, including support for long-reads and integration of Omics data; and, (3) enable the broad adoption of CAPER through strategic collaborations, outreach and education. Project Narrative Increased activity of cancer-causing genes (onco-genes) is often due to increased copy numbers mediated by extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). We propose to enhance our software and algorithms for elucidating the structure, function, and evolution of ecDNA and make them available to the research community as user- friendly tools. The resulting resource will enable advances in ecDNA biology and help identify new therapeutic vulnerabilities in currently intractable cancers.","Software and algorithms for elucidating the structure, function, and evolution of extrachromosomal DNA",10305480,U24CA264379,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biology', 'Capers', 'Cations', 'Centromere', 'Cloud Service', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Metaphase', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Normal Cell', 'Oncogenes', 'Optics', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prognosis', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'anticancer research', 'cloud platform', 'computational platform', 'computer infrastructure', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'extrachromosomal DNA', 'genome sequencing', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'reconstruction', 'single molecule', 'supercomputer', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2021,749120
"Predoctoral to Postdoctoral Research Training in ctDNA Biology for Liquid Biopsy of Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) which mirrors the parental tumor, is present in the plasma of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients. Liquid biopsy analysis of ctDNA allows early detection and genetic monitoring. However, current PCR-based liquid biopsy methods often have difficulty detecting ctDNA due to low copies in circulation. In contrast, the electric field-induced release and measurement liquid biopsy (eLB) platform, detects mutant EGFR (L858R, exon19del, T790M) ctDNA with a >90% tissue-genotype concordance in <50ul of unprocessed plasma of NSCLC patients. Preliminary data demonstrate that the ctDNA detected by eLB may be ultrashort single-stranded ctDNA (usssctDNA) which contrasts the typically described 160-basepair internucleosomal double-stranded ctDNA. This new subpopulation is undetectable through PCR-based liquid biopsy methods due to size-selection bias. The goal of the F99 Phase is to use usssctDNA-seq, a novel NGS pipeline, to explore if NSCLC plasma contains high quantities of ctDNA that are ultrashort and single-stranded. This pipeline consists of a usssctDNA-specific extraction, library preparation, deep sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis. To verify, 80 late-stage NSCLC EGFR-mutated plasma samples will undergo usssctDNA-seq. The discovery of usssctDNA will open up a wealth of previously unnoticed information leading to improved treatment and survival of NSCLC patients. Afterward, during the K00 Phase, the trainee hopes to explore the biological origins of biofluid ctDNA and the incorporation of usssctDNA into modern multi-analyte approaches for pan- cancer detection. This will involve training in new skills such as organoid modeling, methylation and leukocyte sequencing, and bioinformatic machine learning at a world-leading cancer-oriented institute. Ultimately, the goal of this proposed F99/K00 project will to prepare the trainee for a career in cancer research with an expertise in liquid biopsy and cell-free DNA biology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research in the first phase of this proposal is to investigate a new methodology to capture and define a novel ultrashort circulating tumor DNA species in the plasma of lung cancer patients. In the second phase, the usage of various other molecules additional to the ultrashort DNA species in biofluids will be explored in hopes to detect multiple cancer types with liquid biopsy. These findings will contribute to improved clinical outcomes for cancer patients by leading to the development of new liquid biopsy approaches for improved detection and treatment monitoring.",Predoctoral to Postdoctoral Research Training in ctDNA Biology for Liquid Biopsy of Cancer,10305558,F99CA264398,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Axilla', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'DNA', 'DNA purification', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exclusion', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Institutes', 'Jordan', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Leukocytes', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measurement', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Oncogenic', 'Oncology', 'Oral', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'School Dentistry', 'Screening for cancer', 'Selection Bias', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer type', 'career', 'cell free DNA', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'ds-DNA', 'electric field', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'liquid biopsy', 'methylation pattern', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pre-doctoral', 'professor', 'saliva sample', 'skills', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F99,2021,42028
