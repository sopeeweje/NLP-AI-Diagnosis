"Gene Ontology Consortium PROJECT SUMMARY Because of the staggering complexity of biological systems, biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on knowledge stored in a computable form. The Gene Ontology (GO) is by far the largest knowledgebase of how genes function, and has become a critical component of the computational infrastructure enabling the genomic revolution. It has become nearly indispensible in the interpretation of large- scale molecular measurements in biological research. Crucially, for human health research, GO is also one of a suite of complementary ontologies constructed in such as way to maximally promote interoperability and comparability of data sets. It represents the gene functions and biological processes that are perturbed in human disease, e.g. via the links from Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) class abnormality of lipid metabolism, defined in relation to the GO class lipid metabolic process (GO_0006629), researchers or clinicians can find the set of genes that are known to be involved in this process. GO is a knowledge resource that can be statistically mined, either standalone or in combination with data from other knowledge resources, which enables experts to discover connections and form new hypotheses from the biological networks GO represents. All knowledge in GO is represented using semantic web technologies and so is amenable to computational integration and consistency checking. The proposed GO knowledge environment will enable a wider community of scientists to contribute to, and to utilize, a common, computable representation of biology. To ensure the knowledge environment meets the requirements of biomedical researchers, we will: a) deliver a comprehensive, detailed, computable knowledgebase of gene function, encoded in the Gene Ontology and annotations (computer-readable statements about the how specific genes function), focusing on human biology; b) provide a “hub” for a broad community of scientists to collaboratively extend, correct and improve the knowledgebase; c) ensure the GO knowledge resource is of the highest quality with regards to depth, breadth and accuracy; d) facilitate the transfer of insights obtained from studies of non-human organisms, such as the mouse and zebrafish, to human biology; and e) enable the scientific community to use the knowledgebase in analyses of large-scale genetic and -omics data. Our aims reflect the essential requirements for realizing the overarching objectives for a biomedical data resource: efficiently capturing and integrating biological knowledge and adhering to the highest possible standard for accuracy and detail; constructing and providing a robust, flexible, powerful, and extensible technological infrastructure available not only for internal use but just as easily by the wider community; and lastly, leveraging state-of-the-art social media, web services and other technologies to disseminate the GO resource to the entire biomedical research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This project aims to provide a complete and integrated picture of what every single gene in a human being does, thus allowing us to better understand the genetic and cellular workings of human health and disease. We do this by developing the Gene Ontology, a computational resource that collects biological knowledge into a large network structure that connects genes with the roles they play. Researchers, clinicians, and sophisticated computer programs use this network to interpret the massive amounts of biomedical and genomic data being generated in experiments and in studies designed to gain key insights into human health.",Gene Ontology Consortium,10130584,U41HG002273,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Gene Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Readability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Update', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer program', 'computing resources', 'data resource', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gene function', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'lipid metabolism', 'model organisms databases', 'molecular scale', 'ontology development', 'outreach', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'social media', 'software development', 'support network', 'text searching', 'tool', 'web services']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U41,2021,2283252
"The Monarch Initiative: Linking diseases to model organism resources ABSTRACT Biomedical researchers need to identify novel disease genes and understand disease mechanisms; clinicians need to diagnose diseases and optimize treatments. An improved understanding of the genetic basis of disease helps achieve both goals. The Monarch Initiative makes this possible by integrating the fragmented data landscape into the most comprehensive open collection of genotype-phenotype data in the world. Our Knowledge Graph (KG) links together clinical, biomedical, and basic science research data spanning multiple organisms, and supports reasoning across a wide range of organisms, body systems, and diseases. Monarch has achieved demonstrable clinical and translational success using model organism data to perform rare disease diagnosis and gene-to-disease discovery, and our resources have become global standards. In Phase II, we integrated the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) into the UMLS; enhanced our variant prioritization algorithms and Exomiser tool, which was applied to 30,000 patients in the National Health Service (UK); developed the Biolink Model/API; released new ontologies (Mondo unified disease ontology, Unified Phenotype Ontology (uPheno), and the Environmental Conditions and Treatments Ontology (ECTO)), raised the number of harmonized data sources in our KG to 34; and overhauled our web Portal. We will leverage this foundation to make Monarch more intuitive for a diversity of users and contexts in phase III as follows: Augment the Monarch Portal with new visualizations and tools. Guided by user requirements, iterative user testing, and feedback, we propose to enhance the user experience and Portal functionality, focusing our work on improvements to Navigation, Visualization, and Query. Evaluate, optimize, and enhance algorithms for disease diagnostics, cross-species inference, and gene-disease discovery. We will develop a comprehensive, modular evaluation framework, ‘PhEval,’ that will allow us to monitor the diagnostic yield and performance of cross-species inference as our ontologies and data graphs evolve. This will assist basic science researchers and clinicians to reveal cross-species mechanistic evidence and evaluate potential precision disease modeling strategies. Disseminate computational tools, data, services, and tutorials to a broad translational community. We will expand access to our KG to enable users to process the KG for different domains and use cases, through simplified downloads, APIs, software libraries, R packages, Jupyter notebooks, and Dockerized resources, along with training materials. This will better support bioinformaticians and other researchers in leveraging our KG and phenotype data in their analyses. The Monarch Initiative aims to significantly improve the utilization, accessibility, and value of animal models for disease diagnosis and discovery. NARRATIVE To understand disease mechanisms and develop effective treatments, we need to untangle the relationship between genetics and phenotypes of all organisms (such as human, mouse, zebrafish, and fruitfly). Sophisticated comparative information systems are needed to collect, search, and compare the diverse and often mutually incompatible data being generated. The Monarch Initiative has amassed the largest open collection of multi-species genotype-phenotype data in the world; here we propose to extend Monarch’s technology, data resources, and tools to use organismal data to advance precision medicine.",The Monarch Initiative: Linking diseases to model organism resources,10173498,R24OD011883,"['Algorithms', 'Aloral', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intuition', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'National Health Services', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'body system', 'clinical decision support', 'comparative', 'computable phenotypes', 'computerized tools', 'data access', 'data dissemination', 'data harmonization', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge graph', 'machine learning method', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'operation', 'outreach', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'web portal', 'web site']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R24,2021,1341553
"BioPortal: An Expansive Knowledgebase of Biomedical Entities and Relations ABSTRACT The most widely used and most general-purpose knowledgebases in biomedicine are the ontologies that define the entities and the relationships that are central to different aspects of health care or the life sciences. When ontologies are brought together in an integrated framework—enabling terms denoting the same or similar entities to be related to one another and allowing computational infrastructure to operate across ontologies—then the aggregate collection of ontologies provides additional capabilities for users. Our group has developed an enormously popular knowledge resource, known as BioPortal, that provides a unique knowledgebase of nearly all the world’s publicly accessible biomedical ontologies. Adoption of BioPortal has been remarkable. Each month, more than 75,000 unique users from academia, government, and industry access the contents of our ontology repository, and our API services more than 16 million requests. At least 7,850 scientific papers mention the use of BioPortal, according to Google Scholar. We propose the following four specific aims: (1) We will continue to govern and maintain the BioPortal knowledgebase by enhancing the services that the knowledgebase provides to the biomedical community. (2) We will improve the efficiency with which users interact with the knowledgebase by creating the BioPortal Knowledge Graph. The graph—which will be a queryable knowledge resource in its own right—will integrate all ontologies in the knowledgebase and it will provide links to other knowledge sources, allowing users to perform expanded queries across all ontologies. (3) We will enable users of BioPortal to make requests for changes or extensions to ontologies, and to view the history of changes and change requests when ontologies are managed in Git repositories. The result will be a much more efficient workflow for making suggestions to ontology developers and the ability to monitor the change history of component ontologies to inform ontology selection for particular end-user tasks. (4) We will provide enhanced mechanisms to enable users of BioPortal to search, access, and browse knowledge in remote BioPortal servers. Users no longer will need to know in advance where particular knowledge might be stored and they will have the ability to easily integrate knowledge from complementary scientific disciplines stored across a network of servers. The result will be the world’s most widely accessed knowledgebase of biomedical concepts and relationships— supporting all other work in semantic technology in biomedicine and making all biomedical knowledgebases more standardized, more easily integrated, and more FAIR. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical scientists use descriptions of biomedical concepts (and of the relationships among concepts) known as ontologies to standardize how researchers and clinicians talk about biomedical phenomena. There are hundreds of such ontologies covering different areas of biomedicine, and finding, accessing, and putting ontologies to use can be extremely challenging. BioPortal provides a knowledgebase that integrates more than 800 biomedical ontologies, making it easy for scientists and clinicians to use the resulting knowledge to describe their data, to access information more reliably, to build other knowledge resources in standardized ways, and to bring biomedical knowledge both to the laboratory and to the point of care.",BioPortal: An Expansive Knowledgebase of Biomedical Entities and Relations,10271048,U24GM143402,"['Academia', 'Access to Information', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Biological Sciences', 'Businesses', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Ecology', 'Ensure', 'Government', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Industry', 'Information Management', 'Information Resources', 'Information Resources Management', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Paper', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'computer infrastructure', 'data integration', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge integration', 'knowledge of results', 'natural language', 'phrases', 'point of care', 'programs', 'repository', 'systems research', 'web server', 'web services']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,1083026
