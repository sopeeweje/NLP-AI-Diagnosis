"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,10167757,U24HG003345,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ensure', 'Equus caballus', 'Family', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Glutathione S-Transferase', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pan Genus', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudogenes', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Study models', 'Syntenic Conservation', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'Zebrafish', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'gene product', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'interest', 'member', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'olfactory receptor', 'parallelization', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vertebrate genome', 'web site']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2021,498829
"Dfam: sustainable growth, curation support, and improved quality for mobile element annotation Project Summary / Abstract Repetitive DNA, especially that due to transposable elements (TEs), makes up a large fraction of many genomes. Thorough and accurate annotation of repetitive content in genomes depends on a comprehensive database of known TEs, along with robust statistical and procedural methods for recognizing decayed instances of elements and disentangling their complex relationships.  Annotation of TE instances is usually performed using our RepeatMasker software, which compares a genome to a database containing representations of known repeat families. These have historically been consensus sequences, which generally approximate the sequences of the original TEs. The largest repository of such consensus sequences is Repbase, whose restrictive license and limited interface for curators has led to a lack of input from third parties and the creation of many unaffiliated, often organism-specific open databases. The parallel existence of these many databases has led to a divergence in nomenclature and repeat definition.  Our Dfam database is an open access collection of repetitive DNA families, in which each family is represented by a multiple sequence alignment and a profile hidden Markov model (HMM). We have demonstrated that profile HMMs support improved annotation sensitivity, and Dfam provides numerous aids to both curators of TE families and those who make use of the resulting annotations. In this proposal, we describe a plan to develop the infrastructure of Dfam to expand to 1000s of genomes, and to establish a self-sustaining TE Data Commons dependent on limited centralized curation. We further describe plans to improve the quality of repeat annotation through development of methods for more reliable alignment adjudication, to expand approaches to visualization of this complex data type, and to improve the modeling of TE subfamilies.  By further developing this open access database, we will provide a strong disincentive for the proliferation of unaffiliated non-standard repeat datasets and ease the burden of data management for those developing TE libraries. Project Narrative Most of the vertebrate genome finds its ultimate origin in transposable elements (TEs), and the thorough annotation of TEs is a critical aspect of genome annotation pipelines. Currently, the data used for this annotation is dominated by a single database, Repbase, whose restrictive license impedes coalescence on a central standardized resource. We have developed an innovative open access database (Dfam) that yields substantial gains in TE annotation quality and provides numerous novel features in support of community TE curation. We will grow and improve Dfam to create a sustainable, standardized, and open system for TE family data. To achieve this, we will develop Dfam's infrastructure to scale to 1000s of genomes, develop improved methods for computing and representing the complex relationships between TE instances, and develop a framework for aiding curators in developing and sharing their TE libraries.","Dfam: sustainable growth, curation support, and improved quality for mobile element annotation",10165778,U24HG010136,"['Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Biological databases', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Commons', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disincentive', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Evolution', 'FAIR principles', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'complex data', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'expectation', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'meetings', 'method development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'reference genome', 'repository', 'sustainability framework', 'vertebrate genome', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,U24,2021,626468
"Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic PROJECT SUMMARY We are in the midst of a genomic revolution; more than 250,000 human genomes have been sequenced, generating over a petabase of genomic data. While these new data hold great promise to impact health, there is a disconnect between genomic discovery and clinical care. Providers frequently misinterpret genomic information, patients often don't understand their own test results, and genomic information about disease risk is infrequently shared between patients and family members. Importantly, ineffective communication and data misinterpretation has devastating consequences- including unnecessary organ removal, missed disease prevention opportunities, and premature death. We are addressing these genomic care gaps by developing and testing tools that optimize the integration of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (WES, WGS) for general clinical practice. My vision for improving genomic medicine is based on my work within multidisciplinary consortia and addresses the National Human Genome Research Institute's priority research area of improving the effectiveness of healthcare. In the proposed work we will test the effectiveness of a multilevel genomic e-Health intervention in cancer (Aim 1). Our intervention 1) educates physicians and patients about genomics, 2) enables direct-to-patient return-of- results, 3) provides physicians with patient-specific results and resources for interpretation, and 4) facilitates sharing of genomic results within families. We hypothesize that intervention use will result in higher rates of uptake of high-quality, genetically guided care. We will test our hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial among academic and community physicians who use WES for their patients. Next, we will use an iterative process, with stakeholder engagement, to adapt and pilot test our tool for Spanish and Mandarin speaking patients and for patients who have diabetes (Aim 2). Finally, we will create and assess new, moderated, social networks as a platform for genomic information sharing (Aim 3). Our hypothesis is that providers, patients and family members will engage with the genomic information sharing social networks and find them to be highly useful. Our general approach includes 1) creating the secure social networks, 2) integrating the networks into our e-Health intervention, and 3) using complementary methods, such as interviews and natural language processing, to assess stakeholders' network-related attitudes and network information quality. If successful, we will be well positioned to widely disseminate our e-Health tools. In sum, this work stands to transform how people obtain, process and share genomic information in the context of clinical care. Our tools reconceive genetic communication to allow for multi-directional flow of information, connects multiple stakeholders with one another, and integrates high-quality dynamic web-based resources to improve genomic care. In creating and deploying tools that both respond to and leverage the complexities of our information environment, we intend to transform genomic research and clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE/ RELEVANCE OF PROJECT TO RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH Widespread utilization of genomic sequencing in medicine creates an urgent need to educate providers and patients. Currently, providers frequently misinterpret genomic information and patients often don't understand their own test results. In order to address this critical need, we propose to design and test multiple e-Health communication tools that will help providers and patients to better understand genomic data, lead to higher quality patient care, and facilitate genomic information sharing within families.",Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic,10204071,R35HG010721,"['Address', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Community Physician', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human Genome', 'Information Networks', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Secure', 'Social Network', 'Sum', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'eHealth', 'effectiveness testing', 'exome', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'online resource', 'premature', 'tool', 'uptake', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,R35,2021,527496
"Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families PROJECT ABSTRACT  To advance the health and care of children, as in eMERGE II & III, CCHMC will assemble a birth cohort in eMERGE IV, ascertained on pregnant or recently delivered self-identified African-American (AA) women and their babies, along with the willing fathers and siblings. The eMERGE IV collection will be the inaugural effort in a new CCHMC initiative, a birth cohort of mother and baby dyads called My Genome and Me, Cincinnati (MGMC), conceived to develop an understanding of the genomics that informs health and disease risk, beginning at birth and continuing across the lifespan with dyads randomized at enrollment to genotyping with return of results as neonates or later as older children. Our eMERGE IV project will directly grapple with the ethical issues raised by return of results to families with different considerations operating in babies, siblings and parents regarding the particular phenotypes being studied. For eMERGE IV, as site-specific phenotypes, we nominate Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer. We will exploit the work done that will enable developing polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and genomic risk estimates (GREs) for these conditions in addition to the 15 others chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and anticipate developing consensus across the Network for the PRSs and GREs applied. The care of families will exploit the harmonization of the electronic health records between the adult and pediatric hospitals, which has been achieved with the Maternal and Infant Data Hub (MIDH) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. For data quality control we will evaluate discrepancies between eMERGE IV genotyping and low read depth coverage (LRDC) genotypes (LRDC sequencing will be at CCHMC expense.) We will collect preferences and attitudes of our local AA community with respect to genomic results and return of results. We will develop health risk-reducing recommendations and return GREs with and without actionable PRSs to assess the influence of PRSs on the adherence to risk-mitigating recommendations. We will use SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) through the electronic health record (EHR)-integrated clinical decision support (CDS)-Hooks framework to provide CDS to both the adult and pediatric EHR systems. We will periodically revise PRSs and GREs and return changes when indicated. CCHMC will provide LRDC sequencing from >17,000 DNA AA samples from children in the CCHMC biobank and ≥50,000 subjects in total for genotype generation and mitochondrial DNA variant analysis. Federated geocoding will be available to all eMERGE IV sites from CCHMC. To disseminate genomic practice within CCHMC, across the Network, and in general, CCHMC will provide services to advance PRSs and GREs for specific conditions, starting with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, migraine headache, and suicide. In sum, CCHMC presents an aggressive program use genomic medicine to advance toward better health outcomes focused on underserved AA dyads of neonates and mothers with their families. Project Narrative Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) proposes to join eMERGE IV by enrolling of local Cincinnati African-American newborn babies and their mothers with available fathers and brothers and sisters to develop predictions of their risk for Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer (along with 15 disorders chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and disorders chosen by CCHMC Faculty) using genetic variation, environmental factors, and family history. We will test whether knowledge of having a higher genetic risk for these disorders will motivate closer adherence to health recommendations made to reduce disease risk.",Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families,10207723,U01HG011172,"['7 year old', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent Psychiatry', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Ancillary Study', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Attitude', 'Birth', 'Brothers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Repository', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethical Issues', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Fathers', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fetus', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mothers', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Siblings', 'Sister', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Sum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biobank', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data hub', 'data modeling', 'data quality', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'minority subjects', 'neonate', 'polygenic risk score', 'preference', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'programs', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHGRI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,U01,2021,1669753
"Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections Thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections (TAAD) are a cause of premature deaths, responsible for up to 8% of sudden deaths in industrialized countries. Identifying individuals at risk for TAAD allows for medical management that prevents deaths due to dissections. We determined that up to 20% of TAAD patients without a known genetic syndrome have a family history of TAAD, which is inherited primarily in an autosomal dominant manner (termed heritable thoracic aortic disease, HTAD). We established a cohort of HTAD families (842 families with two or more members with TAAD) and used this cohort to identify novel HTAD genes. Positional cloning and candidate gene approaches by our lab and others have successfully identified 18 genes for HTAD. We hypothesize that there are multiple altered genes yet to be identified, disrupting known and novel molecular pathways responsible for thoracic aortic disease, and responsible for disease in the unsolved HTAD families. The overarching goal of the project is to identify the remaining genes for HTAD, characterize the phenotype associated with these novel genes, perform initial molecular studies linking the mutant gene to aortic disease, and rapidly translate these findings into improved clinical care and prevention of premature deaths due to aortic dissection in HTAD families. The proposed aims are: (1) Recruit and characterize additional HTAD families to be used to identify novel genes, and delineate the clinical features and mutation spectrum associated with new genes; (2) Pursue exome/genome sequencing on HTAD cases and use the genetic strategies to identify novel genes, including segregation of rare variants in affected relatives and trios (affected proband and unaffected parents) and burden analyses; (3) Pursue a machine-learning approach using exome data from HTAD families and controls to identify novel disease genes; (4) Perform initial molecular and cellular biology studies of novel HTAD genes to confirm a link between the mutant gene and thoracic aortic disease. In summary, we are uniquely poised to identify novel HTAD genes using our assembled cohort and are proposing both proven and novel strategies to identify additional HTAD genes. Uncovering HTAD genes is crucial for identifying individuals at risk for aortic dissections and initiating gene-specific clinical management to prevent premature death due to dissections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute aortic dissections are a common cause of premature death in the United States. The goal of the proposed research is to prevent premature deaths due to dissections by identifying individuals who are predisposed by uncovering all the genetic variants in the human genome that trigger dissection.",Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections,10207736,R01HL109942,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Survival', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dissection', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FBN1', 'FOXE3 gene', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'LOX gene', 'LTBP2 gene', 'Link', 'MADH4 gene', 'MYH11 gene', 'MYLK gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Medical', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Sudden Death', 'Surgical Management', 'Syndrome', 'TGFB2 gene', 'TGFBR1 gene', 'TGFBR2 gene', 'Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'family management', 'gene discovery', 'genetic approach', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'positional cloning', 'premature', 'prevent', 'proband', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'segregation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,640858
"Data-driven Computational Modeling and Refinement of Protein Structures on Genomic Scales PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: A key remaining gap in our understanding of biological systems at the molecular level is how to structurally annotate the “dark” protein families—the portion of protein families unsolved by experimental structure determination techniques and inaccessible to homology modeling. Nearly a quarter of protein families are currently dark, where molecular conformation is completely unknown and this gap is likely to expand further with the rapid accumulation of new protein sequences without annotated structures. The key challenge is now how to bridge this gap to gain a comprehensive understanding of biology and disease, thereby paving the way to structure-based drug design at genomic scale. Computational protein modeling plays a key role in this effort due to its scalability and genome-wide applicability. My laboratory focuses on the development and application of novel data-driven computational modeling and refinement methods to increase accuracy and coverage of protein structure prediction on genomic scale irrespective of homology. Future research focuses on improving homology-free protein folding using multiscale de novo modeling driven by deep learning-based inter-residue interactions, enhancing low-homology threading or fold recognition by formulating new algorithms for remote template identification despite low evolutionary relatedness, and developing methods for high-resolution restrained structure refinement guided by generalized ensemble search for driving computational models to near-experimental accuracy. Proteome-wide computational modeling and refinement effort will be conducted, leveraging our unique access to large-scale supercomputing infrastructure, to build high-confidence models covering the dark protein families, which will be organized in a database for public access. This comprehensive database of structural annotations will shed light on the structures, functions, and interactions of the dark proteome, with broad implications in drug discovery and human health. Software and web servers will be freely disseminated to help worldwide community of biomedical researchers to apply these methods to their specific research problems, thus multiplying the impact of computational modeling on basic research in biology and medicine. My research program will involve close collaborations with other NIGMS-supported investigators, create training opportunities for the next generation of researchers including members from underrepresented groups, and foster future research advances in structural bioinformatics and computational biology. PROJECT NARRATIVE: A comprehensive atomic-level annotation of protein structures is essential for understanding the molecular basis of complex diseases and facilitating structure-based drug design. Lack of structural annotation of a major fraction protein universe, the so-called dark families, is a key gap in our understanding of molecular biology and diseases. This research bridges the gap by developing and applying data-driven computational modeling and refinement methods on genomic scale to predict high-quality structures covering the dark proteome, thus accelerating drug discovery leading to improved human health.",Data-driven Computational Modeling and Refinement of Protein Structures on Genomic Scales,10261487,R35GM138146,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Disease', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Play', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'Techniques', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'base', 'biological systems', 'database structure', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'member', 'next generation', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'training opportunity', 'web server']",NIGMS,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,R35,2021,373529
"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point. Our collaborative databases, multivariate analyses and innovative antibody optimization strategies will establish platforms for discovery and delivery of much-needed treatments against these and other infectious diseases.",Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats,10158446,U19AI142790,"['Address', 'Alphavirus', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Arenavirus', 'Arthritogenic', 'Biological Assay', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Disease', 'Ebola', 'Ebola virus', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Filovirus', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Lassa virus', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Monoclonal Antibody Therapy', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primate Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'biodefense', 'chikungunya', 'clinical development', 'design', 'emerging pathogen', 'experience', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mosquito-borne', 'multidisciplinary', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'research study', 'structural biology', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,U19,2021,7065330
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives. The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program plans to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG. The KMC long-term objective is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins.",Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome,10073482,U24CA224370,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alleles', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'FAIR principles', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome Components', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources Management', 'International', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Portal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Non-Human Protein', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Reagent', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'TRD@ gene cluster', 'Translational Research', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'computer science', 'data ecosystem', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease classification', 'experience', 'gender difference', 'genome resource', 'health data', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge graph', 'member', 'novel', 'online community', 'outreach', 'programs', 'public repository', 'repository', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool', 'web site']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,U24,2021,1037175
