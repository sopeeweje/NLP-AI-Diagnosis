"Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic PROJECT SUMMARY Up-to-date information about non-fatal overdose emergency department (ED) encounters can provide critical information about the evolution of the opioid epidemic and response of the healthcare system and is an essential to planning of clinical trials to address the problems underlying this epidemic. Establishing a platform that delivers high positive predictive value for opioid-related overdose (OD) using a combination of coded and natural language terms in electronic health records (EHRs) is an essential step toward the large-scale surveillance necessary to evaluate the pragmatic effectiveness of numerous systemic and policy-based efforts and to create the infrastructure for large scale trials to reduce drug-related mortality and morbidity. However, to date, localized and federal efforts have been largely based on discrete ICD-10 code data or have had time lags of one-to-three years for more detailed data. Perhaps more Importantly, they have not had the capacity for planning and feasibility assessment for clinical and translational research at specific sites. We propose foundational work to create an inter-institutional research database and network focused on patients presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD. To create this network, we will extend previous work to develop: (1) an e-phenotype for case identification in the ED based on EHR data, and (2) combine this with a data dictionary and coded data extraction tools, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, to obtain additional data from EHRs; tools for primary capture of data during clinical care; and tools for integration of data on social determinants of health. This will allow for a more thorough characterization of individuals presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD including: demographics, comorbidities, OD agent and source, intentionality of the OD, ED treatment and discharge disposition. Through refinement and automation, the data extraction process will be extended to a set of pilot CTSA Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) Network sites and then potentially to other CTSA's nation-wide. This new functionality focuses on providing a platform to accelerate research. To accomplish this work, our Specific Aims are to: 1) Demonstrate the feasibility of extending the ACT Network data model and infrastructure to monitor the opioid epidemic using ED data, 2) Create a prototype opioid overdose monitoring and response network across participating institutions and a toolkit for other CTSA sites to join the network, and 3) Demonstrate potential usefulness of the network in monitoring the opioid epidemic and in planning clinical trials. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective near real time means of monitoring opioid-related OD presentation in EDs across the country to inform point-of-care service delivery, prevention and treatment intervention development and evaluation. Downstream, the application of project deliverables include dissemination of the replication toolkit to leverage the platform of the CTSAs and NIDA Clinical Trials Network to build capacity for timely surveillance of opioid-related OD to facilitate prevention and treatment research and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients presenting with opioid-related overdose to hospital emergency departments represent a high-risk group for morbidity and mortality and a potential target for interventions to combat the opioid epidemic. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective inter-institutional research database and network focused on these patients. These tools will inform point-of-care service delivery, as well as enhance nationwide prevention and treatment interventions.",Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic,10198067,U01TR002628,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'California', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fentanyl', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Resources', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heroin', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investments', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratories', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Prescription Drugs', 'Odds Ratio', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome Study', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Research', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Site', 'Source', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical infrastructure', 'combat', 'comorbidity', 'data dictionary', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data tools', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electronic data', 'fitness', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose prevention', 'point of care', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prototype', 'response', 'service delivery', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'synthetic opioid', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational study', 'treatment research']",NCATS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,U01,2021,724111
"STIMuLINK Project Abstract STIMuLINK will address Objective 2 of RFA-CE-21-002 by identifying risk/protective factors for stimulant-involved deaths that are actionable for the development or adaptation of current prevention and intervention efforts. For the period 2017-2024, STIMuLINK will link records from stimulant-involved fatal overdoses found in Kentucky’s drug overdose fatality surveillance system (DOFSS) to electronic medical records (EMR) available from the state’s largest primary and safety net healthcare system, UK Healthcare (UKHC). This innovative data linkage reduces the surveillance bias associated with medical information obtained only from coroner reports, makes EMR “gold standard” medical information available for research, improves data completeness needed for risk/protective factor ascertainment using the concept of “computable phenotypes”, and enables a comparative cohort of patients found in the EMR (i.e, those with evidence of harmful stimulant use). Using traditional and novel (the Feasible Solution Algorithm) statistical approaches to analyze these cohorts, STIMuLINK will examine risk/protective factors predictive of fatal stimulant overdoses using the social ecological model as the principal framework. In parallel with these Aims, STIMuLINK tests the use of existing biomedical natural language processing (NLP) tools to extract additional factors from the “literal text” notes found in DOFSS (added back as structured variables to the risk/protective models when possible) and compares findings from notes written by coroners to notes written by medical examiners in a neighboring state. The guidance and open-source software developed from this Aim will advance the science of NLP for automating the workflow for injury surveillance. STIMuLINK’s diverse, multidisciplinary and accomplished team includes epidemiologists, computer scientists, lawyers, statisticians, and behavioral scientists with experience working directly with communities impacted by the current polydrug overdose epidemic. The project specifically includes on-going communication points with vulnerable communities and clinical populations to increase the translational impact of the research. Project Narrative STIMuLINK provides insight on the risk and protective factors predictive of stimulant-involved deaths by unlocking the information available in the electronic medical records from prior healthcare visits and the literal text written by coroners during an overdose investigation.",STIMuLINK,10391677,R01CE003360,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2021,362500
"Computational prediction of gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism Project Summary / Abstract Notwithstanding pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials performed to identify efficacy, side effects, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), only 25-60% of patients respond favorably to prescribed drugs, leading to a cost of $30-$130 billion in the US annually. ADRs are partially attributed to the gut microbiome, i.e. the complex and dynamic community of microorganisms residing in gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiome interacts with different types of xenobiotics including drugs, resulting in biotransformation of therapeutics into metabolites with altered disposition, efficacy, and toxicity. Gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism leads to non-effective treatments as well as teratogenic, toxic, and lethal effects that in some cases were not recognized until the drug was on the market. As a result, leading pharmaceutical researchers have begun to recognize that the role of gut microbiome in drug metabolism should be accounted for in attempts to improve treatment effectiveness. However, despite extensive progress in gut microbiome research, there is currently no reliable, cost-effective approach to integrate gut-mediated drug metabolism in drug development pipelines. This Phase I proposal aims to address this challenge by developing a new computational platform with the ability to predict microbial metabolism of therapeutic drugs and to leverage that information to enhance drug design and development. We will employ a range of state-of-the-art computational biology techniques to reliably screen for microorganisms that may metabolize the target drugs. The novelty of this project lies in the ability to screen drug-metabolizing enzymes/microorganisms using multiple metrics and methods to increase the reliability of predictions to achieve the accuracy necessary for clinical and commercial use. This multi- method platform will be built, integrated, and validated in an iterative fashion using targeted in vitro experiments on two candidate drugs, i.e. the anti-arrhythmic drug amiodarone and the anti-viral drug famciclovir. This project is designed to both advance our current understanding of microbiome function in the context of drug-gut interactions as well as inform strategies to help enhance public health and economic growth. The value proposition of this project includes leveraging publicly available bioinformatics databases as well as advances in computational biology techniques to develop a more precise, reliable, and inexpensive tool for gut microbiome-mediated metabolism of therapeutic drugs. This in-silico platform could be employed for both current drugs as well as drugs under development. For current drugs, this platform can help increase the safety of drugs by predicting the mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity as they may differ from individual-to- individual. For new drugs, the platform would reduce the cost and timeframe of drug development, while increasing the effectiveness of the therapeutics themselves. Project Narrative Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) place significant clinical and economic burden on patients, their care-givers, and healthcare systems.

"A Machine Learning-Based Mobile Application and Cloud Platform to Enable Accurate and Streamlined Surveillance of Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection and Schistosomiasis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections and schistosomiasis affect 2 billion people and have significant detrimental effects on health. Strategies to implement STH and schistosomiasis interventions currently rely on testing for these parasites by microscopic analysis of stool samples to detect parasite eggs and identify egg species. Accurate surveillance testing and timely and accurate reporting of results are required for effective decision-making at the programmatic level to implement infection control strategies. Approaches that increase the speed and standardize the accuracy of microscopy-based testing and streamline reporting could help eliminate STH infections and schistosomiasis. We propose to develop a mobile phone-based STH-schistosome egg identification and counting tool that employs machine learning (deep learning) and works in the absence of an internet connection. With this app, users will collect surveillance data for integration into a cloud platform. Surveillance data can then be visualized in dashboards to inform interventions to control disease. Our approach is fundamentally different from other published work that develop machine learning algorithms for STH and schistosomiasis because it will very accurately identify egg types during surveillance activities, and it will be available to users in an app and integrate with cloud storage and reporting. Our interdisciplinary team combines the expertise of global health researchers, product usability testing experts, microscopists, and data scientists. In the R21 phase, we will collect the largest ever microscopy image set of STH and schistosome eggs (> 15 000). We will train an algorithm based on convolutional neural networks that make highly accurate parasite egg classification (species identification) and embed this algorithm into a mobile app that works without internet connectivity. To promote app utility, we will evaluate its accuracy and usability in a surveillance setting. We established the feasibility of our approach in preliminary data by building a web app that serves the results of a deep learning model that identifies STH and schistosome eggs with > 98% accuracy. The R33 phase will be only undertaken if well-defined milestones are achieved. We will further develop the mobile app as a data capture system that will integrate with cloud storage and a dynamic data visualization system to enable increased accuracy in STH and schistosomiasis surveillance over time and across geographic location. ​Validation studies will assess the​ benefits of the system to time and cost savings and quality of data collected during surveillance activities. The overall goal of this work is to increase the accuracy and streamline STH and schistosomiasis surveillance to enable effective decision-making in disease control. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate surveillance testing in the field and timely and accurate reporting of results are required for effective decision-making by soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection and schistosomiasis control and prevention programs. This project will develop and test a mobile phone-based STH-schistosomiasis diagnostic system that employs machine learning to very accurately identify and count parasite eggs from microscopy images of stool samples.

"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images African American and Latinx communities nationally and in California not only bear a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths but are also not taking part in COVID-19 testing for a wide range of understudied reasons. This can have profound implications in safety net health care settings where vulnerable patients, who are in need of clinical procedures to prevent significant morbidity, are refusing such potentially lifesaving procedures because of fear of COVID-19 testing and/or contracting COVID-19. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) is the second largest publicly operated county safety net health care system in the United States, serving more than 750,000 patients annually. Timely access to health care in this under-resourced, high-need setting has been an ongoing challenge for its majority Latinx and African American patients. With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why patients refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. To this end, we propose to explore the obstacles to COVID-19 pre- procedural testing and provide COVID-19 specific training to LACDHS Community Health Workers (CHWs) from these same communities to effectively address: a) the primary goal of increasing COVID-19 testing for individual patients, and the secondary goals of b) facilitating needed procedural care in a timely manner for the safety net health system, and c) developing a sustained public health presence in these communities to build trust and preparedness for critical COVID-19 related future needs. Trained CHWs can help to more effectively overcome obstacles to COVID-19 testing, including historical barriers of mistrust, provide COVID-19 health education, help address social determinants of health and help facilitate technological literacy to improve patient access to testing and care in a telehealth environment. The proposal uses a multidisciplinary, mixed- methods approach including unsupervised machine learning and qualitative interviews to systematically explore barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing among vulnerable safety net patients. We will then train clinically based, ethnically/linguistically matched CHWs to implement a hypothesis-driven intervention consisting of six group classes and six personalized patient encounters with African American and Latinx safety net patients. This study has the following specific aims: Aim 1- Utilize machine learning methods to assess whether there are characteristics that define African American and Latinx safety-net patients who engage in or refuse COVID-19 testing; Aim 2 - Conduct in-depth interviews with African American and Latinx patients who either declined or accepted COVID testing to explore contextual, behavioral, and attitudinal factors shaping patient circumstances and concerns; Aim 3 - Develop, implement, and pre-test a CHW intervention with the information from Aims 1 and 2, utilizing a randomized control design among African American and Latinx safety net patients to assess the effect of the CHW hypothesis-driven intervention on trust, self-efficacy, and intent to participate in COVID-19 testing. Project Narrative With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why vulnerable patients in safety net health care settings refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. This grant is an innovative proposal that seeks to (1) bring together machine learning and behavioral methods to understand the reasons why Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) safety net patients who require COVID-19 testing for procedures refuse or accept COVID-19 testing, and (2) utilize the knowledge gleaned to implement a Community Health Worker (CHW)-based intervention, using LACDHS CHWs, that addresses the multilevel obstacles to COVID- 19 testing. Insights gained from this research may be of benefit to improve COVID-19 uptake in other similar safety net settings with CHWs and in planning the future uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in such medically underserved settings.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,10258973,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Behavioral', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 testing', 'COVID-19 vaccine', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Health Services', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health education', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Housing', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latinx', 'Linguistics', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'PhenX Toolkit', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Religion', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transportation', 'Trust', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccines', 'Weighing patient', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'economic need', 'health care availability', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'literacy', 'machine learning method', 'medically underserved', 'multidisciplinary', 'outreach', 'pandemic disease', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'retinal imaging', 'safety net', 'skills', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'telehealth', 'testing access', 'testing uptake', 'unsupervised learning', 'uptake', 'vaccine acceptance', 'virtual intervention', 'virtual patient']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis Project Summary Clinical trials are foundational to evidence-based medicine, but results reporting from trials is incomplete and frequently delayed. It is estimated that as many as half of clinical trials are not published and as many as half of published trials underreport or misreport outcomes. This type of results reporting distorts the evidence available to clinicians—particularly when it comes to assessing the safety of interventions like drugs and devices—and may place patients at unnecessary risk. There is a critical need for novel methods to identify and monitor drug safety data. Through the infrastructure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov, structured trial results (including safety findings) are now becoming available for an increasing number of trials in a comprehensive and timely fashion. However, access and use of these data in evidence synthesis tasks remain limited. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest single registry for clinical studies worldwide and includes more than 260,000 registered studies. Of the 108,941 completed trials registered with the site, 20% have uploaded results data for a total of 7.85 million participants. Results data reported on ClinicalTrials.gov have the potential to fill gaps created by delays and biases in published articles and provide an earlier and more complete overview of available trial evidence. We propose to develop novel informatics approaches based on combinations of information retrieval and machine learning methods to facilitate access and analysis of trial results reported in this registry. Focusing on trials testing drug interventions in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and oncology, we perform this work in three specific aims: 1) Develop semi-automated trial screening for identifying and aggregating trials relevant to a clinical intervention; 2) Extract adverse event and safety outcomes data from results reported in the registry; and 3) Perform validation studies to assess detection of adverse events and performance of semi- automated meta-analyses of safety outcomes. Methods developed in this project will facilitate timely, broad- scale use of trial results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data. All methods will be made publicly available in order to support adverse event monitoring and systematic reviews of drug interventions. Project Narrative The availability of results from clinical trials is frequently incomplete or delayed, limiting the evidence available to clinicians making treatment decisions. When results on the safety of interventions, such as drugs, are not properly disseminated, patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timely reporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov), representing a novel data type that could be used for drug safety surveillance. However, the use of these data has remained limited to date. We propose innovative informatics methods to enable access and analysis of this emerging data source in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data.",Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis,10136717,R01LM012976,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Bibliographic Databases', 'Bibliography', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug usage', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse event monitoring', 'base', 'cluster trial', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'drug testing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medication safety', 'novel', 'rosiglitazone', 'safety outcomes', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'trial design', 'validation studies', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,328000
"Collaborative Research: Statistical algorithms for anomaly detection and patterns recognition in patient care and safety event reports Medical errors have been shown to be the third leading cause of death in the United States. The Institute of Medicine and several state legislatures have recommended the use of patient safety event reporting systems (PSRS) to better understand and improve safety hazards. Numerous healthcare providers have adopted these systems, which provide a framework for healthcare provlder staff to report patient safety events. Public databases like MAUDE and VAERS have also been created to collect and trend safety events across healthcare systems. A patient safety event (PSE) report generally consists of both structured and unstructured data elements. Structured data are pre-defined, fixed fields that solicit specific information about the event. The unstructured data fields generally include a free text field where the reporter can enter a text description of the event. The text descriptions are often a rich data source in that the reporter ls not constrained to limited categories or selection options and is able to freely descrlbe the details of the event. The goal of this project is to develop novel statistical methods to analyze unstructured text like patient safety event reports arising in healthcare, which can lead to significant improvements to patient safety and enable timely intervention strategies. We address three problems: (a) Building realistic and meaningful baseline models for near misses, and detecting systematic deterioration of adverse outcomes relative to such baselines; (b) Understanding critical factors that lead to near misses & quantifying severity of outcomes; and (c) ldentifylng document groups of interest. We will use novel statistical approaches that combine Natural Language Processing with Statistical Process Monitoring, Statistical Networks Analysis, and Spatio-temporal Modeling to build a generalizable toolbox that can address these issues in healthcare. An important advantage of our research team is the involvement of healthcare domain experts and access to frontline staff, and we will leverage this strength to develop our algorithms. A key feature of our work is the generalizability of our methods, which will be applicable to biomedical documents arising across a remarkable variety of areas, such as patient safety and equipment malfunction reports, electronic health records, adverse drug or vaccine reports, etc. We will also release open source software via R packages & GitHub, which will enable healthcare staff and researchers to execute our methods on their datasets. Estimates of preventable adverse events in healthcare are staggering, despite the frequently cited Institute of Medicine (IOM) report that first brought attention to the problem over ten years ago. Identifying temporal trends and patterns in the data is particularly important to improving patient safety and patient care. Using our algorithms to effectively analyze documents from reporting systems has the potential to dramatically improve the safety and quality of care by exposing possible weaknesses in the care process.",Collaborative Research: Statistical algorithms for anomaly detection and patterns recognition in patient care and safety event reports,10242965,R01LM013309,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment Malfunction', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interest Group', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Report (document)', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'hazard', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'spatiotemporal', 'structured data', 'trend', 'unstructured data']",NLM,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2021,264538
"Primed to (re)act: Can changes in procedural language prevent adverse events between police and minority male youth? PROJECT SUMMARY While researchers continue to study the effects of disproportionate minority contact with law enforcement on a range of health-related outcomes, a recent review of this work questions the methodological validity of most studies on this topic. Many of these concerns focus on (a) unrealistic assumptions about police behavior and (b) poor quality data. This project addresses both by introducing a human development based model of law enforcement officer (LEO) behavior and applying this model to study how LEOs identify with male minority youth (MMY) using a novel publicly available data source: broadcast police communications (BPC). Our long-term goals are (1) to assess the viability of BPC for understanding how LEOs perceive MMY both “in the moment” via the pre-reflective procedural language used before and during LEO-MMY encounters and “at rest” via development of a survey instrument measuring LEO identification with minority youth, and (2) to determine if BPC may be used in lieu of non-public data sources to study police behavior by developing a novel computational strategy for extracting meaningful information from BPC via, among other strategies, a first-of-its-kind automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and large scale (>100 hours) training corpus of transcribed BPC for use by computational social scientists and ASR researchers. Our previous research revealed that a complex set of psychosocial mechanisms govern the developmental trajectories of MMYs, indicating MMYs adopt reactive coping strategies to particular stressful events (e.g. encounters with police) that can be maladaptive (e.g. hypermasculinity) depending on context of interactions. Our work also suggests that all humans are subject to similar processes. Since the outcomes of LEO-MMY encounters are ultimately the responsibility of LEOs, this project seeks to improve the quality of these encounters (i.e. reduce youth trauma) by studying a little acknowledged LEO reactive coping strategy: the character of procedural language used to provide LEOs with incident-specific information via BPC. This conceptual approach derives from our theoretical framing (i.e. Spencer’s phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory, or PVEST) that highlights the development and utilization of reactive coping strategies in response—particularly—to MMY associated stress. It is our premise that BPC can prime LEOs to inaccurately interpret the behavior of MMY as threatening, increasing the potential for adverse events. Such inaccurate assessments are hard to combat since LEOs are acting on the best information available. As a result, the procedural language of BPC pose unacknowledged risks to the well- being of MMY. This study will thus perform a first-of-its-kind analysis of BPC to simultaneously assess its viability for determining racial discrimination in policing and develop a novel survey instrument measuring LEOs ability to identify with MMY for use by researchers and policing organizations across the country. Public Health Relevance / Project Narrative Across the United States, adverse events involving law enforcement officers (LEOs) and male minority youth (MMY) and the toxic stress associated with repeated negative LEO-MMY encounters raise compelling public health concerns about racial discrimination in policing. The proposed research addresses these concerns by (a) introducing a novel human development paradigm for the study of police behavior that focuses on how and to what extent LEOs identify with MMY and (b) assessing the technological viability of using broadcast police communications (BPC) for large scale analysis of police behavior, where BPC are analyzed as pre-reflective accounts of LEO thought processes, representing both reactive and stable coping mechanisms (i.e., speech acts) for ensuring the safety of LEOs and the public at large. Accordingly, we propose (1) using this novel data source to understand how LEOs and MMYs come to perceive each other, (2) test a similarly novel survey instrument for measuring LEO identification with minority youth, in the process determining how much meaningful information can be reliably extracted from audio recordings of BPC for identifying racial discrimination in policing without the need to access highly sensitive police records or video recording data.",Primed to (re)act: Can changes in procedural language prevent adverse events between police and minority male youth?,10121621,R01MD015064,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Affective', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Chicago', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Police', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Stressful Event', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trust', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'Youth', 'acronyms', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'combat', 'coping', 'coping mechanism', 'course development', 'data quality', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'lens', 'male', 'member', 'novel', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial discrimination', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'social']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,744667
"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",10120737,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation framework', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'remote monitoring', 'remote patient monitoring', 'risk prediction', 'routine care', 'safety outcomes', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,645032
"Transcriptome-driven inference of adverse drug interactions ABSTRACT Ototoxicity is a debilitating side effect of over 150 medications, many of which are prescribed as part of multi- drug regimens to treat a broad range of conditions including cancer and recalcitrant infections. Adverse drug- drug interactions (DDIs) that potentiate ototoxicity complicate the implementation of multi-drug regimens, particularly to treat multiple concurrent conditions. In most cases, DDIs are currently detected only after the drugs are on the market, so effective preclinical methods to identify potential adverse interactions would facilitate safer co-prescriptions. The astronomical number of combinations renders measuring all possible drug interactions infeasible, so predicting how ototoxic drugs interact from data of individual compounds is necessary. While the current understanding of mechanisms underlying ototoxicity of specific drug classes has helped to explain clinical observations of specific adverse ototoxicity DDIs, and aided rational design of candidate otoprotective adjuvants, this strategy cannot anticipate adverse ototoxicity DDIs or develop otoprotectants for other lesser studied drug classes and first-in-class drugs under clinical development. To survey more broadly for potential ototoxicity DDIs, we will adapt INDIGO (Inferring Drug Interactions using chemo-Genomics and Orthology), a machine learning tool that currently can predict synergy/antagonism of antimicrobial drug activity in multiple bacterial species without requiring specific drug target information. We hypothesize that we can harness the underlying approach to predict potentially adverse (synergistic) or protective (antagonistic) ototoxic DDIs in humans, by building an “INDIGO-Tox” model based on data generated from an appropriate animal system. We will measure transcriptional profiles elicited by 15 drugs known to convey ototoxicity or otoprotection, as well as corresponding pairwise ototoxicity DDI phenotypes in zebrafish, a well-established in vivo model system for studying ototoxicity. We will use these data to train INDIGO-Tox model. We will then use INDIGO-Tox to predict DDIs between 10 additional drugs, using their zebrafish transcriptome response profiles as input data. We will validate predictions in zebrafish, and will test translation of top validated predictions in a well-established mouse ex vivo model of ototoxicity. We will also use the model to generate predictions for novel genes that influence ototoxicity, which we will then test in zebrafish. Successful completion will generate hypotheses for translation into humans, facilitate model expansion to assessing possible ototoxic interactions for a broader library of drugs, and will establish a path to predict interactions between ototoxicity and other organ toxicities. N AR R AT IVE Drug-induced hearing injury is a debilitating, often irreversible side-effect of certain lifesaving medicines that are often prescribed as part of multi-drug regimens. As adverse drug-drug interactions can exacerbate ototoxicity, novel effective preclinical methods to identify potential interactions would facilitate safer co- prescriptions. Here we propose to develop and validate a computational tool, INDIGO-Tox, to predict ototoxic drug-drug interactions and identify genes that influence these interactions.",Transcriptome-driven inference of adverse drug interactions,9880239,R21DC018341,"['Adjuvant', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Models', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Hair Cells', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injury', 'Labyrinth', 'Larva', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Regimen', 'Sampling', 'Stains', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Zebrafish', 'antimicrobial drug', 'base', 'clinical development', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'human model', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'knock-down', 'lateral line', 'loss of function', 'model building', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'otoprotectant', 'ototoxicity', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical assessment', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'side effect', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDCD,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,186000
"A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease We propose to develop, optimize, and conduct first in-human measurements of our Magnetic Flexible Endoscope (MFE) robotic platform that may provide a safer and more intelligent alternative to standard colonoscopy (CLS) for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at intervals less than that recommended for the general population. Thus, over the course of their lifetime, they are subjected to more frequent CLS than their non-lBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in adverse events. The main risks of CLS are related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making CLS a procedure that requires a great degree of technical skill and experience to perform safely. By using the proposed robotic platform, the endoscopist will be able to control the motion of the MFE to perform navigation, diagnosis, and therapy (i.e. biopsy, polyp removal/retrieval, injection) inside the human colon. MFE motion is achieved by magnetic coupling between an external permanent magnet (attached to a robotic arm outside the patient's body) and an internal permanent magnet (located inside the proximal head of the MFE). A small-diameter flexible tether between the head of the endoscope and the distal control module (outside the patient's body) allows for passage of commercially available therapeutic tools, insufflation, irrigation, suction/aspiration, and electrical wiring. Employing magnetic attraction at the head of the endoscope, for advancement and manipulation, permits the tether to follow passively-reducing the risk of mesenteric stretching or looping when compared to the traditional colonoscope. We will leverage our experience and extensive preliminary results to test the hypotheses that (1) intelligent robotic control and assistive autonomy in endoscopic tasks improves endoscopic performance, (2) quantifying the portion of colon lumen visualized provides valuable feedback to improve MFE operation and diagnostic yield, and (3) that the MFE is safe and successfully functions in the human colon in a manner similar to conventional CLS. The investigative team, combining engineering and clinical faculty, is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study-collectively possessing expertise in endoscopic device design, clinical CLS, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal technologies, robotics, magnetism, image processing, artificial intelligence, and translation of research-engineering developments into clinical applications. Additionally, the investigators have a long-standing history of close and fruitful collaboration including R01 EB018992. If successful, this approach will demonstrate first in-human use of the MFE that reduces potential adverse events in an at-risk population (IBD patients), is intuitive to control, and integrates intelligent guidance into colon exploration and inspection. The robotic platform we propose has the potential to provide a safer, more accessible, and potentially painless alternative to standard colonoscopy for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's disease)-a disease that impacts the lives of over three million Americans, who are at a 6-fold increased risk for post-colonoscopy adverse events when compared to their non-lBD counterparts. The platform uses magnetic actuation, intelligent closed-loop control, and integrated assistive autonomy of our diagnostic and therapeutic magnetic flexible endoscope (MFE) to facilitate intuitive endoscopist-directed motion under precise control with a novel colon-visualization-index (CVI) that provides feedback to the endoscopist with estimates of the portion of colon lumen successfully imaged to maximize the yield of exam. We propose the first in-human study of a magnetically actuated robotic platform for colonoscopy and the first in-human demonstration of intelligent control with assistive autonomy using magnetic fields.",A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,10121126,R01EB018992,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Articulation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Caliber', 'Cecum', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopes', 'Colonoscopy', 'Complication', 'Coupling', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dysplasia', 'Electric Wiring', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Injections', 'Insufflation', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Intubation', 'Intuition', 'Irrigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Mesentery', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nature', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Painless', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Polyps', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Prognosis', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Software Validation', 'Stream', 'Stretching', 'Suction', 'Surface', 'Technical Degree', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'capsule', 'clinical application', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'detection method', 'experience', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'gastrointestinal', 'human study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'lifetime risk', 'magnetic field', 'novel', 'operation', 'pain patient', 'phantom model', 'porcine model', 'prevent', 'procedure safety', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'trial comparing']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,316138
"Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign Project Summary/Abstract Written The objective of the proposed research is to reduce the patient safety hazards associated with electronic medication administration records (eMARs) by, (1) understanding current usability and safety gaps, and (2) creating design and development documents, wireframes, and prototypes to serve as the foundation for future eMARs that will eliminate these gaps. In particular, we focus on communication and information flow challenges between nurses, pharmacists, and physicians during medication administration and use of the eMAR. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-16-009). We will develop a broad understanding of usability and safety hazards associated with eMARs by analyzing a large dataset of 1.7 million patient safety event reports and detailed medication error related narratives. We will then conduct heuristic analyses of current eMARs, and interviews and observations of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. These data will serve to inform the development of eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes as the foundation for future development. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health information technology (health IT), informatics, and data science. Our research team includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and human factors engineers, and experts in natural language processing. In addition, our partnerships include a patient safety organization and a health IT vendor. The proposal addresses fundamental aspects of the call for proposals by providing new insights on the safety of health IT and improves current practices by developing use cases and new prototypes for immediate use by healthIT vendors. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the role of health IT during medication administration with a focus on communication and information flow, design, development and testing documents for vendors and providers, and eMAR wireframes and prototypes to improve development.

"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The proposed research and career development plan are relevant to public health because health care- associated infections (HAIs) affect about one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $30 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. The objective of this project is to develop robust and portable automated surveillance toolkit that combines structured EHR data with rich information locked in clinical notes using natural language processing to identify HAIs after surgical procedures.

The CAHPS V project will advance the AHRQ CAHPS mission of improving patients' experiences with health care by developing and evaluating strategies for survey measurement, reporting and quality improvement (QI). We propose a 5-year effort to advance the science and practice of patient experience assessment, continue innovation to ensure relevance to health service delivery and implement best survey practices, further the science of reporting, and evaluate CAHPS QI efforts. We will develop program communication strategies, and disseminate and promote use of CAHPS products. In particular, we will develop a survey to assess patient experiences with end-of-life care; develop new items to assess shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety; test alternatives to the standard CAHPS modes of data collection), explore the feasibility of administering a short-form survey dividing CG-CAHPS composites among respondents to reduce response burden, elicit stakeholder feedback about the value of different CAHPS supplement item sets, evaluate “The Your CAHPS Survey” that was designed to help users of the CAHPS surveys compile a survey tailed to their specific needs, and evaluate existing Spanish translations of CAHPS surveys. In addition, we will gather input from stakeholders on best practices for narrative data analysis, develop an approach for using automated Natural Language Processing for analyses of narratives, and construct an algorithm approach to select representative narratives that reflect and illustrate overall provider ratings. Finally, we will evaluate the contribution of patient narratives to quality improvement efforts in hospital care for children, characterize primary care practices use of the CG-CAHPS survey and patient-centered medical home items during PCMH transformation, assess the impact of pay- for-performance for care delivered by primary and specialty care safety net providers on CAHPS survey responses, explore the value of new shared decision-making, patient engagement, communication and patient safety items for QI and identify QI strategies that improve patient experience across various settings.

"Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed project aims to make healthcare safer through collection of patient-centered outcomes as the input data to support a safety and improvement model of the Learning Health System (LHS). The project will accomplish these aims by leveraging existing machine learning methods to classify free text documents, such as clinician notes, for the presence or absence of specific events of interest. The project shares this focus with two long-term objectives. The first broad project goal is to collect important data to address knowledge gaps in the incidence and clinical epidemiology of 5 serious pediatric inpatient healthcare acquired conditions (HACs). These 5 HACs are: peripheral IV infiltrates, venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), pressure injuries, patient falls, and incidents involving harm to providers. The second goal is to evaluate a novel approach to routine patient safety event surveillance that is scalable, transferrable, adaptable to other conditions and settings, and with low cost of sustainable ongoing operation. The project has two specific aims to achieve these goals:  Aim 1: Implement enhanced surveillance for 5 pediatric HACs. Compare characteristics  of previously and newly identified cases. Describe high-risk populations.  Aim 2: Estimate completeness of existing systems. Evaluate effects of enhanced  surveillance on quality improvement activities; incidence of HACs; and cost to operate  system, including staff time and resources. The project team has developed a machine learning interface implemented in open license Windows software. The team has a lengthy track record making these methods accessible to clinicians and lay users in research, clinical operations, quality improvement, and injury prevention settings. The current project proposes an innovative application of these technologies, methods, and tools to the important problem of patient safety surveillance. An expected outcome of this project will be substantial advance in knowledge for each of the 5 pediatric HACs proposed for enhanced surveillance. Results will be reported in terms of existing data completeness and clinical epidemiology. Findings will directly address concerns over limitations of existing data sources and thereby drive patient safety improvement activities. An additional expected outcome will be the rigorous evaluation of a novel approach to patient safety surveillance. This will include analysis of the costs and benefits of enhanced surveillance with machine learning versus current approaches, and the cost-effectiveness of the approach compared to reliance on existing data, and external validation at a partner community hospital. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project addresses important challenges to reduce common sources of harm in pediatric healthcare, namely the “Healthcare-Acquired Conditions (HACs)” monitored by the National Solutions for Patient Safety quality improvement initiative. It uses a new approach to identify previously unreported safety events that affect hospitalized pediatric patients. The findings from these studies will identify high-risk patient populations and new approaches for quality improvement to reduce the frequency of these events of harm among hospitalized children.",Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes,10202727,R01HS026246,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,396733

"Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool Existing methods for surveillance of patient harm in the ED setting are inadequate, without any meaningful change in decades. Trigger tools, popularized by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Global Trigger Tool, have been developed for multiple clinical areas and are used across the world, outperform traditional approaches for surveillance of adverse events. These tools use a two-tiered review process where a nurse screens records for triggers (predefined findings that make the presence of an AE more likely) and reviews records with triggers for AEs, discarding those without triggers. We developed a consensus-based ED trigger tool (EDTT) using a multicenter, transdisciplinary modified Delphi approach, subsequently pilot testing this in a multicenter fashion with encouraging results. This was followed by a recently completed, AHRQ-funded single center study to automate, refine and validate this tool. This study demonstrated that the EDTT is a high-yield and efficient instrument for identifying adverse events in the ED. The present study will evaluate the refined, automated EDTT), in a multicenter study. We will evaluate the EDTT’s generalizability and robustness at three sites with large emergency departments, with a planned in-depth review of 9,000 ED admissions. We will use natural language processing of electronic medical record narratives and machine learning to improve the EDTT efficiency in trigger detection and AE discovery. We will establish the basis for a wider use and prepare for scalability and usability of the tool, creating standardized, streamlined and free online training materials, and by evaluating the tool in a real-world manner consistent with intended use. Project Narrative Commonly used approaches in Emergency Departments to detect adverse events are low yield and have not changed in decades, providing inadequate surveillance for patient harm. The need for improved methodology is critical, given the evolving role of the emergency department in the health care system. Trigger tools, developed for use in many healthcare settings across the world, detect all-cause harm, helping direct resources by identifying areas of risk and allowing an assessment of the effectiveness of quality improvement efforts over time. Trigger tools involve screening of records by a nurse for triggers (findings that make an adverse event more likely) and a review of only records with triggers searching for adverse events. Any events identified undergo confirmatory physician review. We developed a trigger tool for the ED, applying rigorous methods to identify predictive triggers, to computerize the screen for triggers eliminating manual review and improving record selection to enhance yield and efficiency. This tool demonstrates superior performance for detecting adverse events. We will now test this tool in a multicenter project to evaluate its broad application, confirming its utility and to continue to improve its yield and efficiency in adverse event detection by applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques.",Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool,10265522,R01HS027811,[' '],AHRQ,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,386126
"ExPERTS-PC: Engaging Patients in Event ReporTing for Safety in Primary Care PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Ambulatory adverse drug events (ADEs) occur in 25% of new prescriptions and cause an estimated 4.5 million office visits and 100,000 hospitalizations per year, with patients from vulnerable populations experiencing higher rates of ADEs. Patients and caregivers are responsible for medication self-management and observe ADEs in the home and community, but are not engaged in detecting or reporting ADEs to ambulatory care teams. The objective of this proposal is to fill this gap by developing a stakeholder-designed tool for patient- initiated ADE reporting. Aim 1 utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to identify patient, caregiver and healthcare team contributory causes identified in ADE reports from a multistate Patient Safety Organization. Aim 2 employs user-centered design to develop and conduct feasibility testing of a prototype text messaging- based patient-initiated ADE reporting system, working with patients, caregivers and primary care personnel from the public health safety net, targeting factors identified in Aim 1. This tool will be adapted from an inpatient text-messaging tool and adapted specifically for low-health literacy primary care patients. Candidate Anjana Sharma, MD, MAS, is Assistant Professor of Family & Community Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). She has expertise in mixed methods and observational research studying patient engagement in quality and safety for vulnerable populations. In this proposal, Dr. Sharma seeks to build skills in natural language processing, user-centered design for low-health-literacy populations, and intervention development to enable her to design a patient-initiated ADE reporting tool. Dr. Sharma has assembled a skilled mentorship team, led by ambulatory patient quality and safety expert Dr. Urmimala Sarkar, including NLP expert Dr. Atul Butte, user-centered design expert Dr. Courtney Lyles, and primary care leader Dr. Kevin Grumbach. The career development plan benefits from the extensive resources available at UCSF and substantial material and methodologic support from the Department of Family & Community Medicine. This proposal is significant because it expands the limited knowledge base about harms from high-risk medications occurring in ambulatory care, and develops a novel means to measure ambulatory ADEs through patient- initiated reports. The work is aligned with Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's priority areas of medication safety, ambulatory safety, and patient engagement. Aim 2 focuses on AHRQ priority populations of urban, low-income and ethnic minority populations. The skills and findings from this proposal will translate into an R-level proposal for a randomized trial of the patient-initiated ADE reporting tool in a safety-net primary care network. The proposed career development will advance Dr. Sharma toward her goals of research independence, expertise in developing interventions that engage patients and family caregivers, and national leadership in ambulatory care safety and quality for vulnerable populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because medication adverse events cause substantial morbidity and cost, yet little is known about how patient and caregivers can participate in monitoring and reporting medication adverse events occurring in the home and community. The proposal will describe outpatient medication adverse events from a previously unexplored Patient Safety Organization database, then develop a text-message-based patient-initiated medication adverse event reporting tool for identifying ambulatory events related to the high-risk medications warfarin, insulin, and opioids. The project is relevant to the priorities of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), including medication safety, ambulatory care safety, patient and caregiver engagement, the role of Patient Safety Organizations, and adverse event reporting.",ExPERTS-PC: Engaging Patients in Event ReporTing for Safety in Primary Care,10284478,K08HS028477,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K08,2021,148735
"Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial PROJECT SUMMARY Overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the United States since 1999. The epidemic has prompted widespread federal and state actions, yet the number of people who die of an overdose continues to increase. In light of the accelerating and rapidly evolving overdose epidemic, new strategies are needed to identify communities most at risk, and to utilize resources more effectively to curb overdose deaths. To address these public health priorities, we will develop a forecasting tool to predict overdose deaths before they occur, and then conduct a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention to evaluate resource targeting based on these predictions. The study will take place in Rhode Island, a state with the 10th highest rate of overdose fatality in 2016. The study has two phases. First, we will develop a predictive analytics model that forecasts future overdose mortality at the neighborhood-level, using publicly available information and data from a multicomponent overdose surveillance system. This tool, called PROVIDENT (Preventing Overdose using Information and Data from the Environment) will be used to predict the likelihood of magnitude of future overdose deaths in every neighborhood across Rhode Island. Next, we will conduct a randomized policy experiment to evaluate whether targeting overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods at highest risk reduces overdose morbidity and mortality. The state's department of health will receive PROVIDENT model predictions for half of the 39 cities/towns in Rhode Island. Within these cities/town, the health department will work with stakeholders to target overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods with the highest probability of future overdose deaths. Interventions include efforts to: (1) prevent high-risk prescribing (through academic detailing and other educational efforts); (2) expand access to opioid agonist therapy, including buprenorphine and methadone; (3) increase naloxone distribution (through community and pharmacy-based efforts); and (4) expand street-based peer recovery coaching and referrals. Control cities/town will continue to receive these interventions, but without targeting to specific neighborhoods. Fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in the control cities/towns will be compared to those that received the PROVIDENT model predictions. To achieve these aims, we will leverage a unique partnership between an academic institution and a state's health department, which allows for unprecedented access to and sharing of population-based overdose surveillance data. Our results will improve public health decision-making and inform resource allocation to communities that should be prioritized for evidence-based prevention, treatment, recovery, and overdose rescue services. If found to be effective, the PROVIDENT forecasting model will be disseminated to other states, which could adapt the tool to guide resource allocation and maximize public health impact. In sum, this project is highly responsive to a top research priority of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and directly addresses one of the nation's most challenging public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objectives of this project are to leverage surveillance data to predict future overdose outbreaks, and to evaluate the impact of a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention trial to target overdose prevention programs to neighborhoods at highest risk of future overdose deaths. This study develops and tests an opioid overdose forecasting tool, which will allow other states to identify and deploy interventions to communities at highest risk of opioid-related death. This results study will significantly improve the allocation of resources to curb the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States.","Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial",10220922,R01DA046620,"['Academic Detailing', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'American', 'Area', 'Buprenorphine', 'Censuses', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Community Pharmacy', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Community Trial', 'Intervention Trial', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methadone', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neighborhoods', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Research Priority', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid policy', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'overdose prevention', 'overdose risk', 'peer', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'preventive intervention', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'referral services', 'resource guides', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment arm']",NIDA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,807350
"National Drug Early Warning System Coordinating Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our team enthusiastically submits this proposal to be the next NDEWS Coordinating Center (CC) in response to RFA DA-20-016. The CC is spearheaded by the Cottler Lab (Epidemiology), with investigators from University of Florida's Center for Addiction Research & Education (Nixon, Goldberger, Striley), the Palamar Lab at New York University and the Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Lab-Barenholtz) at Florida Atlantic University. Our CC will maintain strong sentinel surveillance efforts while expanding our Early Warning Network sites, adding leading edge indicators that extend beyond lagged city-level data. We will extend the work of NIDA-funded researchers, while harmonizing and analyzing data, with timely and systematic notifications. The new NDEWS CC will work to seamlessly transition on-going efforts, advance methods and approaches, establish and engage a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG), and collaborate with all consortium components to accomplish these Specific Aims: 1) Provide an Early Warning Network of 12 NDEWS sites and 6 Community Epidemiology Workgroup sites for ongoing surveillance of urban, rural, and suburban areas; 2) Utilize established and new key community-level indicators for ongoing surveillance to assess trends in availability, use, and consequences of NPS and known substances, standardized across all sites to facilitate cross-site analyses; 3) Incorporate and leverage novel surveillance methods to ensure early detection of signals of NPS and emerging drug trends, including data from DanceSafe “drug checkers,” Rapid Street Reporting (RSR) with hair testing for NPS exposure, the implementation of a virtual HealthStreet substance user network, and development of an innovative machine learning approach to detect emergence of NPS in real-time through drug retailers (including the “darknet”) and social media platforms; 4) Harmonize standardized indicator definitions for all incoming surveillance data with the input of NIDA, the SAG, and Early Warning Network experts; facilitate cross-site comparability of data; manage quality control; organize, coordinate, and summarize data, and provide organizational and logistical support; 5) Disseminate findings quickly via dashboards modeled after Florida Drug-related Outcomes Surveillance and Tracking System (FROST); push notifications for regular updates and alerts; webinars; virtual Our Community Our Health Town Hall meetings; and traditionally through official reports, peer-reviewed publications, media, and annual reporting at CPDD, and elsewhere; 6) Conduct on-the-ground epidemiologic investigations on topics of immediate crisis or need; 7) Provide operational, administrative, and logistical support to the enterprise and NIDA; and 8) Train the next generation of scientists in NDEWS methodology.  NDEWS has unrealized potential, and with this funding, we will transform the culture so that NDEWS is NIDA's and the field's go-to source for drug trends in the US. It will provide evidence-based prevention and intervention strategies to eventually reduce the harmful effects of substance use around the world. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is nothing more aligned with the NIDA Strategic Plan to protect the public health than detecting signals of emerging drug use trends. This proposal coordinates the data collection efforts from 18 sites and NIDA funded investigators to notify people everywhere of the signals detected. With this information, immediate responses can take place for interventions.

"A Multicenter RCT of Pharmacist-Directed Transitional Care to Reduce Post-Hospitalization Utilization The sickest patients in the community are recently hospitalized elders. A substantial component of their morbidity and mortality is caused by adverse drug events (ADEs). ADEs account for 70% of adverse events occurring after discharge, which occur at a rate of 0.30 ADEs per patient. The oldest, sickest patients are at highest risk for ADEs because they have the most complex and hazardous medication regimens yet the least physiologic reserve and the fewest social and economic resources.  Several studies, including our own, have demonstrated the efficacy of pharmacist-led post-discharge interventions to improve medication management. Most prominent among these have been post-discharge phone calls from pharmacists to patients. However, despite demonstrated efficacy, these interventions have not been widely implemented. In this proposal, we use the RE-AIM model to understand and address gaps in existing research that have hindered implementation. The central knowledge gap is that most research focuses on process or surrogate endpoint measures (like medication discrepancies) that we now understand to be insufficient to motivate organizational change. In contrast, we will measure the effect on utilization, a closely-tracked outcome that strongly motivates hospital leaders. We will use a large randomized controlled trial to rigorously assess the effect of PHARM-DC on this outcome. We will also study the barriers and facilitators of adopting these interventions, about which little is known. Finally, although implementation costs are critically important information for organizations considering pharmacist-led discharge (PHARM-DC) interventions, evidence on this topic is scarce. We thus aim to measure the impact of PHARM-DC interventions on post-discharge utilization within 30 days. We will also identify patient sub-populations most likely to benefit from PHARM-DC. Finally, we will estimate the incremental net cost of PHARMs from the health system perspective.  To study these aims, we have selected two sites that: 1) are already proficient at in-hospital medication reconciliation, a prerequisite for implementing and evaluating PHARM-DC; 2) have a Chief Pharmacy Officer committed to using operational resources to provide PHARM-DC to patients during the study period; and 3) have investigators experienced in the research content and methodologies needed to study the aforementioned aims.  This project will generate new knowledge allowing for increased implementation and dissemination of research already known to be efficacious, thus reducing the substantial morbidity and mortality attributable to ADEs among seniors in the high risk post-discharge time period. After being hospitalized, our nation’s large and growing population of older adult patients is often harmed by medication errors. This project will study known methods of reducing medication errors, especially by involving pharmacists.

"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers. Through SPEEDe, we will develop an innovative machine- learning approach for accurately detecting adverse events in the elderly in real-time.",Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe),10109965,R01AG062499,"['Active Learning', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'detection platform', 'detector', 'forging', 'hands-on learning', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'open source', 'open source tool', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NIA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,661688
"Generating Evidence on Deprescribing Safety PROJECT SUMMARY: GEODES R01 AG070047-01 Older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCC), especially those with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), have an increased risk of polypharmacy, adverse drug events, treatment burden, and cognitive changes from medication side effects. Deprescribing is the process of reducing or stopping inappropriate medications or medications unlikely to be beneficial supervised by a health-care professional. Patients, caregivers for people with ADRD, and clinicians list potential adverse drug withdrawal events (ADWE) following medication discontinuation as a key barrier to deprescribing. ADWE are not well reported by deprescribing trials, and no large-scale interventions have reported prevalence or predictors of ADWE. Further, ADWE presenting in ambulatory care are rarely captured. This lack of evidence is largely due to inadequate methods for measuring ADWE: Identifying and measuring ADWE requires knowing the timing of medication discontinuation and understanding whether subsequent symptoms or diagnoses constitute ADWE. Our experience with safety monitoring for the OPTMIZE intervention of deprescribing education in ADRD (R33AG057289, MPIs Bayliss / Boyd), a pragmatic, cluster randomized trial to increase deprescribing awareness among patients with ADRD, their family, and primary care clinicians, has exemplified these methodologic gaps and provided the impetus for the proposed work. The project will leverage knowledge and methods from safety monitoring for the ADRD population in OPTIMIZE, combined with rich longitudinal clinical and pharmacy data from the Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) EHR and Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW) to develop and test methods to generate robust evidence on deprescribing safety. Our study populations will be older adults with MCC and the OPTIMIZE population with dementia plus MCC. Aim 1 will identify individuals who experience medication discontinuation and subsequent ADWE using record review and adjudication. Aim 2 will develop and validate a text mining tool to identify medication discontinuation applicable to multiple classes of medications. Aim 3 will apply the text mining tool in combination with common ADWE diagnoses in two separate cohorts to demonstrate a data-based approach to identifying medication discontinuation and possible ADWE: a sample of older adults with MCC and the OPTIMIZE population of individuals with dementia plus MCC. Aim 4 will model patient and clinical factors predictive of ADWE in the ADRD and MCC populations. Generating adequate evidence to support safe and effective deprescribing for ADRD and MCC populations requires new data-based methods and approaches. Project Narrative Patient-centered care should include medical treatment to achieve goals of care, but not medicines that are either likely to be harmful or unhelpful. Deprescribing is the process of reducing or stopping the use of inappropriate medications or medications unlikely to be beneficial supervised by a health-care professional. We will develop and test a novel tool and methods to generate adequate safety evidence to support thoughtful and effective deprescribing using a new data-based approach.",Generating Evidence on Deprescribing Safety,10096865,RF1AG070047,"['Address', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Adverse drug event', 'Aging', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Colorado', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Store', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Interactions', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medication Management', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physiological', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Reflux', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Tachycardia', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'drug withdrawal', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'population based', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'study population', 'text searching', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,RF1,2021,1923910
"Computational methods using electronic health records and registry data to detect and predict clinical outcomes in rheumatic disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This is a new application for a K01 award for Dr. Milena Gianfrancesco, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine, who plans a research program focusing on understanding risk factors as they relate to rheumatic disease patient outcomes, such as adverse events. Combined with a training plan focused on computational text mining methods and advanced causal inference statistics, the goal of the current study is to use large electronic health record and national registry data that reflects real-world prescribing patterns to examine the risk of infection attributed to biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). While biologic medications have improved disease control and are associated with significant gains in patients’ quality of life, several studies have demonstrated that biologic use is associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events, such as infection. How this risk differs based on a variety of patient factors, such as age, race, and ethnicity, is currently unknown, leaving clinicians with insufficient information to predict the probability of an adverse event occurring in a given patient who is prescribed a particular biologic. This proposal will utilize established local electronic health record and national registry data to examine over 80,000 individuals with RA and SLE to address three specific aims. In Aim 1, Dr. Gianfrancesco will apply and validate a text mining system to identify incident clinical and opportunistic infections from clinical notes. In Aim 2, Dr. Gianfrancesco will use the same databases to determine the longitudinal causal effect of biologics on risk of infection. In Aim 3, a risk-assessment model to predict risk of infection will be developed and validated in a rheumatology clinic. Findings from this study will further elucidate factors associated with infectious risk for individuals prescribed biologics, thereby improving their safety in the ambulatory settings. Dr. Gianfrancesco has assembled an exceptional mentorship team with expertise in computational text mining methods, advanced causal inference statistics, rheumatology and patient safety outcomes, as well as experience using national registry data to address these questions. She will have access to a rich research environment and provided support for career development through programs such as the UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute K-scholars program. Formal coursework and mentoring will also be supplemented with attendance at national conferences related to rheumatology, epidemiology, and informatics.

"Machine learning approaches towards risk assessment and prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY The primary objectives of this project include understanding the interplay between molecular, genetic and clinical factors related to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), method development for accurate risk assessment of APOs well before they occur, and method development for collecting additional clinical data in routine treatment of at-risk-subjects. Towards these goals we have assembled a team of investigators with clinical, translational, and computational expertise capable of identifying novel contributors to APOs as well as facilitating clinician-patient interactions using data-driven and theoretically sound machine learning approaches. Our strategies will rely on advanced machine learning as well as integration of clinical, genetic, and molecular data and hold promise to bring precision medicine to the treatment and experience of women during and post pregnancy. We will predominantly rely on the data collected during the national “Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: monitoring mothers-to-be”; i.e., the nuMoM2b study. Using the cohort of 10,038 nulliparous women, we will efficiently accomplish 3 Aims: to integrate genetic, clinical, and molecular features towards a deep understanding of APOs; to develop machine learning models for advanced risk prediction; and to engage in active data collection towards risk assessment and model development. Using a close collaboration between computational and clinical scientists, we believe this proposal will result in important advances in understanding the molecular and clinical aspects of APOs as well as assessing the risk for APOs and thus providing tangible contributions to maternal health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Utilizing advanced machine learning as well as integration of clinical, genetic, and molecular data, this proposal seeks tangible advances in individualized risk prediction for adverse pregnancy outcomes. This research is relevant to public health in that it will provide mechanistic insights and opportunities for personalized prevention strategies for avoiding adverse pregnancy outcomes.",Machine learning approaches towards risk assessment and prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes,10226370,R01HD101246,"['Adverse event', 'Ally', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Goals', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Health', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nulliparity', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Physiological', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'antenatal', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'design', 'dietary', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetus at risk', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'insight', 'method development', 'model development', 'novel', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personalized risk prediction', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'sound', 'structured data', 'success']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,437901
"Mobile Diagnosis of Congenital Genetic Conditions: A Model for Screening and Surveillance in Low-Resource Settings SUMMARY Congenital anomalies represent an increasing burden of disease worldwide, accounting for millions of birth defect-related disabilities with a disproportionate impact on Low to Middle Income Countries (LIMCs). Many harbor genetic etiologies, for which no confirmatory diagnosis can be made due to the dearth of diagnostic technologies in most LMICs. The inability to rapidly and accurately diagnose individuals that harbor a genetic syndrome increases the risk of mortality and morbidity (as a number of manageable congenital anomalies may be hidden, such as congenital heart defects or hearing infections) and prevents the accurate determination of prevalence rates, critical for public health surveillance and intervention programs. The first part (R21) of this project addresses these gaps using two synergistic mobile health intervention tools to screen for syndromic conditions and specifically demonstrate that a specific diagnostic of Down syndrome (expandable to all aneuploidies and those diseases resulting from copy number variants, point mutations and insertions/deletions) can be performed with minimal resources, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Aim 1 will be to train and validate AI-guided smartphone-based technology to screen for syndromic conditions, while Aim 2 will create low-cost, rapid initial genetic diagnostic capacity in the DRC. In the expansion part of the proposal (R33), we will test whether the implementation of a registry measuring health outcomes can be used as a scalable model for future newborn screening and health surveillance in a low-resource setting. To this effect, Aim 3 will build infrastructure for birth defects detection, genetic confirmation, competence building, and practice and outcomes surveillance in low-resource conditions with two parallel sub-aims: Aim 3a will assess the feasibility of the diagnostic capacity on a large population sample and provide a tool to measure specific health outcomes, while Aim 3b will establish a small-scale and functional database/registry of morphological, genetic, and health outcomes data. In limited resources settings, comprehensive systems to detect, refer, treat and surveil individuals with congenital anomalies are non-existent. Our innovative technologies will address this gap, build local capacity of diagnostic screening and of a data registry, allowing for early diagnosis and condition-specific care, likely to lower morbidity and mortality of children with non-communicable syndromic conditions. Millions of individuals in Low-to-Middle-Income Countries are affected by birth defects, representing a major global Public Health burden. We propose innovative low-cost strategies for reducing the impact of birth defects, based on mobile, facial recognition software to screen for dysmorphic syndromes (including Down syndrome), coupled with practical genetic solutions for early diagnosis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Our partnership between Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale, a DRC national research institute, and Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC, will create the infrastructure of a birth defect Registry, allowing for future surveillance and intervention programs in low resource settings.",Mobile Diagnosis of Congenital Genetic Conditions: A Model for Screening and Surveillance in Low-Resource Settings,10267068,R21HD102988,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aneuploidy', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Birth Rate', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cheek structure', 'Child', 'Child Mortality', 'Competence', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Democratic Republic of the Congo', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fellowship', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Registries', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Students', 'Surveillance Program', 'Swab', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Washington', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'computerized', 'congenital anomaly', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data registry', 'design', 'diagnostic screening', 'diagnostic technologies', 'disability', 'facial recognition software', 'follow-up', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic resource', 'global health', 'health care quality', 'health care service', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'intervention program', 'mHealth', 'mortality risk', 'neonatal health', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rapid diagnosis', 'screening', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'transposon/insertion element']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2021,399475
"Clinical trial emulation to assess drug safety in pregnant patients ABSTRACT Pregnant people are a vulnerable population: healthcare professionals must exercise caution in prescribing many common pharmaceuticals to expectant patients, given potential risk of injury to a developing fetus. Arguably, teratogenicity is the most serious manifestation of fetal toxicity, as teratogens lead to fetal malformation and are implicated in physical and mental disabilities throughout the life course of an affected child. Consideration of teratogenicity, however, is a largely nonsystematic process. While regulatory agencies like the United States Food and Drug Administration have established discrete teratogenicity scores for evaluating drug safety, these classification criteria provide little concrete distinction among score classes, making it difficult for pharmaceutical scientists to systematically determine the teratogenic potential of a drug. This effect ripples to the bedside, as providers lack robust data on most drugs to inform their judgements of safety, efficacy, and risk in recommending therapies to expectant patients. Consequently, treatment of many diseases during pregnancy remains understudied and uncertain, for fear of causing harm. To address these shortcomings and improve quality of care for pregnant patients and their unborn children, we propose the development of a holistic, generalizable framework for the identification of teratogenic drug exposures via a new paradigm of clinical pharmacovigilance. Therefore, given our inability to evaluate drug safety in pregnant patients in real time, the objective of our investigation is to develop an observational platform to uncover new drug safety information through strategic, associative analysis of medication history within the electronic health record (EHR) of a pregnant patient and developmental diseases within the EHRs of their neonates. This approach will harness 48,434 linked maternal and neonatal EHRs within the Research Derivative, a databank of identified EHRs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, across which we plan to apply and appropriately validate a medication-wide association study to uncover new, data-driven associations between maternal medication exposures and teratogenic health outcomes. To date, we have employed this technique to discover 129 associations between maternal drug exposure and neurodevelopmental diseases from existing primary care data, which recapitulate teratogens well-known to clinical practice that also serve as positive controls for our model. Now, we hope to expand our platform to encompass more advanced techniques of clinical trial emulation; if successful, we anticipate that discovering new toxicants through retrospective data modeling will greatly enhance our goal of systematically clarifying cases of suspect drug safety in pregnancy. In the long run, we hope this approach will allow clinicians to embrace a more accurate knowledge base in their evaluation of the risks and benefits in prescribing drugs with unclear teratogenic risks to their pregnant patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE From the perspective of regulatory agencies for public health and safety, it is unethical to perform clinical trials on pregnant people to assess drug safety and efficacy for the treatment of diseases of pregnancy; paradoxically, while this policy recognizes the vulnerability of an expectant mother and her unborn child, it has created a public health emergency for millions of pregnant patients, as clinicians lack robust data on treatments for these conditions and still do not know whether many common drugs are safe to prescribe to their pregnant patients. To address these problems, this project aims to harness the burgeoning science of machine learning to create a surrogate for randomized, controlled drug trials in pregnant populations, via the development of a “target trial” platform to discover new drug safety and efficacy insights from medication and disease data in linked maternal and neonatal electronic health records that were originally collected during routine medical care. Upon completion of this project, pharmaceutical scientists may employ the resulting target trial framework to clarify drug safety concerns for pregnant patients, and clinicians may benefit more definitive data in their choice of safe and effective medications for expectant mothers.",Clinical trial emulation to assess drug safety in pregnant patients,10232840,R21HD105304,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Birth', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Fetal Development', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infant Care', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Orphan', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Thalidomide', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Upper Extremity', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'data repository', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'human data', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'loss of function', 'malformation', 'medication safety', 'neonate', 'novel therapeutics', 'pharmacovigilance', 'phenome', 'point of care', 'preclinical study', 'pregnant', 'prevent', 'public health emergency', 'response', 'simulation', 'toxicant', 'unborn child', 'unethical']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2021,259500
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest.

"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"Early detection, containment, and management of COVID-19 in dialysis facilities using multi-modal data sources Abstract With older age and multiple comorbidities, dialysis patients are at high risk for serious complications, even death, from COVID-19. There is a large disproportionate representation of minorities, especially Blacks and Hispanics. Over 85% of hemodialysis patients travel three times a week to dialysis facilities to receive life-sustaining treatments and cannot shelter in place. There is a critical need to characterize COVID-19 transmission pathways in dialysis patients and clinics, identify potential coronavirus carriers, and develop procedures to curb the spread. With regular medical encounters, a large amount of data has been collected for each patient over time. These data have not been fully utilized for COVID-19 prediction and control in dialysis clinics. In this proposal, we seek to leverage demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, socioeconomic, serological, metabolomic, wearable and machine-integrated sensors, and COVID-19 surveillance data to develop mathematical and statistical models and implement them in a large number of dialysis clinics. The mathematical and statistical modeling using multiple data resources will help us understand how COVID-19 spread in dialysis facilities, identify potential COVID-19 patients before symptoms appear, and identify potential asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We will develop novel mathematical and statistical models that fully utilize the high dimensional multimodal data available to us and other dialysis providers. We capitalize on the intrinsic advantages of hemodialysis clinics to implement and validate the proposed prediction models. We firmly believe that this cross-disciplinary effort will improve patients’ and staff’s safety while delivering high-quality, individualized care to a high-risk population.

"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make use of the unstructured narratives in the VAERS reports to facilitate the temporal related discovery to a broad community of investigators in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, vaccine safety research, among others. Project Narrative Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine-preventable illnesses. In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. Currently the FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) only includes one onsite date in its database. The textual narratives in the reports are generally ignored primarily due to their unstructured nature. These narratives, however, contain more detailed information about the series of events that happened after vaccination, which could be valuable for more informed clinical studies. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs.

"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,10206237,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'data streams', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,486155
"Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework Project Summary / Abstract The proposed research aims to develop novel causal inference methods to resolve unmeasured confounding bias known to plague vaccine effectiveness and safety studies by leveraging so-called negative control variables widely available in vaccine studies. A negative control outcome is a variable known not to be causally affected by the treatment of interest, while a negative control exposure is a variable known not to causally affect the outcome of interest. Both share a common confounding mechanism as the exposure-outcome pair of primary interest. Examples of negative controls abound in vaccine studies. Such known-null effects form the basis of falsiﬁca- tion strategy to detect unmeasured confounding, however little is known about when and how negative controls can be used to resolve unmeasured confounding bias. We plan to develop principled negative control methods for identiﬁcation and semiparametric estimation of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding, incorporating modern highly adaptive machine learning methods. We also plan to develop negative control meth- ods to detect and quantify causal effects in complex longitudinal and survival settings critical to vaccine studies using routinely collected healthcare data. Finally we plan to apply the proposed methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness using data collected from a pioneering test-negative design platform and to monitor vaccine safety using electronic health record data. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip investigators with paradigm-shifting methods to unlock the full potential of contemporary healthcare data, encourage investigators to routinely check for evidence of confounding bias, and ultimately improve the validity of scientiﬁc research. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop statistical methods to detect and resolve unmeasured confounding bias by leveraging prior knowledge about known-null effects widely available but often underappreciated in healthcare data — thereby facilitating valid and reproducible research in vaccine effectiveness and safety studies.",Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework,10093358,R01GM139926,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Plague', 'Plague Vaccine', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'adverse event risk', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'effectiveness study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'public health priorities', 'safety study', 'semiparametric', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine evaluation', 'vaccine safety', 'vaccine trial']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,401613
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,10132378,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'provider behavior', 'side effect', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,143581
"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,10088471,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,768996
"Machine learning risk stratification in patients with ASCVD: A personalized approach 7. Project Summary/Abstract Patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) are at high risk of suffering from future ASCVD events despite contemporary preventive therapies, and this risk has been termed residual risk. Even with recent advances in cardiovascular interventions including statins, dual antiplatelet therapies, revascularization, and other therapies, ASCVD event rates among patients with prior ASCVD remain high (>3% per year). While a disproportionate number of events occur in patients who have prior ASCVD, risk assessment algorithms for predicting recurrent events occurring in these patients has been limited. Furthermore, patients with ASCVD have a range of risk, and recent guidelines now recommend tailoring the intensity of secondary prevention treatments to the patient's risk level. Yet personalized risk prediction models for patients with ASCVD are lacking. The goal of this project is to use advanced machine learning methods to develop and validate a novel risk score (Residual Risk Score) for predicting absolute long-term risk of future events among patients with ASCVD. Novel machine learning methods can analyze complex interactions and correlations between risk factors and other traits. We hypothesize that these computational approaches could be used to develop and validate a personalized risk assessment for patients with ASCVD. This project will contribute clinically meaningful and readily applicable results to directly impact a common clinical problem with high morbidity and cost burden; namely, reducing residual risk in ASCVD patients and personalizing their treatments. The Residual Risk Score will be provided as a free clinical tool and could be incorporated in the electronic health record or as an application. In this study, we will utilize a combination of data from biobanks, electronic health records, and population studies. In Specific Aim 1, we will use advanced computational methods to design and train an artificial neural network for predicting recurrent ASCVD events among patients with prior ASCVD. In Specific Aim 2, we focus on expanding the computational model with the capability of predicting these events in independent and diverse populations. This study will address an important unmet need for better risk stratification tools for patients with ASCVD. This would aid in identifying higher risk ASCVD patients more likely to suffer a recurrent event, and could be used to tailor novel and costly risk reduction strategies to higher risk patients. It has the potential to impact clinical care for shared decision-making discussions between healthcare providers and patients, as well as for clinical trials that target higher risk ASCVD patients for novel costly therapeutics. 8. Project Narrative Patients with prior heart disease or stroke are at increased risk of having a repeat event, with approximately 1 in 5 patients experiencing or dying from repeat events. However, there is a range of risk for patients, and a clear need exists for identifying those who are at higher risk of events despite taking medication. We propose to apply new artificial intelligence methods to develop a free and publicly available computer program that will calculate each patient's long-term chance of having or dying from a repeat heart attack or stroke based on his or her individual risk profile.",Machine learning risk stratification in patients with ASCVD: A personalized approach,10114664,R21HL156174,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'New York', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Preventive therapy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'computer program', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning method', 'multi-ethnic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized risk prediction', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'sex', 'shared decision making', 'tool', 'trait']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,134250
"Leveraging the Microbiome, Local Admixture, and Machine Learning to Optimize Anticoagulant Pharmacogenomics in Medically Underserved Patients ABSTRACT  Warfarin remains one of the most commonly prescribed drugs and a leading cause of emergency hospitalizations. Warfarin use is especially common in medically underserved patients such as African Americans (AAs) and Latinos, which is particularly concerning since AAs and Latinos suffer worse outcomes due to suboptimal warfarin therapy. Thus AAs and Latinos can derive a distinct benefit from warfarin pharmacogenomic (PGx) algorithms, which maximize safety and efficacy by predicting individualized warfarin dose. However, currently available PGx algorithms have critical limitations, including a lack of generalizability to non-white populations and a failure to account for 50 percent of variability in warfarin dose. Under-representation in clinical studies, the propensity to cause adverse events, and a lack of consideration of admixed populations in clinical PGx guidelines are all factors that contribute to limited utility of warfarin PGx algorithms in diverse populations. Many potential sources of warfarin stable dose variability remain critically unexplored, including the role of vitamin K biosynthesizing bacterial species, the influence of local ancestry at warfarin pharmacogenes, and the potential for machine learning techniques to enable accurate warfarin dosing algorithms in diverse populations. This proposal addresses the overarching hypothesis that warfarin stable dose prediction can be improved by incorporation of gut microbiome data, measures of local ancestry, and machine learning in diverse populations. We will pursue three Specific Aims (SAs) to test this hypothesis: (SA1) Determine the impact of abundance of vitamin K biosynthesizing bacteria from the gut microbiome on warfarin stable dose and; (SA2) Determine the influence of local admixture on warfarin stable dose in admixed populations; (SA3) Optimize warfarin PGx algorithms for diverse populations using machine learning. In SA#1, we will conduct a clinical study with fecal sample collection at anticoagulation clinic visits and perform whole genome bacterial sequencing to identify the effect of vitamin K biosynthesizing bacterial species on warfarin stable dose. In SA#2, we will estimate African, European, and Native American local ancestry in warfarin pharmacogenes in a large, admixed population (n=1194) and determine its effects on warfarin stable dose. In SA#3, a large, diverse population of warfarin treated patients (n=7366) will be used to develop machine learning models and test improved prediction of warfarin stable dose over existing linear regression models. Our studies overcome major limitations of previous warfarin PGx studies by leveraging gut microbiome data, local ancestry, machine learning, and diverse, admixed populations. The outcomes of this work will provide a framework for local ancestry investigation with other PGx drug-gene pairs, enabling use of clinical PGx guidelines in admixed populations. This research has the potential to identify new sources of variability in warfarin dose, improve the safety and efficacy of warfarin treatment, and reduce disparities in PGx research for medically underserved patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This research project will help define new factors that contribute to variability in therapeutic warfarin dose requirements. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it has the potential to improve genotype-guided warfarin dosing algorithms and reduce adverse drug events associated with warfarin therapy. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH mission that pertains to reducing the burden of adverse drug reactions in cardiovascular disease.","Leveraging the Microbiome, Local Admixture, and Machine Learning to Optimize Anticoagulant Pharmacogenomics in Medically Underserved Patients",10270784,R01HL158686,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Admixture', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'CYP2C9 gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diet Records', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Receptors', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Escherichia coli', 'European', 'Failure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Latino', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vitamin K', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'bacterial community', 'bacterial genome sequencing', 'base', 'cohort', 'dietary', 'disparity reduction', 'genome-wide', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'improved', 'medically underserved', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'response', 'sample collection', 'support vector machine', 'treatment disparity']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,419114
"Anticoagulant use, safety, and effectiveness for venous thromboembolism prevention in inflammatory bowel disease patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a profound need to improve venous thromboembolism [VTE] treatment and prevention, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pharmacoepidemiologist committed to improving VTE prevention and treatment in populations who are often excluded or vastly under-represented in randomized clinical trials [RCTs]. Of the 3 million Americans affected by IBD, ~1–7% will develop VTE, a significant source of morbidity and mortality, in both the outpatient and inpatient settings. While attention has been paid to the role of anticoagulants for VTE prevention in IBD patients, there are key barriers to prescribing anticoagulants in this population including: (1) absence of data on the effectiveness of anticoagulants for the prevention of VTE in IBD patients; (2) fear of bleeding complications; and (3) lack of evidence on the safety of anticoagulants in high-risk subgroups such as patients with active disease flares or postpartum IBD patients, who are at an increased risk of adverse complications. The overarching goal of this research is to evaluate the use, effectiveness, and safety of anticoagulants in IBD patients in the inpatient and outpatient settings. The applicant will achieve the proposed aims of this K99/R00 award under the guidance of established researchers who span the disciplines of epidemiology, biostatistics, gastroenterology, and hematology at the University of Pennsylvania. First, the applicant will use a combination of machine learning and advanced methodological techniques to examine predictors of use, effectiveness, and safety of anticoagulants in the inpatient setting (K99 phase). In the R00 phase, the applicant will use linked electronic health records/claims database to examine the comparative effectiveness and safety of direct oral anticoagulants, warfarin, and heparins in IBD patients in the outpatient setting. The research proposed in this K99/R00 is critical since it provides timely needed information on the risks and benefits of anticoagulants in IBD patients, data that will not be forthcoming from large RCTs in the foreseeable future. The proposed career development and training goals will provide the applicant with training in predictive modeling, time-varying adjustment, and machine learning. The successful completion of the proposed training, infrastructure, and institutional support at the University of Pennsylvania will guarantee the applicant's success and transition to scientific independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of anticoagulants vastly under-represented patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] despite their increased risk of venous thromboembolism [VTE].

"Personalized Rejection Risk Assessment in Cardiac Transplantation Project Summary: Cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) is a serious concern in transplant medicine, representing the leading threat to short- and long-term allograft survival. As a result, CAR surveillance and prevention is a primary focus of post-transplant care, with recipients undergoing frequent, scheduled, surveillance endomyocar- dial biopsy (EMB) for histologic CAR grading along with frequent, scheduled de-escalation of immunosuppres- sion (IS). The uniformity of this standardized approach to CAR mitigation is the result of an inability to employ reliable, proactive, and tailored strategies based on individual CAR risk. Consequently, patients at low CAR risk are exposed to unnecessary EMB procedures and excess IS therapy, while patients at high risk experience inadequate CAR surveillance and early/inappropriate weaning of IS. This exposes patients to potential harm, and highlights the clear, unmet need for precision CAR risk-assessment tools. The overarching premise for this proposal is that contained within the clinical data and EMB tissues already collected as part of usual care at transplant centers exists the means to provide actionable CAR risk assessments. Extensive immunologic, diag- nostic, and pharmacologic data are captured in electronic health records (EHR) at transplant centers, while large collections of EMB histology samples are stored (and often digitized) in pathology archives. This proposal seeks to utilize advanced machine-learning algorithms and in-situ diagnostic methods to deeply mine these archival resources for the purpose of validating novel CAR risk-prediction models. In Aim 1, we will leverage our experi- ence with automated histologic analysis pipelines to develop a ‘morphologic model’ for predicting future CAR using archived H&E slides. Hematoxylin-and-Eosin (H&E) histology slides are generated from all EMB events as part of standard-of-care. In published and patented prior efforts, we have extracted quantitative morphologic features from digitized H&E slides which, when modeled, demonstrate excellent performance for diagnosing myocardial injury and CAR grades. In Aim 2, we will move beyond standard H&E, leveraging our experience with quantitative, in-situ immune-profiling of transplant EMBs to develop a ‘morpho-molecular’ model for predicting future CAR. This aim will expand upon exciting pilot work which showed the CAR risk-stratification potential of combining quantitative image-analysis with multiplex immunofluorescence. Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop a ‘histo-informatics’ model for predicting CAR by integrating data from Aims 1 & 2 with comprehensive clinical informatics data extracted from the EHR. Ultimately, as a result of this work, we expect to validate a novel pre- cision prediction model for use in prospective investigations exploring personalized CAR surveillance and pre- vention strategies. Beyond the potential translational impact, this research plan will build on the Applicant’s knowledge of complex cohort design, integrated data modeling, and transplant immunodiagnostics. Along with planned coursework and a diverse mentoring, advisory, and collaborative team, this proposal provides the opti- mal vehicle for Dr. Peyster’s maturation into an investigator with proven expertise in multi-modality diagnostics. Project Narrative: There is considerable uniformity in the rejection surveillance and prevention protocols used in heart transplant medicine, primarily due to a lack of precision diagnostic tools for assessing individual rejection risk. The inability to provide personalized immunosuppression and biopsy schedules that are tailored to individual risk exposes patients to serious and avoidable opportunistic infections, procedural injuries, and rejection events. This proposal aims to apply advanced informatics, computer-vision, and in-situ diagnostic methods to archived clinical data and biopsy tissues in order to develop a rejection risk-prediction model capable of improving precision in post-transplant care.",Personalized Rejection Risk Assessment in Cardiac Transplantation,10284138,K08HL159344,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Store', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Donor person', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart-Lung Transplantation', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immunodiagnostics', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppression', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Infiltrate', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Protocols', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Schedule', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'allograft rejection', 'analysis pipeline', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'data resource', 'data streams', 'design', 'experience', 'feature extraction', 'heart allograft', 'high risk', 'histological specimens', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'molecular modeling', 'multimodality', 'myocardial injury', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'post-transplant', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'standard of care', 'surveillance strategy', 'tissue archive', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'transplant centers', 'transplantation medicine', 'treatment as usual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,166860
"Clinical Predictors of weekly Rifapentine/isoniazid related adverse drug reactions during national roll-out of tuberculosis preventive therapy Project Summary The WHO approved 3 months weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP) has been found non-inferior to 6H in preventing TB reactivation and achieves higher completion rates. The National TB program in Uganda is currently transitioning from 6HP to 3HP which will be scaled up starting in Jan 2021. Rifapentine has not been widely used in Uganda outside clinical trials and therefore its safety profile in programmatic setting in adults and children is still uncertain. Accurate profiling of patients likely to experience 3HP related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has the potential to improve TPT completion rates, and in turn improve TB control. Our proposal seeks to describe safety profiles of 3HP, completion rates and the clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic determinants of 3HP-related ADRs for people receiving TPT at programmatic level. This study will take place in five health facilities in Uganda in collaboration with the National TB program and the National Drug Authority. We will conduct a cohort study where 614 adults and children >2 years, who have been initiated on 3HP for TPT by the facility clinician according to standard of care will be enrolled. Participants will be both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected. Participants will be followed up monthly for evaluation for ADRs using a standardized questionnaires, clinical evaluation and laboratory tests (liver function testing). For a subset of 300 patients (150 cases who develop grade 2 and above ADRs and 150 controls who do not experience ADRs), we will conduct pharmacokinetic sampling to measure rifapentine and isoniazid concentrations and selected genotyping (for examples N-Acetyl Transferase, Cytochrome 2E1) and Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. We will use pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenetic-pharmacodynamic models and stochastic gradient boosted machine learning together with conventional statistical methods to determine factors associated with ADRs and simple prediction rules for the identification of patients at high risk for ADR. We will also determine the effect of the ADRs on TPT completion rates. Patients will subsequently be followed up for up to 3 years and assessed for TB reactivation according to standard of care to determine the incidence of TB reactivation in patients who have received 3HP and the risk factors for this. This study will provide data on the safety of 3HP during national roll-out and provide information on who is likely to develop ADRs which can affect treatment completion and therefore may benefit from alternative regimens. Study Narrative: This project will describe the clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic determinants of adverse drug reactions among people receiving 3HP for TPT in Uganda. The results of this study will inform clinical decisions for identifying patients at high risk for adverse drug reactions related to 3HP in the African setting.",Clinical Predictors of weekly Rifapentine/isoniazid related adverse drug reactions during national roll-out of tuberculosis preventive therapy,10217331,R01AI160434,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'African', 'Age', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Cytochromes', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exanthema', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Health care facility', 'Hypotension', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Interruption', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Neuropathy', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Questionnaires', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transferase', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'Vision', 'World Health Organization', 'adverse drug reaction', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'authority', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'experience', 'flu', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'human leukocyte antigen testing', 'improved', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'pharmacodynamic model', 'prevent', 'programs', 'reactivation from latency', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'rifapentine', 'scale up', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'uptake']",NIAID,INFECTIOUS DISEASES INSTITUTE,R01,2021,138370
"Optical design and the development of high accuracy automated tick classification using computer vision Abstract. The incidence of US tick-borne diseases has more than doubled in the last two decades. Due to lack of effective vaccines for tick-borne diseases, prevention of tick bites remains the primary focus of disease mitigation. Tick vector surveillance—monitoring an area to understand tick species composition, abundance, and spatial distribution—is key to providing the public with accurate and up-to-date information when they are in areas of high risk, and enabling precision vector control when necessary. Despite the importance of vector surveillance, current practices are highly resource intensive and require significant labor and time to collect and identify vector specimens. Acarologist or field taxonomist expertise is a limited resource required for tick identification, creating a significant capability barrier for national tick surveillance practice. While mobile applications to facilitate passive surveillance and reporting of human-tick encounters have grown in popularity, variable image quality, limited engagement, and scientist misidentification of rare, invasive, or morphologically similar tick species hinder the scalability of this approach. No automated solutions exist to build tick identification capacity. We seek to develop the first imaging and automated identification system capable of instantaneously and accurately identifying the top nine tick vectors in the US. This proposal will first characterize the optical requirements necessary to image diagnostic morphological features associated with adult ticks and develop a standardized imaging platform for tick identification. This will enable the development of a high-quality tick image dataset in partnership with the Walter Reed Biosystems Unit (WRBU) which will be used to train high-accuracy computer vision models for tick species and sex identification. Ultimately the approaches developed here will enable new tick identification tools for both the lab and citizen scientists; allowing vector surveillance managers to leverage image recognition in a practical system that will increase capacity and capability for biosurveillance, and equipping citizen scientists with improved tools to identify tick species during a human-tick encounter. Project Narrative. Despite the importance of tick vector surveillance for disease prevention, current practices to collect and identify specimens are resource intensive, limiting the quality and quantity of the data informing control efforts. Here we propose the determination of optical requirements for visualization of diagnostic features of the top nine US tick vectors, and the development of high-accuracy computer vision algorithms for the identification of tick species and sex for use in a standardized optical configuration.

"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system. The results of this research will provide clinicians, patients and their families with a true understanding of potential side effects of therapies used to treat childhood cancer.",Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials,10229395,K07CA211956,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Acute leukemia', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Child', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncology Group', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'data pipeline', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncology trial', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K07,2021,169884
"Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities Project Summary/Abstract From 2000-2014, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, incidence rates increased nearly 4% per year, while most cancers in the United States were on the decline. HCC disproportionately impacts minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. To inform primary prevention strategies that will reduce disparities in HCC risk, we need to determine the relative contribution of well- established and emerging (e.g., hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, alcohol, smoking, cirrhosis, NAFLD, metabolic disorders, diabetes, HIV infection), and novel (e.g., medications, comorbidities, neighborhood attributes) risk factors to these disparities. To inform secondary and tertiary prevention strategies to reduce disparities in HCC burden, we need to understand the multilevel factors that contribute to HCC surveillance disparities. Answering these gaps in knowledge requires a robust high-quality study with a sample enriched for racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, we propose to leverage existing multi-disciplinary collaborations to develop an integrated dataset that includes electronic health records (EHR) data linked to population-based state cancer registry data and geospatial contextual data. This multilevel resource will include data on nearly 2.3 million individuals from three healthcare systems (mixed payer, integrated healthcare, federally qualified health centers) in California and Hawaii, thus providing diversity in healthcare settings and enrichment for racial/ethnic minorities: 59,400 are Black, 189,500 are Hispanic, and 441,700 are Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI). With this resource, we specifically aim to: (1) assess the relative importance of established and emerging examine the extent to which these factors independently and jointly contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk; (2) discover novel risk factors and assess their relative importance to HCC risk; and (3) assess racial/ethnic disparities in adherence with surveillance for HCC as well as examine the extent to which these disparities are attributable to modifiable individual-, clinician-, system-, and neighborhood factors (Aim 3). For Aim 1, using prospective data, we will assess the relative importance of risk factors and their contribution to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk with causal inference methods. For Aim 2, we will apply innovative machine learning methods to identify novel factors and validate their associations with HCC risk using modeling strategy from Aim 1. For Aim 3, we will use multilevel generalized linear regression to investigate the patient, clinician, institutional and geographic factors that contribute to disparities in HCC surveillance. Given the importance of sex and age/birth cohort for HCC risk, these social determinants will be considered together with race/ethnicity using an intersectional approach. By applying a multilevel framework to understand how biological, clinical, and social factors at multiple levels contribute to HCC disparities in incidence and surveillance, the proposed study will identify modifiable factors that can be translated to the clinical and community settings to collaboratively identify strategies to ameliorate racial/ethnic disparities in HCC. Project Narrative While most cancer incidence and mortality in the United States are declining, the burden of liver cancer is increasing; yet, we do not understand what causes 40% of these cancers. Furthermore, this cancer impacts racial/ethnic groups disproportionately, with minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. Therefore we propose to study the relative contribution of established and emerging risk factors, discover and validate novel risk factors, and to understand patient, clinician, healthcare system and geographic factors that influence surveillance; these findings can then be used to inform strategies in clinical and community settings to reduce the burden of liver cancer particularly for those at high risk.",Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities,10215436,R01CA225478,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Alcohols', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'HIV Infections', 'Hawaii', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Prevention', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'built environment', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer health disparity', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'comorbidity', 'data registry', 'disparity reduction', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'sex', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social disparities', 'social factors', 'socioeconomics', 'tertiary prevention']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,640962
"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,10151599,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human Characteristics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling Biases', 'Self Administration', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'hormone therapy', 'human subject', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'patient engagement', 'patient portal', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'side effect', 'social cognitive theory', 'text searching', 'treatment adherence', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2021,386906
"Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section This UG3/UH3 proposal titled “Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance” is in response to Research Area 1 of PAR 16-349 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-16-349.html) specifically addressing the development of natural language processing (NLP) tools to facilitate automatic/unsupervised/minimally supervised extraction of specific discrete cancer-related data from various types of unstructured electronic medical records (EMRs) related to the activities of cancer registries. It is submitted through a multi-PI mechanism – Prof. Guergana Savova from Boston Children’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Dr. Jeremy Warner from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Prof. Harry Hochheiser from the University of Pittsburgh, and Prof. Eric Durbin from the Kentucky Cancer Registry/University of Kentucky. The current proposal builds on prior work funded by the NCI Informatics Tools for Cancer Research (ITCR) program (https://itcr.cancer.gov/ ). We envision building on our work to date to advance methods for information extraction of clinical phenotyping data needed to fuel a new cancer surveillance paradigm that would benefit hospital-based, state-based, and national cancer registries. In this new paradigm, surveillance programs would use the methods to enhance the speed, accuracy, and ease of cancer reporting. The proposed DeepPhe*CR platform could be deployed at local sites or centrally, and could eventually be integrated into existing or new visualization and abstraction tools as needed by the cancer surveillance community. Although there has been some previous work on automatic phenotype extraction from the various streams of data including the clinical narrative for specific types of cancer or individual variables for cancer surveillance, the proposed work will be a step towards a generalizable information extraction. This generalizability enables extensibility and scalability. Interoperability is reinforced through the modeling part of the proposed project which is grounded in most recent advances in biomedical ontologies, terminologies, community-adopted conventions and standards. Our planned partnership with three SEER cancer registries provides our decision-making processes with a solid foundation in large-scale cancer surveillance. n/a",Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance,10441803,UH3CA243120,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Area', 'Boston', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Kentucky', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Surveillance Program', 'Terminology', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'cancer type', 'clinical phenotype', 'data streams', 'informatics tool', 'interoperability', 'medical schools', 'neoplasm registry', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool']",NCI,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,UH3,2021,660155
"A precision medicine approach to improve prediction of severe toxicity in fluorouracil chemotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My long-term goal is to improve the toxicity profiles for cancer therapeutics. One-third of cancer patients treated with the commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) experience severe and life- threatening toxicity to standard doses of the drug. An appreciable fraction of those patients die—not due to cancer, but because of side-effects related to treatment. Clinical studies indicate that the majority of patients who experience severe toxicity to 5-FU are deficient for an enzyme called dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, DPYD gene); however, only four genetic variants in DPYD have been adequately characterized to be considered predictive of 5-FU toxicity in clinical studies. My preliminary studies demonstrate that these four variants explain only a small fraction of severe 5-FU toxicities and have exceedingly limited clinical value outside of individuals with European ancestry. The primary objective of the studies proposed in this grant application is to identify additional biomarkers of 5-FU toxicity risk that can be used to individualize 5-FU dosing with the goal of improving the safety profile for the drug. My overall hypothesis is that expanded biomarker-based pre-treatment tests will more accurately identify patients with DPD deficiency, as well as the relative degree to which the DPD function is impaired, enabling more accurate dose optimization. My rationale is that improved biomarker-based approaches to dose individualization have strong potential to improve the safety profile for this commonly used therapeutic. Aim #1 will identify risk alleles for severe 5-FU–related toxicity in understudied populations. Aim #2 will characterize multi-marker haplotype contributions to 5-FU toxicity. In Aim #3, I will develop an integrated predictive model of 5-FU toxicity using deep machine learning. It is my expectation that the proposed studies, which will leverage multiple large patient and volunteer data and specimen collections to address various aspects of my primary hypothesis, will answer key questions that have vexed pharmacogenetics researchers for decades. In doing so, the proposed studies are expected to identify clinically relevant biomarkers that can be used to improve the safety profile of 5-FU through dose optimization. PROJECT NARRATIVE Improved predictive tests for 5-FU toxicity risk, coupled with a clear indication of the clinical validity of such tests, is relevant to public health because it is expected to reduce the number and severity of adverse drug reactions, improve treatment efficacy, and lower the overall financial burden for cancers treated with 5-FU. Collectively, this is expected to optimize longer-term systemic therapy and minimize toxicity with an overall improvement in quality of life for cancer patients.",A precision medicine approach to improve prediction of severe toxicity in fluorouracil chemotherapy,10295231,R01CA251065,"['Address', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Coupled', 'DPYD gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase', 'Dose', 'Enzymes', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Financial Hardship', 'Fluorouracil', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Haplotypes', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Variant', 'Western Europe', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'dose individualization', 'expectation', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medication safety', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'side effect', 'volunteer']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,363713
