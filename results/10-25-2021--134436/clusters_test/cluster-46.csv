"The plasticity of well-being:  A research network to define, measure and promote human flourishing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This U24 application is written in response to RFA-AT-20-003 to establish a high-priority research network on emotional well-being (EWB). While psychological research on well-being has dramatically increased over the past 15 years, virtually all of this work has been descriptive and has not emphasized the “how” of well-being: How might well-being be cultivated? In addition, virtually all of the extant work on the correlates of individual differences in well-being has used responses on retrospective questionnaires as the primary tool to assess well-being. While there have been exciting findings, particularly relating individual differences in well-being to various indices of physical health, many questions remain and methodological limitations plague the validity of this work. This U24 network will assemble a highly multi-disciplinary group of 10 investigators across 3 (or more in the future) institutions to significantly advance our understanding of the “how” of EWB, identify the core plastic constituents of EWB, specify and/or develop robust measures of these constituents at biological, behavioral and experiential levels of analysis and characterize the plasticity of these constituents. The measurement strategy will ultimately focus on the development of technology-based passive measures of EWB that require no explicit user input and are highly scalable. The network will also focus its efforts on the development and evaluation of programs to train EWB and will assess whether such programs might serve as prevention strategies. The network will consist of scientists and scholars from a broad range of fields including psychology, neuroscience, electrical and computer engineering, population health and biology, computer science and the humanities. These scientists and scholars will focus on the following major aims: Aim 1: To arrive at a core consensus of the minimal set of constituents that can be described and measured at biological, behavioral and experiential levels that constitute the plastic elements of EWB and to specify already existing measures and /or develop novel measures of each of these constructs at each level of analysis. Aim 2: Using the active measures described in Aim 1, to develop passive measures using digital technologies of at least two of the core constituents of well-being. Aim 3: To develop pilot projects specifically focusing on prevention strategies for learning well-being in various samples. The network will train new investigators and bring established investigators into this new field, disseminate a framework for understanding the plasticity of well- being, a toolbox of measures for assessing the plasticity of components of well-being, and several pilot datasets that showcase the novel passive and field-friendly biological measures. In these ways, the network will dramatically accelerate progress in the nascent field of EWB. PROJECT NARRATIVE This U24 network on emotional well-being (EWB) will catalyze the emerging field of the plasticity of well-being and will showcase how well-being can be learned and the consequences of such skill development on physical and emotional health and on prevention of disease. A framework for understanding how well-being can be learned along with measures of the core components of well-being that can be learned will be developed and disseminated. The network will also train new investigators in this area and will engage established investigators to contribute to this field.","The plasticity of well-being:  A research network to define, measure and promote human flourishing",10151850,U24AT011289,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Cellular Phone', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Drug abuse', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Humanities', 'Individual Differences', 'Institution', 'Interruption', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Population Biology', 'Prevention strategy', 'Program Evaluation', 'Psychology', 'Publications', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Well in self', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mindfulness meditation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'skill acquisition', 'social', 'standard measure', 'technology development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web site']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U24,2021,30000
"Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY This application is for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington and affiliated institutions. This Center has over the past 25 years provided key resources in support of investigators who study the biology of aging. This application continues a theme that emphasizes outreach and service to the broadest community of investigators in the gerosciences. Of proximal relevance is the characterization of aging-related phenotypes of longevity and healthspan. As our Center services must be easily accessible to outside users, our Longevity and Healthspan Core (Core E) focuses on invertebrate assays, many of them novel. Two other Resources Cores focus on the high dimensional assessments that are closely related to aging phenotypes: Protein Phenotypes of Aging (Core C) and Metabolite Phenotypes of Aging (Core D). Sophisticated computational and bioinformatic tools for data analysis and optimal insight are provided by the Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Core F. Each of these four Resource Cores is led by highly respected experts in that field, including Michael MacCoss and Judit Villen (Core C), Daniel Promislow (Core D), Matt Kaeberlein and Maitreya Dunham (Core E) and Su-In Lee (Core F). Each will push the envelope of appropriate technologies, developing new state-of-the art approaches for assessments that are the most applicable to gerontology and making them accessible to the national aging community. The Research Development Core (Core B) will continue to support pilot and junior faculty studies, with a firm focus on outreach of service to the national geroscience constituency. The Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, courses, and data sharing and dissemination. Core A’s program of seminars and symposia will continue a focus on sponsorship and organization of national courses, meetings and pre-meetings, as well as workshops in the fields allied to our Resource Core Services. In coordination with other Nathan Shock Centers, we will support a new Geropathology Research initiative. UW NATHAN SHOCK CENTER OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We apply for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington, which has for 25 years provided key resources supporting investigators who study the biology of aging. The overarching goal of this Center is to have a positive impact on the field by accelerating research discovery and providing research support for investigators nationally and internationally, particularly junior investigators in the process of building their own research programs. We will accomplish this goal through six cores that function synergistically together: four Resource Cores with particular expertise in protein (Core C) and metabolite (Core D) phenotypes of aging, invertebrate longevity and healthspan phenotypes (Core E) and artificial intelligence and bioinformatics (Core F), along with a Research Development Core (Core B) that supports external pilot projects and junior faculty studies, and an Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) that supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, sponsorship and organization of national meetings and pre-meetings, courses, workshops and seminars, and, in coordination with other Nathan Shock Centers, a Geropathology Research initiative.",Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging,10260476,P30AG013280,"['Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology of Aging', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Faculty', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Gerontology', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Office of Administrative Management', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Philosophy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'bioinformatics tool', 'career development', 'cell age', 'computerized tools', 'data dissemination', 'data sharing', 'healthspan', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'outreach', 'outreach services', 'programs', 'protein metabolite', 'research and development', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P30,2021,962037
"Next-generation clinical phenotyping and pathophysiology of laryngeal dystonia and voice tremor PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Laryngeal dystonia (LD) and voice tremor (VT) are hyperkinetic neurological disorders that significantly impair voice and speech production and negatively impact the patient’s quality of life, extending beyond speech motor alterations and often causing occupational disability and life-long social isolation. The standards of clinical care of LD and VT are not established; that is, the differential diagnostic criteria remain vague, leading to a high rate of misdiagnosis, whereas treatment is largely limited to temporary symptom management with botulinum toxin injections into the affected laryngeal muscles. One of the major causes of suboptimal clinical care of these patients is the limited understanding of their distinct clinical characteristics and neural pathophysiology. We propose a multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary Center research program that will focus on the delineation of unique clinical and pathophysiological features of LD and VT in order to establish the fundamental framework for the enhanced clinical management of these disorders, including their accurate diagnosis and disorder-specific therapies. The Center research goals will be accomplished through collaborative clinical research studies at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Massachusetts General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, and University of Utah, which will include three Center Projects, a Scientific Core that incorporates the Clinical Research and Data Science components, and an Administrative Core that provides an overall organizational infrastructure to the Center activities. The overall Specific Aims of this Center will be (1) Characterization of clinical phenotypes of LD and VT; (2) Understanding disorder-specific neural pathophysiology in LD and VT; (3) Deep brain stimulation in LD and VT, and (4) Machine-learning platforms for differential diagnosis of LD and VT. We expect that our cross-disciplinary and collaborative Center, encompassing the expertise in otolaryngology, speech-language pathology, neurology, neurosurgery, brain and larynx imaging, invasive neurophysiology, and clinical neuroscience and applying complementary multimodal methodologies across these fields, will have a significant positive impact on developing new knowledge about the links between symptomatology and pathophysiology of LD and VT, which will help define the new standards of enhanced clinical care of these disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall goals of this Center are to (1) identify integrated features of clinical, behavioral and neural characteristics that reflect overlapping and distinct pathophysiology of laryngeal dystonia and voice tremor, and (2) develop predictive analytics for differential diagnosis of these disorders. This research is relevant to public health because it is expected to advance the understanding of the disorder pathophysiology and help define new approaches for their clinical management. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burdens of human disability.",Next-generation clinical phenotyping and pathophysiology of laryngeal dystonia and voice tremor,10340118,P50DC019900,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavioral', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dystonia', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Essential Tremor', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Infrastructure', 'Injections', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Otolaryngology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Speech-Language Pathology', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'early detection biomarkers', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'symptom management', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,P50,2021,2478460

"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis.

"Carolina Population Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Carolina Population Center requests infrastructure support that will advance population dynamics research at CPC by increasing research impact, innovation, and productivity, supporting the development of junior scientists, and reducing the administrative burden on scientists. Infrastructure support will advance science in three primary research areas: Sexuality, Reproduction, Fertility, and Families; Population, Health, and the Environment; and Inequality, Mobility, Disparities, and Well-Being. Much of the research at CPC draws on large publicly available longitudinal data sets that our faculty have designed and collected, including the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the China Health and Nutrition Survey, newer surveys associated with the Transfer Project, and the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, all of which will continue to be important in work related to our primary research areas over the next five years. These projects embody several themes that have guided research at CPC since the Center's inception. These themes, which will continue to shape our work, are the importance of life course processes and longitudinal data, multi-level processes and measurement of context, interventions and natural experiments as means of learning about causal processes, and the relevance of sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, race- ethnicity, and socioeconomic status for disparities in health and well-being. By embedding these themes, our projects provide data that enable us to address barriers that otherwise impede progress in the population sciences generally, and in our primary research areas in particular. We request support for three cores which in combination will provide an institutional infrastructure that will push populations dynamics research forward by empowering CPC faculty to tackle challenging questions using state of the art measurement techniques and methods. The Administrative Core plans activities that maintain a stimulating intellectual community, streamlines administrative processes so that scientists can focus on research, coordinates activities of the Cores so that services are offered efficiently, and communicates information about research and data more broadly. The Development Core supports early stage investigators and other faculty with exciting new ideas through multiple mechanisms: workshops, access to technical expertise in measurement, and seed grants. The Research Services Core enables scientists to address complex and important population research issues by providing access to state-of-the-art research tools and professional support for programming, survey development, and analysis. NARRATIVE This project will provide infrastructure support for a cutting edge program of research on population dynamics at the Carolina Population Center.

"Michigan Integrative Musculoskeletal Health Core Center (Overall Application) Michigan Integrative Musculoskeletal Health Core Center - Overview Project Summary Musculoskeletal disorders remain an enormous public healthcare problem, accounting for more than fifty percent of chronic conditions in developed countries. The current financial landscape not only challenges investigator- led scientific programs, but particularly threatens collaborative research because lack of flexibility in individual budgets restricts resources and ability to share valuable techniques with our scientific neighbors. The Michigan Integrative Musculoskeletal Health Core Center (MiMHC) enables vertically integrated, multi-scale musculoskeletal science from molecular and omic-level mechanisms to organismal function and clinical outcomes by increasing access to critical, specialized resources and expertise that are fundamental to the musculoskeletal research programs of 90 Center investigators. The MiMHC is structured to be consistent with initiatives at the University of Michigan aimed at promoting collaborations across disciplines and between basic scientists and clinicians to promote health by better understanding disease and injury mechanisms. The MiMHC not only enhances the capabilities of a group of outstanding musculoskeletal researchers but also leverages their collective talent through an Enrichment Program that promotes novel and emerging musculoskeletal research in cross-tissue interactions and sex-specific differences throughout the life course. An outreach program creates a rich community of musculoskeletal scientists through a novel monthly seminar series that builds on existing momentum toward accelerating discussion, critical thinking, research rigor and reproducibility, and innovation. To accomplish these goals, an Administrative Core will oversee core operations and three Resource Cores to provide Structure, Composition, and Histology services, Functional assessment services, and Integrative Data Analytics services to all members of the MiMHC research community. The Resource Cores are structured to facilitate hierarchically mechanistic studies from the molecular and omic-levels through the organ-level and to the clinical setting. Access to the Resource Cores has been and will continue to be financially and scientifically impactful to Center investigators by centralizing core technologies and by providing access to Core Directors who are experts in their field and who will provide guidance on the best choice of technologies, experimental design, and data interpretation. The UM environment is ideal for continuing to build a strong research community and to sustain an innovative, collaborative venture aimed at advancing understanding of musculoskeletal health and disease and to conduct science highly relevant to the NIAMS mission.

We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,10259872,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug repurposing', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'efficacious treatment', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2021,1308288
"Boston University CCCR OVERALL ABSTRACT The Boston University CCCR will serve as a central resource for clinical research focused mostly on the most common musculoskeletal disorders, osteoarthritis and gout and will also provide research resources for investigator based research in scleroderma, spondyloarthritis, musculoskeletal pain and osteoporosis. Center grant funding has supported 30-35 papers annually in peer reviewed journals, most in the leading arthritis journals and some in leading general medical journals. This center has trained many of the leading clinical researchers in rheumatology throughout the US and internationally, and many of these former trainees have active collaborations with the center. We will include a broad research community and a core group of faculty in this CCCR. The research community's ready access to core faculty and to the sophisticated research methods and assistance they provide will enhance the clinical and translational research of the community and will increase collaborative opportunities for the core faculty and the community. The CCCR updates BU's historical focus on epidemiologic methods to include new approaches to causal inference and adds new methods in machine learning and mobile health. The Research and Evaluation Support Core Unit (RESCU) is the focal point of this CCCR. A key feature is the weekly research (RESCU meetings in which ongoing and proposed research projects are critically evaluated. This feature ensures frequent interactions between clinician researchers, epidemiologists and biostatisticians who are the core members of the CCCR. The RESCU core unit has provided critical support for other Center grants related to rheumatic and arthritic disorders at Boston University, three current R01/U01's; five current NIH K awards (one K24, 3 K23's, one K01), an R03, an NIH trial planning grant (U34), and multiple ACR RRF awards. The overall goal of this center is to carry out and disseminate high-level clinical research informed both by state of the art clinical research methods and by clinical and biological scientific discoveries.

"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models. These scientific themes will be approached through several Cores described in the following Specific Aims. 1. To strategically direct, supervise, and provide financial accountability to VERITY and to train a broad group of local and national investigators for patient-oriented clinical research in pediatric and adult rheumatic and MSK diseases. (Administrative Core) 2. To develop and implement state of the art methods in innovative trials and longitudinal comparative effectiveness studies for rheumatic and MSK disease research.

"Penn Artificial Intelligence and Technology Collaboratory for Healthy Aging The overarching goal of our proposed Penn Artificial Intelligence and Technology (PennAITech) Collaboratory is to identify, develop, evaluate, commercialize, and disseminate innovative technology for monitoring aging adults and those with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) in their home environment and the artificial intelligence (AI) methods and software for analyzing data generated by those technologies. The collaboratory is motivated by the need for a comprehensive pipeline from technology-based monitoring of aging adults in the home, collection and processing monitoring data, integration of those data with clinical data from electronic health records, analysis with cutting-edge AI methods and software, and deployment of validated AI models at point of care for decision support. We have assembled a team of experts with experience building and implementing each component of this pipeline and will promote this vision and existing tools and software (AIM 1). A central focus of the PennAITech Collaboratory is to advance this vision through the solicitation, review, and funding of pilot grants focused on technology and AI development to advance the science of care management and aging in place for vulnerable older adults or those with AD/ADRD receiving skilled home and community-based services (AIM 2). Funded pilot projects will be supported in AIM 3 through cores focused on administration (Core A), stakeholder engagement (Core B), technology identification and training (Core C), clinical translation and validation (Core D), networking (Core E), and ethical and policy issues (Core H). Finally, the collaboratory will work closely with the planned coordinating center to facilitate the success and translation of all collaboratory projects (AIM 4). We are committed to improving the health of aging adults and those with AD/ADRD through these specific aims. Successful aging in the home can greatly improve quality of life, improve health outcomes, and reduce burden on the healthcare system.

"The Duke Senescent Cell Evaluations in Normal Tissues (SCENT) Mapping Center ABSTRACT –SCENT– Overall Cellular senescence is a stress-response, as well as a critical component of cell fate during development, repair, resilience and normal aging. Deepening and broadening our investigations into cellular senescence in normal condition will advance our knowledge of healthy aging as well as age-related disabilities, thereby leading to integrated and inclusive approaches to Gero-Protection and Gero-Therapeutics. A comprehensive, high- resolution, Atlas of cellular senescence in various human tissues based on multimodal and multidimensional analyses is required to address this need. The Duke Senescent Cell Evaluations in Normal Tissues (SCENT) U54 Tissue Mapping Center (TMC) will leverage the broad and world-leading expertise of Duke University School of Medicine faculty to contribute to the overall goal of mapping senescent cells at single cell resolution in normal human tissues of across age-span and demographics. We will take advantage of Duke's broad expertise in many areas, including pulmonary critical care, lung and heart transplant surgery, translational research, and bioinformatics, to collect high-quality normal tissue specimens for biobanking, multimodal, high-resolution analysis, and data integration to fully characterize cellular senescence in human organs and tissues. The Duke SCENT TMC will be organized around 4 Cores as required by SenNet: The Administrative Core (AC) of this TCM will provide guidance and leadership to the other cores and communicate with NIH Staff and the SenNet Consortium during the set-up phase to agree on common protocols. The Biospecimen Core will establish best practices for prospective acquisition, preservation and processing of diverse, high-quality normal healthy human tissues and associated biofluids. The Biological Analysis Core will deliver state-of-the-art profiling, led by a team of highly accomplished research scientists who have successfully utilized these specific platforms in conjunction with previous and/or current senescent analyses. The Data Analysis Core (DAC) will manage, process and analyze the data generated to profile senescent cell signatures and construct senescent cell tissue maps, as well as collaborate with the Administrative Core to coordinate sharing of data, methods and pipelines with other SenNet institutions. Narrative – Overall: Senescent Cell Evaluation in Normal Tissues Senescence is a critical part of aging but remains poorly understood.

"CORE CENTER FOR CLINICAL RESEACH IN TOTAL JOINT ARTHROPLASTY (CORE-TJA) ABSTRACT - OVERALL Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgery in the nation. There are currently more than 7 million Americans living with artificial joints. Despite the high surgery volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures, technologies and associated interventions are limited. Many surgical approaches and implant technologies in TJA are adopted based on theoretical grounds with limited clinical evidence. The wider TJA research community needs access to large, high quality and rich data sources and state-of-the-art clinical research standards and information technologies to overcome methodological and practical challenges in studies of surgical and nonsurgical interventions in TJA. The overarching goal of Mayo Core Center for Clinical Research in Total Joint Arthroplasty (CORE-TJA) is to facilitate innovative, methodologically rigorous and interdisciplinary clinical research that will directly improve TJA care and the outcomes. The CORE-TJA will serve as a disease (TJA) and theme-focused Center providing shared methodological expertise, education and data resources. The CORE-TJA will leverage big data resources for TJA research, provide customized methodology resources in epidemiology, biostatistics, health services research and medical informatics, and establish synergistic interactions around an integrated Core (American Joint Replacement Registry – AJRR). The Specific Aims of CORE-TJA are: (1) To provide administrative and scientific oversight of CORE-TJA activities (Administrative Core), (2) To provide integrated services, access to large databases and novel analytical methods for clinical research in TJA (Methodology Core); and (3) To meet the unique data needs of the TJA research community and to strengthen the national capacity for large-scale observational and interventional studies in TJA using national registry data (Resource Core). The CORE-TJA will be integrated within the long-standing and highly centralized clinical research environment of the Mayo Clinic, thereby leveraging existing expertise and infrastructure resources, including the Center for Clinical and Translational Science. All CORE-TJA activities will be evaluated using robust metrics to ensure continuous evaluation, flexibility and improvement in response to the most pressing needs of the TJA research community.

"Center for Modeling Complex Interactions Biomedical problems are innately complex, and their solutions require input from many fields. Many centers focus on a single disease or organ system. By contrast, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions focuses on an approach that can address many biomedical problems: team-based, interdisciplinary research centered around modeling. Our goal is to support and facilitate biomedical discovery by integrating modeling into interdisciplinary research. Modeling improves research at all stages—hypothesis formulation, experimental design, analysis, and interpretation. It provides a unifying language by which exchange of ideas can highlight commonalities and uncover unforeseen connections between problems. Formalization of ideas into this unifying language also improves rigor and reproducibility. We define modeling broadly to include everything from deterministic and stochastic mathematical approaches, to physical and computational models of three- dimensional objects, to agent-based and machine learning approaches where exact solutions are not possible. We seek to support modelers by increasing their numbers, and by giving them opportunities to play on interdisciplinary teams. We seek to support empiricists by giving them access to relevant modeling expertise, and by creating a community and a culture to facilitate interdisciplinary research. In Phase I, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions created the intellectual, cultural, and physical environment to promote team- based, interdisciplinary research. In Phase II, we will build on that foundation by maintaining a strong interdisciplinary culture to foster collaboration among people who might otherwise never connect, and by adding additional faculty to expand our modeling expertise. We have four Aims: 1) Support faculty to carry out model-based, interdisciplinary biomedical research and increase their competitiveness for external funding. Research in the Center is carried out in the context of Working Groups—zero-barrier, interdisciplinary, goal- focused teams that meet regularly to get work done. Supported research includes three Research Projects, Pilot Projects, Modeling Access Grants, and ad hoc teams. Our comprehensive plan for proposal preparation improves grantsmanship, and our staff assists with submission and grant management. 2) Increase University of Idaho’s faculty participation in biomedical research. We will add six new faculty as a commitment to this Phase II COBRE and attract broader participation from across the University. 3) Extend the reach of the Modeling Core into new areas of modeling to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The Modeling Core accelerates interdisciplinary research by placing Core Fellows at the hub of the research community. We have added new Core Initiatives in machine learning and geospatial modeling to stimulate research in these areas with high potential for future growth. 4) Establish a path to long-term sustainability under the umbrella of the Institute for Modeling Collaboration & Innovation. The major hurdle for sustainability is to maintain a robust Modeling Core. We have developed a business plan that calls for us to diversify our funding sources to include institutional, state, and private support to supplement federal grants. Human health is determined by interactions of complex biological systems at multiple scales, from the ecological to the biophysical; these are layered with spatial and temporal variation. To decipher these systems requires predictive modeling, coupled with strong empirical work, to be guided by and to feed the models. The Center for Modeling Complex Interactions generates model-based biomedical research and connects people who might otherwise never interact, which enhances the strong interdisciplinary culture of the University of Idaho.",Center for Modeling Complex Interactions,10220054,P20GM104420,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysics', 'Businesses', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Designs', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Holly', 'Home', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Idaho', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Physical environment', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Privatization', 'Progress Reports', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'body system', 'complex biological systems', 'experience', 'faculty support', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mathematical methods', 'member', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'spatial temporal variation', 'success', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'undergraduate student', 'working group']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,P20,2021,2194934

We propose to provide core support to 69 research projects headed by 44 PIs addressing three broad themes relevant to IDD: 1) neurodevelopment and mechanisms, 2) disorders of the nervous system, and 3) assessments and interventions. Collectively the core services and the research project of the Waisman Center IDDRC will stimulate new interdisciplinary IDD research and enhance existing IDD investigations, with a sharp focus on discovery, prevention, and treatment for IDD conditions, and improvement of the quality of life of individuals with IDD and their families. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the Waisman Center IDDRC at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is to promote the highest level of IDD research by providing access to cutting-edge and cost-effective core services, seminars, and pre- and post-doctoral training, via a comprehensive program designed to produce a transformative understanding of IDD pathology, development of new interventions, and training the next generation of basic and clinical IDD researchers.",Waisman Center Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center,10239776,P50HD105353,"['Address', 'Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Ecology', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genomics', 'Health Services Research', 'Home', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language Disorders', 'Letters', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mouse Strains', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurosciences', 'Nursery Schools', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Privatization', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rattus', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Series', 'Services', 'Social Work', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Veterinary Medicine', 'Wisconsin', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'biobehavior', 'collaborative approach', 'college', 'community clinic', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'leadership development', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'method development', 'microPET', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'post-doctoral training', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'recruit', 'science education', 'special interest group', 'stem cells', 'training opportunity', 'translational research program', 'treatment services', 'undergraduate student']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,P50,2021,350000
"Phase III COBRE:  Multimodal Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders (MIND) Project Summary/Abstract  This Phase III (P-III) COBRE project will extend the cores that have been successfully leveraged in our Phase I (P-I) and Phase II (P-II) COBRE projects and sustain these unique resources in New Mexico through the im- plementation of a business plan. Over the past eight years we have built up infrastructure and created a cutting edge brain imaging center, our P-II project is just over half-way through and is even more successful than our P- I was at this point in time. The Mind Research Network (MRN) houses an Elekta Neuromag 306-channel MEG System, a high density EEG lab, a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner, and a mobile 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner. Additional resources include a centralized neuroinformatics system, a strong IT management plan, and state-of-the-art image analysis expertise and tools. This P-III COBRE center will continue our momentum and move the cores we have developed into a position of long term sustainability. We will continue with the technical cores established during the P-II project including multimodal data acquisition (MDA), algorithm and data analy- sis (ADA), and biostatistics and neuro-informatics (BNI). These cores have begun to serve MRN and the greater community, as well as other institutions including extensive collaborations with IDeA funded projects in New Mexico and other states. We believe this P-III COBRE is extremely well-positioned to establish and sustain New Mexico as one of the premier brain imaging sites. We include an extensive pilot project program (PPP) that is built on the successful pilot programs implemented as part of the earlier COBRE phases. This includes an ex- tensive educational, mentoring, and faculty development program to carefully mentor and position faculty who use the cores to maximize their potential to successfully compete for external funding, thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the COBRE program. 2 Narrative  This Phase III COBRE project is a natural extension of our Phase I and II COBRE projects which were cen- tered on mentoring individual researchers along with building the necessary infrastructure to support multimodal neuroimaging in mental illness. During this time, cutting-edge cores were developed that facilitated not only our local projects but also research at multiple institutions across New Mexico; the cores served as neuroimaging facilities and training centers for others to utilize. The Phase III project will ensure the sustainability of these cores as they transition to being fully funded by a broad cadre of users with various funding sources. We propose three technical cores including a multimodal data acquisition (MDA) core, an algorithm and data analysis (ADA) core, and a biostatistics and neuro-informatics (BNI) core. These cores have already shown their utility and have begun to be leveraged by users outside the COBRE. In addition, we propose a robust pilot project program (PPP) to continue to seed and enable new users of the cores to ultimately grow and sustain world class brain imaging research within our IDeA state, thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the COBRE program. 1",Phase III COBRE:  Multimodal Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders (MIND),10372242,P30GM122734,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Mission', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'New Mexico', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Seeds', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'distinguished professor', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'meetings', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'programs', 'tool']",NIGMS,LOVELACE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,P30,2021,373857

"Discovery Science Collaborative for CKDu PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Discovery Science Collaborative for CKDu Renal Science Core is to bring the best investigative methods and scientific technology to the problem of CKDu. We will work closely with Field Epidemiology Sites, the Scientific Data Coordinating Center, NIDDK Leadership, the External Oversight Committee, and HHEAR to design clinical phenotyping studies and perform discovery science experiments. We will then integrate this data to elucidate the etiology and progression factors of CKDu occurring in diverse agricultural communities. The Renal Science Core is a multi-institutional collaborative organized around six Core components: Genomics, Pathology, Transcriptomics, Biomarkers, Physiology, and Bioinformatics. The specific aims of the RSC are to: (1) characterize the clinical phenotypes and natural history of patients with CKDu and unaffected individuals in CKDu-endemic regions, comparing features across CKDu sites and determining the degree of similarities and differences across sites and regions; (2) introduce cutting-edge molecular technologies to compare the risk factors and pathophysiology of CKDu across and within study sites to understand both shared and unique aspects of the etiology of disease; (3) define the relationship between AKI and CKDu in endemic regions; and (4) build a flexible, adaptable infrastructure for both hypothesis- and non-hypothesis-based approaches to understanding etiology that will form the core of ongoing CKDu studies. The leadership team of the RSC has extensive experience working on CKDu, a history of collaboration on international working groups, and leadership roles on other major NIDDK consortia. This group brings together expertise in nephrology, genomics, nephropathology, machine learning algorithms for digital pathology, single- cell transcriptomics, biomarker development, proteomics, metabolomics, renal physiology, bioinformatics, and data integration. We have also enlisted several advisors with expertise in novel pathogen discovery, novel imaging technologies, and environmental sampling. These studies will result in a greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of CKDu. Project Narrative The Discovery Science Collaborative for CKDu is a multi-PI application for the Renal Science Core for the Chronic Kidney Diseases of UnceRtain Etiology (CKDu) in Agricultural Communities (CURE) Research Consortium. The Renal Science Core consists of several Core components: Genomics, Pathology, Transcriptomics, Biomarker / Proteomics, Physiology, and Bioinformatics / Data Integration. The RSC team is uniquely poised to work within an NIDDK infrastructure with Field Epidemiology Sites, the Scientific Data Coordinating Center, NIDDK leadership, HHEAR, and the External Oversight Committee to make significant contributions to the CURE Consortium in discovery science and achieve the long-term goal of elucidating the etiology, progression, and heterogeneity of CKDu in agricultural communities.",Discovery Science Collaborative for CKDu,10300877,U01DK130060,"['Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Agricultural Workers', 'Agrochemicals', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cells', 'Central America', 'Central Asia', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Databases', 'Developing Countries', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrolytes', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Far East', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Infiltrate', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'International', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Leadership', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural History', 'Nephrology', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Serum', 'Site', 'South America', 'Sri Lanka', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'agricultural community', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'case control', 'clinical phenotype', 'community based participatory research', 'comorbidity', 'data integration', 'design', 'digital pathology', 'emerging pathogen', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'kidney biopsy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'molecular pathology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel imaging technology', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'single cell sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'urinary', 'working group']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,439686
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including serious viral pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with serious viral or Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter bacterial pneumonias. Both of these CDC-designated serious hazard level bacterial pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host response. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome and the differential microbiome response. Specific pathogen genomic profiles identified will be tested for causality in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model by the Technology Core. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. A Technical Core will perform cell sorting of BAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, as well as perform the mouse pneumonia model studies. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use an ecosystem-based approach to this complex adaptive system combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. Biomarkers will also be tested for causality the mouse model. The Administrative Core will perform the outward- facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"Methods for Evolutionary Genomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY This administrative supplement request aims to develop a cloud-enabled, highly scalable version of the computational core of the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software (MEGA-CC: www.megasoftware.net). The development of MEGA-CC is a significant component of the NIH-funded research project to develop machine learning methods and tools for comparative analysis of molecular sequences. With big advances in genome sequencing, researchers are assembling datasets containing large numbers of species, strains, genes, and genomic segments. Phylogenomic analyses of these data are essential to understanding the dynamics of evolutionary change of pathogens, humans, and species across the tree of life. Machine learning methods and software tools for phylogenomics are now necessary because the expanding size of phylogenomic datasets limits the practical utility of currently available methods and tools due to excessive computational time and memory requirements. One component of the funded grant is implementing our new machine learning methods in the MEGA software suite (www.megasoftware.net), an extremely popular bioinformatics software (>20,000 peer-reviewed citations and 350,000 software downloads in the year 2020 alone). The MEGA software includes a large repertoire of tools for assembling sequence alignments, inferring evolutionary trees, estimating genetic distances and diversities, inferring ancestral sequences, computing timetrees, and testing selection. These analyses are now required in all research investigations and fields in which multiple DNA or RNA sequences are used. However, MEGA and its computational core (MEGA-CC) are not optimized for distribution and execution on cloud infrastructure and high-performance computing clusters. This supplement to the funded grant will enable us to advance MEGA for cloud readiness to harness the scalability, elastic computing power, and easy software upgrade and maintenance enabled by cloud infrastructure (MEGA-CR). It will also make MEGA interoperable with existing and future cloud infrastructure. Additionally, this supplement will facilitate using the new machine learning methods in MEGA with big genomic data in practice, thus addressing an imminent and fast-growing need for an increasingly larger community of researchers using MEGA. MEGA-CR will increase the usability of MEGA for the scientific community analyzing very large datasets for which greater accessibility, cost-efficiency, and scalability of cloud-readiness is becoming crucial. Narrative We propose to develop a cloud-enabled, highly scalable version of the computational core of the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software (MEGA-CC: www.megasoftware.net). The development of MEGA-CC is a significant component of the NIH-funded parent research grant to develop machine learning methods and tools for comparative analysis of molecular sequences.

"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center. Project narrative This Project will improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by understanding and managing heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and from diverse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside.","Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity",10166783,U54CA209988,"['3-Dimensional', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational Materials', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'In Vitro', 'Infrastructure', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MDA-MB-468', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Resistance', 'SDZ RAD', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'analytical tool', 'bioimaging', 'bioprinting', 'cancer cell', 'combinatorial', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data management', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'light microscopy', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2021,1851265
