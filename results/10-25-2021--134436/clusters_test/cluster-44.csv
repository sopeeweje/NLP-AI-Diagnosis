"A Unified Nanopore Platform for Direct Sequencing of Individual Full Length RNA Strands Bearing Modified Nucleotides ABSTRACT We propose to implement a unified platform for detecting RNA nucleotide modifications on contiguous full length RNA strands using nanopore direct RNA sequencing. In principle, this technology could be used for all classes of RNA molecules in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. It is a logical technical advance for RNA sequencing because the current standard, sequencing-by-synthesis using Solexa technology requires conversion of native cellular RNA into short (~300 nt) cDNA amplicons. In so doing, nucleotide modifications are erased and the continuity of intact RNA strands is lost, thus precluding accurate quantification of RNA isoforms. Nanopore strand sequencing overcomes these limitations because the ~2 nanometer-long integral sensor touches and identifies each base along intact native RNA strands as they are driven through the pore by an applied voltage. Thus, end-to-end sequence analysis of a given RNA strand is achieved. During the grant period, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) Establish baseline performance of ONT direct RNA sequencing, and implement targeted improvements; 2) Implement methods to discover and document nucleotide modifications on native RNA strands; and 3) Optimize nanopore technology for analysis of mRNA isoform diversity. UC Santa Cruz is uniquely equipped to undertake this project: i) We pioneered nanopore RNA strand analysis (Akeson/Deamer) and recently demonstrated that the Oxford Nanopore MinION nanopore sequencer can resolve single nucleotide variants and base modifications in single 16S rRNA strands (Akeson). ii) Our RNA Center includes fourteen faculty members. Co-investigators on this application have expertise in mechanisms of RNA splicing (Sanford), the functional consequences of normal and aberrant RNA isoform synthesis (Brooks), and the structural biology of RNA (Ares). Collaborating RNA Center faculty will advise on nuclear non-coding RNA experiments (Carpenter, Kim) and on H9 ES cells (Salama). iii) Our Genomics Institute is internationally recognized for bioinformatics, including recent advances in application of Recurrent Neural Networks to human genome haplotyping, and genome-wide nanopore detection of base modifications (Paten). PROJECT NARRATIVE We will implement a unified nanopore platform for sequencing RNA nucleotide modifications on individual full length RNA strands. In principle, this platform could be used to sequence all classes of RNA molecules in human cells. This will provide unique insights into the role of RNA in neurodegenerative disorders, and in cancer.",A Unified Nanopore Platform for Direct Sequencing of Individual Full Length RNA Strands Bearing Modified Nucleotides,10163247,R01HG010053,"['7-methylguanosine', 'Algorithms', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Faculty', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inosine', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Length', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleotides', 'Performance', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Pseudouridine', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Technology', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'embryonic stem cell', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'member', 'nanometer', 'nanopore', 'neural network algorithm', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'sequencing platform', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'structural biology', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'voltage']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R01,2021,954816
"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling,10405893,R00HG010910,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Biological Transport', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterochromatin', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Motors', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Envelope', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Pore', 'Organelles', 'Outer Mitochondrial Membrane', 'Pattern', 'Peroxidases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Transport', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'active control', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'cell fixation', 'cell type', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education resources', 'experience', 'gene function', 'genomic tools', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanometer', 'neuropathology', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'ribosome profiling', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R00,2021,249000
"Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads Project Summary RNA modifications are pervasive throughout the human transcriptome and affect transcript stability, localization, and function. In particular, ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) edits in RNA have been shown to affect pre-mRNA splicing and alter codon sequence. Amino acid changes caused by inosines have been implicated in various deleterious conditions, which include cancer and diseases of the brain. However, previous literature mapping inosine positions in high-throughput were only able to do so inside the limited context provided by short RNA-Seq reads. As modifications can be transcript-specific, elucidating the association of inosines with full mRNA isoforms is crucial for a more rigorous understanding of the role of inosine modifications in the tissues of our body and, more broadly, disease. Therefore, I propose to investiate A-to-I editing in the context of diseased and non-diseased systems using full-length mRNA nanopore sequencing. The nanopore is able to sequence whole RNA strands by converting changes in electrical current caused by RNA translocating through the pore into nucleotide sequence. ​Aim 1 leverages high-accuracy nanopore cDNA sequencing of cellular systems with and without ADAR knockdown to interrogate ADAR function and A-to-I-induced changes to transcript expression changes. To accomplish the latter, I will develop workflows to determine isoform structure from noisy, long reads. In addition to sequencing full-length transcripts, nanopore native RNA (nvRNA) sequencing informs on RNA modifications, as modified nucleotides appear as subtle alteration in current signal with respect to canonical nucleotides. As such, ​Aim 2 ​employs a generalizable approach to producing cost-effective training data for systematically understanding how inosines alter current signals in nanopores. I will use a Cas13b-ADAR fusion protein (REPAIRv2) to create site-specific edits and then perform nvRNA sequencing on the edited transcriptome. Site-specific A-to-I editing allows this approach to create a labelled inosine dataset in nvRNA signal from which I can develop computational algorithms to reliably identify inosines in nvRNA data. The REPAIRv2 approach to can be generalized to eventually identify any RNA modification with nanopores. ​Aim 3 will elucidate how A-to-I editing differs between tissues. I will sequence 4 normal tissue types with nvRNA sequencing, generating a map of A-to-I edits in conjunction with isoform usage using the software I am developing. Taken together, the fulfillment of these aims will not only provide further insights on elusive ADAR mechanism, but also create workflows for nanopore data analysis and a platform for the study of any modification. As I work toward my Ph.D. with this interdisciplinary project, I will gain invaluable skills in experimental and computational biology that will prepare me for a career in science. Project Narrative Understanding the functional outcomes of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in greater depth is crucial to understanding cancer, diseases of the brain, and other deleterious effects that arise from modification misregulation. To study inosines in full-length mRNA contexts, we will use nanopore sequencing to generate a map of A-to-I editing in diseased and non-diseased transcriptomes. The objective of this proposal is to develop the experimental and computational requisites for identifying inosine modifications in nanopore native RNA sequencing data, particularly for illuminating the interplay between A-to-I editing, alternative splicing, and mRNA regulation.",Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads,10168450,F31HG010999,"['Address', 'Adenosine', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acids', 'Atlases', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breast', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enzymes', 'Exons', 'Functional disorder', 'Guanosine', 'Human', 'Inosine', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neurons', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Poly(A) Tail', 'Polyadenylation', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Work', 'adenosine deaminase', 'base', 'career', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'functional outcomes', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'mRNA Precursor', 'machine learning method', 'nanopore', 'neuron loss', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,F31,2021,38613
"Efficient Methods for Dimensionality Reduction ofSingle-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data Project Summary: Efficient Methods for Dimensionality Reduction of Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data Single-cell RNA-sequencing is a revolutionary technology enabling discoveries in human physiology and disease. The datasets generated from single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments are so large that they cannot be analyzed or visualized using traditional statistical methods until the datasets have been shrunk using a technique named “dimensionality reduction.” Almost every analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing begins using a technique named principal component analysis (PCA) to accomplish dimensionality reduction. However, single-cell RNA-sequencing presents unique challenges making PCA difficult. First, the size of these datasets is so large that computing PCA requires specialized hardware and multiple hours. Fast algorithms to approximate PCA have been shown to dramatically speed up this process, but have not proliferated in the single cell-RNA sequencing community, in part because no parallelized algorithm has been written in the R computing language. Second, PCA requires the researcher to decide the final desired size of the dataset. Choosing too small of a size results in discarding valuable biological insights, while choosing too large a size increases the noise. However, there is no consensus on how to pick the optimal size for single-cell RNA sequencing, and there is evidence that this size might be systematically underestimated. Lastly, PCA cannot be applied directly to the count-data measured in single cell RNA sequencing, so researchers must first apply a preprocessing technique to normalize it. The current standard in the field is to apply the log transform – however, several recent studies have shown that the log transform creates statistical biases in single-cell RNA sequencing. In this fellowship, specifically tailored, fast methods for performing PCA on single-cell RNA- sequencing data will be developed: 1a) A framework to rigorously measure the consequence of changing preprocessing parameters on the final results of several publicly available single cell RNA sequencing datasets to enable experimentation of PCA on single-cell RNA-sequencing data. 1b) An ultra-fast, parallelized implementation of randomized PCA allowing researchers using standard laptops to rapidly perform PCA on single cell RNA sequencing data. 2) A technique for rigorously choosing the final size when performing principal component analysis for single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. 3) A method for transforming single-cell RNA-sequencing data so that it becomes appropriately distributed enabling proper usage of PCA without incurring statistical biases. This fellowship also includes a detailed training plan with valuable learning experiences for the applicant’s development as a physician-scientist who can apply methods from high dimensional-statistics to solving biomedical problems. Project Narrative: Single-cell RNA-sequencing is a revolutionary technology enabling discoveries in human physiology and disease. The data sets collected by this technology are so large that they require specialized statistical techniques to analyze using cumbersome computing hardware – however, these techniques were designed for a different type of data and consequently they create systematic biases.

"Systematic identification of RNA sequences and protein components regulating circular RNA translation PROJECT SUMMARY  The human genome encodes tens of thousands of circRNAs, of which the translation is essential for regulating important biological functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Interference with circRNA translation can lead to tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancers. It is unclear, however, how disrupting circRNA translation can cause the diseases. Identifying the regulatory components of circRNA translation can provide valuable clinical insights. However, current technologies cannot distinguish circRNAs from linear RNAs efficiently, such that the mechanism and molecular components regulating circRNA translation remain unclear. Thus, it is imperative to develop a technology that can identify the components regulating circRNA translation with higher sensitivity and specificity.  I have developed a high-throughput reporter screening assay that can systematically screen and identify the RNA sequences that initiate circRNA translation specifically. Utilizing the technology, I discovered two groups of the RNA sequences that specifically drive translation on either circRNA or linear RNA, respectively, indicating that the regulatory components between linear RNA and circRNA translation are different (Chen et al., resubmitted to Science). In this proposed research, I will further adapt and apply this novel technology to (i) identify and characterize the sequence and protein components that regulate circRNA translation specifically, (ii) identify the association between genetic variation, circRNA translation, and disease, (iii) characterize circRNA translation in a tissue-dependent manner systematically, and (iv) build a non-integrative and stable gene expression platform with tunable expression level and tissue specificity. This proposed research will build the foundation of my future research as an independent researcher to investigate the regulation and the coordination between different translation machinery (cap-dependent vs. independent translation) among different RNA species (linear vs. circular RNAs).  This work will be performed under the mentorship of Dr. Howard Chang at the Stanford University School of Medicine, an expert in technology development and RNA biology who has highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions. Further training in scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs, which provide an outstanding intellectually- stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success. All proposed training will complement my previous training in RNA biology, technology development, and computer programming and facilitate my transition to an independent researcher, investigating the functions, regulations and clinical implications of circRNA.

"High-throughput detection of transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic variation and kinetics using MarathonRT Project Summary The discovery and characterization of an efficient, ultraprocessive reverse transcriptase (MarathonRT) now makes it possible to develop high-throughput methods for accurate end-to- end sequencing of long RNA transcripts, thereby preserving information content on alternative splicing, editing and modification isoforms while conserving positional linkage information, thereby enabling one to distinguish RNA isoforms in complex mixtures without mapping to a reference genome. This type of technology is essential for deciphering the role of post- transcriptional RNA processing events during control of developmental stage, cell and tissue specificity and regulation of gene expression in higher organisms. It must be sufficiently efficient and accurate to power the long-read sequencing approaches that are used in single- cell RNAseq, particularly when transcript diversification is monitored as a function of time. The first two aims of the proposal are focused on high-throughput detection of RNA modifications (such as 2-O-methyl groups and N7-methyl guanosines). In the first aim, a unique MarathonRT primer extension protocol will be combined with a trained mutational profiling algorithm to recognize the positions and chemical identities of specific RNA modifications, reporting a modification signature that can be recognized at high throughput during long-read sequencing (MRT-ModSeq). In the second aim, MRT-ModSeq will be tested on unknown RNAs, where it will be used to predict sites of modifications on challenging long transcripts and robustness of the predictions will be directly evaluated using mass spectrometry. The second half of the proposal is focused on identification of linked alternative splicing and editing sites on long transcripts within complex cellular mixtures. In aim 3, MarathonRT will be incorporated into a workflow for accurately profiling the relative abundance and processing diversity of the highly complex paralytic (para) gene, which encodes more than 1 million possible processing variants, a subset of which are essential for the voltage-gating of a sodium channel. This sets the stage for Aim 4, in which sensitivity of the workflow must be further optimized and merged with data analysis strategies suitable for time-resolved single cell applications. The resulting method will be tested by monitoring full-length transcriptomic signatures induced by cell stress. Project Narrative Relevance: A single DNA gene produces many different RNA molecules that differ in size and composition, and each of them plays a distinct role in cellular function and the life of an organism.

"Methods for improving clinical diagnostic by detection, prediction, interpretation and prioritization of aberrant transcriptome variations The goal of this research program project is to develop methods to improve clinical diagnosis of children with rare Mendelian disorders. Even with the most advanced standard-of-care genetic test of exome sequencing (ES) diagnostic rate is still below 50%. One reason for this rate is that mutations in non-protein coding regions or those that are synonymous (code for the same protein) are generally discarded even though these could be deleterious due to their effect on the processing of RNA transcribed from the underlying gene. We propose 2 complementary methods to help improve clinical diagnosis: The first is “RNA-first”, where our algorithms suggest which clinically accessible tissue (CAT) to use for RNA sequencing, then compare the results to a larger pool of donors to detect which RNA processing variations may be deleterious. The second is a “DNA-first” approach where we develop “RNA splicing code” models that predict the effect of genetic variations on RNA processing in a given tissue of interest. The two approaches, “RNA-first” and “DNA-first”, will be combined into a clinical diagnostic pipeline at the Children Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and applied to solve undiagnosed cases at CHOP and other centers, including the NIH’s Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN). Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause. This project will develop new computer technology to do a more complete analysis of their genetic testing information to help diagnose more of these children.","Methods for improving clinical diagnostic by detection, prediction, interpretation and prioritization of aberrant transcriptome variations",10227951,R01LM013437,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Benchmarking', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Human', 'International', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mutation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'causal variant', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'congenital anomaly', 'deep learning', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,346597
"Model-guided design of RNA stabilizing elements for improved coronavirus diagnostics Project Summary Fast, inexpensive, and sensitive methods to detect the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus are instrumental in containing the spread of COVID-19. Currently, nucleic acid testing of respiratory samples using RT-PCR is the primary and most commonly used method for diagnosing patients in the acute phase of the infection. However, this standard approach suffers from the need for special equipment and well-trained personnel and hence has become a bottleneck to meet the urgent demand for large-scale screening. A range of new RNA-based technologies, including toehold switches and CRISPR/Cas systems, are being actively developed with the aim to implement diagnostic tests that are ultra-sensitive, easy to deploy, and make use of enzymes and reagents separate from the traditional PCR pipeline. One common and critical component of these methods is the engineering of RNA molecules to detect target viral sequences. Consequently, their performance in terms of specificity and sensitivity have been significantly hindered by the fast degradation of RNAs caused by the RNases ubiquitous in both clinical sample matrices and as byproducts of biomolecular reagent production. Here we propose to enhance coronavirus diagnostic performance by programming RNase resistance into assay components, in turn increasing RNA stability and enhancing test sensitivity and speed. We will rationally design RNA 5’ UTR sequences and the resulting secondary structures of mRNA, toehold switch RNA, and CRISPR guide RNAs to modulate their resistance to RNase activities and hence quantitatively tune their stability. Results from the proposed forward engineering studies will increase our understanding and control of RNA dynamics and provide a widely applicable strategy to improve coronavirus detection efficiencies of many technologies under development. Impact: A comprehensively studied RNA design scheme to improve RNA stability will be complementary to current technologies under development to give them a boost in performance, and provide underlying design strategies with potential broader applicability, such as overcoming the stability barrier for mRNA-based vaccines. There are three specific aims in this proposal: Aim 1: Characterize and model the role of 5’ secondary structures in fine-tuning mRNA stability; Aim 2: Optimize sensing RNAs for detection of COVID-19; Aim 3: Use dtRNAs to enhance sample and amplified RNA stability for improved diagnostics.

"miR-92a as a biomarker of diabetic retinopathy Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a global problem due to an alarming increase in the number of individuals with diabetes. The lack of an early diagnostic tool predicting retinal vascular health is a critical barrier to progress. To this end, we have identified circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) as ideal reporter cells, which are most receptive to changes of diabetic milieu and retinopathy. Our preliminary studies suggest that CACs map a distinct RNA signature. We also found that a miRNA, miR-92a, is downregulated explicitly in CACs with DR, and its overexpression in CACs of people with diabetes decreased pro-inflammatory markers, such as IL-1β and CD14, emphasizing the importance of CACs for biomarker discovery of retinal vascular health. Our preliminary studies using machine learning models could accurately predict DR providing us a stronger rationale for developing this paradigm for our robust study design. Furthermore, using rodent models, we found a decrease in miR-92a in lineage-Sca1+c-kit+ (LSK; mouse equivalent of CACs) parallels with an increase in acellular capillaries, and miR- 92a inhibition in LSKs triggered a stronger inflammatory response. Therefore, this proposal's overarching goal is to study RNA (miRNA and mRNA) and inflammatory signature using a robust sequencing paradigm and differential modeling in individuals with different severities of DR and animal models to gain insights into retinal vascular health. Our central hypothesis is that RNA signature in CACs mirror DR severity, and miR-92a decrease within CACs serves as a candidate biomarker. We propose the following specific aims to test our hypothesis: Aim 1: To assess changes in RNA levels in CACs of patients with different severity of DR and validate miR-92a as a candidate biomarker. Aim 2: Determine whether the miR-92a loss in bone marrow cells is associated with the development of DR in rodents. We anticipate that our proposed studies will identify specific mRNA and miRNA changes of DR severity and validate miR-92a as a novel biomarker for retinal vascular health. Overall, our studies will help improve the standard of care of DR individuals by aiding in diagnosis, prognosis and providing mechanistic insights for future therapies. While diabetic retinopathy (DR) cases are rising globally, and newer treatments are emerging, there is a lack of biomarkers reflecting retinal vascular health. We propose that the RNA levels (mRNA and miRNA) and inflammation in circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) will serve as a biomarker of DR. We will perform RNA sequencing of CACs in DR patients and study how a change in miRNA levels leads to retinopathy using rodent models.",miR-92a as a biomarker of diabetic retinopathy,10297984,R01EY032080,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD14 gene', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electroretinography', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Exhibits', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'ITGA5 gene', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Messenger RNA', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-kit', 'RNA', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TLR6 gene', 'Testing', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validity of Results', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visual impairment', 'autocrine', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'differential expression', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'migration', 'non-diabetic', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'paracrine', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'repaired', 'reparative capacity', 'retinal damage', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'vascular injury']",NEI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,472042
"Rapid Sample Preparation and Ultrasensitive Detection of COVID-19 in Human Saliva Project Summary The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) – is a global pandemic with worldwide cases of over 35 million and a death toll of over 1 million people. In the United States, there are a total of over 7.5 million cases with over 210,000 deaths as of October 2020. The ability to identify COVID-19 infected patients rapidly, accurately, and cost-effectively is of paramount importance to control the disease outbreak. The two different types of COVID-19 tests are diagnostic tests and antibody tests. Specifically, the diagnostic tests can only identify active COVID-19 infected patients; the antibody tests can only indicate prior COVID-19 infections but not active cases. These diagnostic tests include quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and rapid antigen tests. In particular, the qRT-PCR is currently the most sensitive method (down to ~100 copies/mL) but can take >12 hours to perform and require trained personnel, specific reagents, and expensive machines. The rapid antigen tests provide results within 30 minutes, but these tests require the samples to contain high virus concentration (i.e., >107 virus particles/mL) leading to increasing chances of false-negative cases. In addition, one common example of the antibody tests is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This test only applies to patients who have already developed the antibodies, which could take several days to weeks. Thus far, no single tests can detect both active and previously COVID-19 infected cases. The objective of the proposed research is to develop a proof-of-concept rapid and ultrasensitive virus-detection platform termed viral-ID, which is capable of simultaneous detecting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies inside saliva for the identification of both active and previous COVID-19 infections within a single test. Specifically, the viral-ID platform will allow for specific molecular targeting, separation, enrichment, and filtering, all carried out within a single saliva droplet utilizing the nature-inspired coffee ring effect. Targeting and detection of the viral biomarkers will be carried out by aptamer-functionalized nanoparticles and deep-learning-enabled surface- enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), respectively. Using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibody-spiked saliva as a model system, the goal of this research is to demonstrate a bio-analysis platform capable of rapid sample preparation and ultrasensitive detection of both viral RNA (~10 – 100 copies/mL) and antibodies (~femtomolar) in a saliva droplet within 30 minutes. If successful, our viral-ID platform will provide all-in-one and best-in-class diagnostic and antibody test in terms of speed, sensitivity, and specificity for the rapid screening of COVID-19.

"Learning the Regulatory Code of Alzheimer's Disease Genomes Project Summary Alternative splicing is a key cellular process whose dysregulation has been implicated broadly across human genetic disease. Dr. Knowles previously developed LeafCutter, a flexible, scalable, annotation-free tool to quantify local patterns of RNA splicing from short-read RNA-seq data. While LeafCutter has been quite widely adopted and we have actively maintained it and addressed issues on github, it remains “early stage” software. We propose software engineering improvements: 1) appropriate packaging using conda with standard build, installation, testing and logging processes, 2) containerization using Docker, 3) standardization of input/output data formats/interfaces, and 4) refactoring to use a standard workflow language. These improvements will allow us to distribute LeafCutter through repositories including PyPI, BioConda, DockStore, and Galaxy. Finally improvements to documentation, testing and version management will make contributions to LeafCutter from the open source community more feasible and easier to integrate. The parent award for the proposed work is U01 AG068880-01 “Learning the Regulatory Code of Alzheimer's Disease Genomes”, where we are developing state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models to better understand the genetic basis of AD. This award makes extensive use of LeafCutter. In Aim 1 we are building DL models of pre- and post- transcriptional regulation: for the latter LeafCutter provides training data for our neural network model of the sequence determinants of RNA splicing in AD-relevant cell types and states. In Aim 2 we connect AD-associated structural variation to functional variation, including RNA splicing variation. In Aim 3, we will build trans-expression QTL networks across thousands of post-mortem brain samples: with the improvements to the LeafCutter ecosystem proposed here we will be able to straightforwardly extend to trans splicing QTL networks. While we and our collaborators are ourselves heavy users of LeafCutter, we will continue to ensure we provide for the needs and use-cases of the broader genomics community. Alternative splicing is an important cellular process where “junk” DNA is removed from the gene before it is translated into protein. When this process is disrupted in some way it can cause disease.

"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills. NARRATIVE  Every animal's life starts by a drastic and controlled remodeling of gene expression following the fertilization of the egg by the sperm.

"Robust identification and accurate quantification of RNA transcripts on a system wide scale Contact PD/PI: Li, Jingyi Project Summary Next-generation, Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is by far the most widely used assay for investigating animal transcriptomes, and numerous public RNA-seq data sets have been generated for various biological conditions in multiple species. However, there remain several barriers in using short RNA-seq reads to accurately identify the splicing structures and quantify the abundances of full-length RNA transcripts. In this proposal, we will develop a series of novel statistical and computational methods to improve the robustness of transcript identification and the accuracy of transcript quantification from Illumina RNA-seq data. (Aim 1) We will develop a novel screening method to construct transcript candidates by first detecting sparse splicing structures from multiple RNA-seq data sets for a given biological condition. These transcript candidates will significantly reduce the search space of downstream transcript identification methods and hence improve their precision. (Aim 2) We will develop a robust transcript identification method to identify novel transcripts in a conservative manner from RNA-seq data given existing annotations. Our method will be based on statistical model selection under the Neyman-Pearson paradigm, which will allow users to control the false positive rate of our identified novel transcripts under any given threshold with high probability. (Aim 3) We will develop an accurate transcript quantification method to effectively leverage multiple RNA-seq data sets and to simultaneously assess the data quality based on low-throughput gold standards and cross-data similarities. All of these methods will be first used to study transcripts in mouse macrophage, for which gold standard qPCR and full length cDNA sequences will be generated for training and method validation. The methods will then be more broadly tested in other biological systems where suitable gold standard data is available. Our methods and software will significantly facilitate the use of Illumina RNA-seq data for gene expression studies at the transcript level, increase reproducibility of scientific discoveries from transcriptomic studies, and improve our understanding of gene expression mechanisms in various biological conditions. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: Li, Jingyi Project Narrative This project will create a set of computational methods to improve the robustness and accuracy of detecting and quantifying RNA molecules from next-generation RNA sequencing data. Those methods will serve as useful tools for investigating gene expression changes in different biological conditions on a finer scale at the transcript level.

"Integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data Many projects have characterized the human brain transcriptome within and across cell types to better understand changes in RNA expression associated with brain development and aging, developmental or psychiatric brain disorders, and genetic variation. Large consortia, including psychENCODE, CommonMind and BrainSeq Consortiums, have primarily focused on the molecular profiling of RNA extracted from homogenate/bulk tissue from different brain regions across thousands of individuals. However, bulk tissue like the frontal cortex contains a mixture of different important cell populations, and failing to account for the underlying composition of tissue samples can cause both false positives and missed signal in differential expression analysis. Therefore, statistical methods referred to as ""cellular deconvolution"" have been developed that estimate the relative fractions of different cell types in bulk RNA-seq datasets. These cell fractions can then be used to control for differences in cell composition across bulk tissue samples and can better determine the cell type(s) that drive differential expression signal in bulk tissue data. However, these approaches require reference expression profiles from the underlying cell types that will be estimated, which can be difficult to generate from human postmortem brain tissue. Recent approaches have leveraged single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets to construct these reference profiles and perform cellular deconvolution, particularly in peripheral tissues. While many statistical or machine learning approaches have been proposed, the majority produce similar composition estimates for a given reference dataset. However, as we describe in this application, many of these existing reference datasets -regardless of the algorithm employed - are largely non- comparable to the vast majority of bulk RNA sequencing data generated from postmortem human brain tissue, and have produced incorrect estimates of cellular composition. Current algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the relative fraction of cell types. We therefore propose to generate a more comprehensive framework for performing cellular deconvolution in human postmortem RNA- seq data.This proposal will leverage the extensive bulk RNA sequencing performed over the past decade to better determine the relative role of cell type-specific expression in the human brain and their subsequent dysregulation in debilitating brain disorders. Recent approaches have leveraged single cell or nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to perform cellular deconvolution on homogenate datasets, but many current algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the relative fraction of cell types. This proposal therefore aims to develop novel reference and validation datasets necessary to implement cellular, and not RNA, deconvolution from RNA-seq datasets, which will become publicly available software. We will lastly apply this novel deconvolution approach to thousands of homogenate RNA-seq samples to identify cell type-specific insights into debilitating brain disorders.",Integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data,10138028,R01MH123183,"['Accounting', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Bioconductor', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cell Fraction', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nuclear', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'differential expression', 'excitatory neuron', 'frontal lobe', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'oligodendrocyte precursor', 'secondary analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical learning', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web app']",NIMH,"LIEBER INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2021,507442
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms.

"Scalable 3D molecular imaging and data analysis for cell census generation PROJECT SUMMARY This project is a collaboration across two universities and multiple scientific disciplines to develop new scalable 3D molecular imaging and analysis approaches for cell type identification within human brain tissue. We will focus our efforts on the olfactory system, comprising the olfactory epithelium (OE) and the olfactory bulb (OB). This system is an ideally confined human model system to build and test a new suite of scalable tools for the generation of a human brain atlas because the connectomics of olfactory sensory neurons to the bulb is dictated by olfactory receptor expression. Our long term goals are to provide the community with new “physics-first” methods that improve scalability, rigor, and 3D measurements for cell census creation and create the first spatial map of connections between the OE and OB. We plan to achieve our goals across two specific aims, carried out in parallel. In our first aim, we will scale up high-resolution, high-speed single objective light-sheet microscopy for 3D imaging of proteins and RNA in the human olfactory bulb. Using linear unmixing, we will image up to 8 proteins. Using iterative amplified RNA-FISH labeling by fluidic exchange, we will initially image 130 RNAs and detail plans to expand the number of RNA. In our second aim, we will develop a Bayesian nonparametric image analysis framework that self-consistently and simultaneously determines the probability associated with all RNA locations, numbers, and identities in the presence of variable autofluorescence and variable readout efficiency. Within the Bayesian paradigm, we propose a new approach to error correction in barcoded fluorescence experiments that significantly reduces the number of rounds required. We will apply these combined fundamental improvements to map full sections of the OB to determine the targeting of glomeruli by olfactory sensory neurons expressing specific olfactory receptors. As olfactory receptors have high homology and sparse expression, both in situ hybridization and in situ sequencing may report a high number of false positives or false negatives. To mitigate potential identification errors, we will evaluate dual-color amplified labeling strategies combined with Bayesian nonparametric analysis that assigns probabilities based on a self-consistent analysis of all image stacks across all colors simultaneously to avoid drawing conclusions based on local assessments of the identity of a bright spot. Combining these methodological advancements, we will generate 3D spatial maps of confidence intervals for cell types and individual olfactory receptors expression across the olfactory system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding how the human brain perceives odorants requires mapping the connectivity of the olfactory system. In this proposal, we propose to develop and apply new scalable 3D imaging and analysis methods to determine the location of glomeruli targeted by olfactory sensory neurons expressing specific olfactory receptors, the olfactory bulb connectome. This method will be scalable to other brain regions allowing systematic development of a human cell atlas key to understanding human brain function in health and disease.",Scalable 3D molecular imaging and data analysis for cell census generation,10369885,RF1MH128867,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Atlases', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bar Codes', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Fluorescence', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Morphology', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Epithelium', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Olfactory Receptor Cells', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA amplification', 'Receptor Gene', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Sensory', 'Speed', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular scale', 'novel strategies', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory bulb glomeruli', 'olfactory receptor', 'olfactory sensory neurons', 'receptor expression', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,RF1,2021,2234299
"Cell free RNA liquid biopsies ABSTRACT The ultimate goal of this proposal is to verify an RNA liquid biopsy platform and transition it to have specific utility for the study, and non-invasive assessment, of the hematopoietic bone marrow (BM) niche. In addition to their reliance of material excreted from dying, diseased cells, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) platforms are limited to primarily detecting changes in somatic genomic sequence, copy number, or methylation status. Many biological and clinical events, such as hematopoiesis, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis, are executed via global changes in transcriptional regulation. My PhD advisor Dr. Daniel Kim and I have established a platform for exRNA liquid biopsy in human blood-plasma that has demonstrated significant diagnostic and monitoring potential in both Pancreatic cancer and COVID-19 patients. I propose to continue this research to complete my PhD by assessing diagnostic performance of the exRNA platform in a new cohort of 60 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with matched controls. Furthermore, I will apply my expertise in exRNA liquid biopsies to assay the transcriptional dynamics of hematopoiesis and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (BM) niche. Currently, bone marrow biopsies or aspirations are used to determine bone marrow health and production. These techniques are costly and require sedation and/or pain relief for the subject and have the potential to lead to long term discomfort, infection, excessive bleeding, and other side-effects. BM aspirations remain a critical diagnostic and monitoring tool for HSC transplant recovery, leukemias and lymphomas, blood cell pathologies, and infections of unknown origin but the primary readout remains identification and counting of cell types. I hypothesize that hematopoietic lineages within the BM secrete exRNA that reflect cell state and identity that can be used in a non-invasive RNA liquid biopsy for detailed study of transcription and populations within the BM. I propose to identify exRNA expressed and secreted by HSCs and the remaining hematopoietic lineage in order to develop a platform to deconvolute peripheral blood into constituent hematopoietic cell types without the need for HSC mobilization. NARRATIVE Liquid biopsies are poised to revolutionize diagnostic procedures by making them more accessible and less invasive due to the use of biofluids like blood rather than tissue samples. During my PhD I have helped develop an RNA liquid biopsy platform that the F99 will enable me to lead a validation for in patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. As an NIDDK K00 fellow, I will expand the RNA liquid biopsy platform into a hematological context that will identify extracellular RNA markers of the hematopoietic lineage in- and ex-vivo.",Cell free RNA liquid biopsies,10363505,F99DK131504,"['Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Aspiration', 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Mentorship', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Methylation', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Production', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA marker', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Sedation procedure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell', 'cell free DNA', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'liquid biopsy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'pain relief', 'pancreatic cancer patients', 'peripheral blood', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'side effect', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'specific biomarkers', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,F99,2021,44710
"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location.

"Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo. ABSTRACT: “Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo”  microRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small regulatory RNAs involved in repression of gene expression. They recognize their target mRNAs though base pairing and upon binding, trigger translational repression, deadenylation and decay of the target mRNAs. Given that each miRNA has the potential to regulate hundreds of genes, and several dozens of miRNAs are expressed in each cell type, miRNAs are one of the master regulators of gene expression at post-transcriptional level in animals, plants and virus. Thus, the elucidation of the miRNA complement is essential to understand gene regulation and mRNA turnover. The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method for miRNA discovery and experimental validation in vivo.  Current miRNA discovery methods heavily rely on providing sequencing evidence of a small RNA that fits into a hairpin-like structure predicted bioinformatically. The problem is that sample availability or the abundance of a specific cell type in a tissue may be limited and hamper the number of miRNAs that can be backed-up with sequencing support. In these situations, the current solution is to sequence deeper, increasing overall costs. On the other hand, the presence of a small RNA of ~22-nt does not guarantee the belonging to the miRNA family, as random degradation of cellular RNAs also will produce small RNAs of this size and only tedious experimental validation of their processing into intermediate species and mature miRNA can confirm their identity.  A recent curation work found that of the over ~7,000 metazoan miRNAs in miRBase, the reference miRNA database, only 1,175 fulfilled the features necessary to pass as miRNAs, directly rejected 3,470 as false positives and lacked enough sequencing evidence to call another 2,105 miRNAs. Therefore, there is an unmet technological need to develop a miRNA validation method that boosts the access to the miRNA candidates even from limited samples and that allows rigorous multiplexed experimental validation of their processing.  With the synergy of an interdisciplinary team that combines expertise in microRNAs and zebrafish manipulation (Dr. Cifuentes, PI) and bioinformatics (Dr. Moxon, co-I), we will develop miRAGe (miRNA Analysis Genome wide), a high-throughput method to integrate miRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. The fundamental concept behind miRAGe is the use of living cells as “organic computers” to analyze miRNA processing. We will use massively parallel oligo pool synthesis to prepare the miRNA candidate precursors and test their processing in injected zebrafish embryos. Small RNA sequencing will determine which candidates are true microRNA by detecting their ~22-nucleotide mature product and their stereotypic intermediates.  Overall, the results from this project will transform the access of the scientific community to high quality, experimentally validated miRNA data from any organism with genomic data available, thus enhancing future transversal studies on post-transcriptional regulation. NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method to integrate microRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. We will take advantage of oligo pool synthesis to prepare the microRNA candidate precursors and test their processing after injection in zebrafish embryos.

"Genomics-based approaches to understanding mechanistic alterations of spliceosome function in disease states Splicing factors are frequently altered by mutations and copy-number changes both in cancer and in germline genetic diseases resulting in multi-system developmental syndromes. Despite the fact that virtually all genes in humans undergo splicing, spliceosomal genetic alterations tend to exhibit surprisingly specific effects on subsets of splicing events, leaving most insignificantly changed. These effects can be allele-specific, cell-type specific, and dependent on the genetic background of the afflicted cell. This makes it especially challenging to determine which affected splicing events contribute to disease etiology. The fact that a limited set of introns is responsive to any specific splicing factor alteration indicates that introns and their flanking exons have evolved in structure and sequence to confer differential sensitivity to the action of different spliceosome components. This raises a fundamental question: what are the features common to sets of introns that confer this specificity? Using naturally occurring splicing gene mutations, amplifications, and deletions, these perturbations will be modelled in a genetically stable, untransformed, isogenic cell system where it is possible to isolate the effect of a single alteration on the transcriptome and on the binding patterns of the altered protein. These studies will shed light on the mechanisms of normal spliceosome function, and provide insight into which genes and biological pathways affected by splicing dysfunction likely contribute to disease states.  The proposed experiments will employ three distinct methods to model spliceosome perturbations associated with human disease, with a focus on factors that physically or functionally interact with the essential spliceosome protein SF3B1. (Specific Aim 1) Introduction of an allelic series of cancer-associated SF3B1 missense-mutations into isogenic cell lines using recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE); (Specific Aim 2) CRISPRa/i-mediated activation or inhibition of transcription to up- or down- regulate splicing factors that are amplified in cancers (PUF60, SF3B4, and U2AF2) and lost in developmental syndromes (PUF60, SF3B4); and (Specific Aim 3) rapid depletion of spliceosomal RNA helicases (DDX39B, DDX46, and DHX16) and their putative co-factors (SUGP1, RBM17, and GPKOW) at the protein level using auxin-inducible degrons. Three distinct methods of RNA sequencing will be used to quantify the changes resulting from these perturbations: poly(A)-selected RNAseq, allele-specific eCLIP, and a novel intron lariat capture sequencing approach. Lastly, we will integrate these genomic data sets into models using deep learning neural networks to interrogate our central hypothesis: the sequence and structure of individual mammalian introns have evolved to confer differential dependence on specific ‘core’ components of the spliceosome, and that mutations, amplifications, and deletions in these core components causal for human disease will uncover intron-centric gene expression regulatory circuits that are controlled though modulation of the abundance or activity of the associated splicing factors in normal cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE The essential spliceosome protein SF3B1 functions as a hub to coordinate the positioning and dynamic rearrangements of numerous RNA and protein splicing factors. SF3B1, as well as many of its interacting cofactors, are frequently mutated, amplified, or deleted in cancers and in developmental syndromes, yet rather than affecting all introns equally, these disease-associated alterations in the core of the spliceosome have different and specific effects on subsets of introns.

"Measuring allele and isoform-specific RBP binding to improve predictive models of RNA splicing PROJECT SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental cellular process that regulates 95% of multi-exon genes to diversify protein output and define cell-type specific functions. Both constitutive splicing and AS are controlled by combinations of cis-acting pre-messenger RNA sequences (pre-mRNA) and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Therefore, defects in splicing regulatory RNA sequence or RBPs can be highly disruptive to basic cellular activities and often lead to disease, especially neurological and muscular disorders and cancer. While the constitutive splicing code is well established, the AS code is more complicated and, thus, poorly understood. This proposal integrates multiple cutting-edge approaches to take an RBP-centric view of AS to study both cis genetic variants and trans RBP expression effects on RBP binding and splicing outcome. While thousands of non-coding genetic variants are associated with splicing variation, and are thus termed putative splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), the causal variants and their molecular effects, such as RBP binding, are largely unclear. Aim 1 will address this gap by integrating RBP-focused experiments, allele-specific genomics, and state- of-the-art machine learning predictive models to characterize an important category of functional, cis non-coding variants that alter RBP binding. Importantly, I will take a unique approach to include these allele-specific RBP binding data as additional training data for our Convolutional Neural Net model. Model output is expected to much more accurately predict functional RBP binding effects of even a single nucleotide change in sequence, enabling improved interpretation of sQTLs. In addition to genetic variant effects, changes in RBP expression can have amplified downstream effects on RNA splicing. Interestingly, ~86% of RBP genes can be expressed as more than one splice isoform, but most studies to date have ignored RBP isoform-specific abundance and function. Aim 2 will provide foundational experiments to understand differential RBP isoform effects by using a novel approach to knockdown RBP isoforms by targeting Cas13 to unique exon junctions. Data from downstream assays that assess changes in RBP binding, splicing, and RNA localization will be integrated to construct the most comprehensive RBP regulatory networks to date. Results from both aims are essential to mechanistically link RNA sequence and RBP binding to splicing outcome and, ultimately, to phenotype and disease. My long-term goal is to become a principal investigator, where I will continue to leverage molecular biology, machine learning, and statistical genetics to answer unique questions about RNA-mediated associations between non-coding sequence and cellular and disease phenotype. The research and training plans proposed here are strategically tailored to provide ample opportunities to learn and apply machine learning and statistical genetics methods that complement my former PhD training in molecular biology and genomics. My sponsor, co- sponsor, and collaborators at the NYGC are committed to providing the scientific expertise, computational training, and career development mentoring to ensure the successful achievement of my goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Splicing is one of the earliest RNA processing events that regulates nearly every gene in every cell, thereby driving cell-type diversity and function. Mis-regulation at the level of splicing due to genetic variants in RNA sequence or defects in regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are highly disruptive to basic molecular processes and often lead to disease. This proposal aims to mechanistically link genetic variants and RBP effects to splicing outcome to improve interpretation of consortia-level DNA and RNA sequencing data as it relates to phenotypic traits and disease.",Measuring allele and isoform-specific RBP binding to improve predictive models of RNA splicing,10234638,F32GM142213,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fellowship', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Myopathy', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Splicing', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Ribonucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'career development', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'convolutional neural network', 'differential expression', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'knock-down', 'mRNA Precursor', 'molecular phenotype', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'nuclease', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'recruit', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,F32,2021,65994
"Pre-mRNA intronic structures in trans factor binding and alternative splicing Project Summary Splicing is the process of removing intronic regions from a precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) and combining exons into a mature transcript. Alternative splicing results in differential intron removal, producing multiple alternatively spliced isoforms arising from a common precursor mRNA. The dysregulation of splicing is estimated to underlie at least 15% of human diseases, and is likely to contribute to many more. Splice reactions are performed by the spliceosome, an RNA protein complex that is assembled onto precursor mRNA in stages. The final activity of the spliceosome is influenced by a combination of trans-acting spliceosome factors and cis elements within the precursor mRNA. However, factors involved in cis element function, like sequence motifs and RNA structure folds, are not fully understood, and a majority of such elements remain unidentified. This is particularly true for branchpoint selection, an essential early stage of spliceosome assembly within the intron around the catalytic adenosine. Although the branchpoint is loosely recognized as a highly degenerate sequence motif, it influences downstream splice site selection. My first goal is to elucidate the impact of RNA structure on branchpoint selection by focusing on RNA structure-mediated binding by the spliceosome associated SF3B complex. To do so, I will develop RNA secondary structure models for SF3B-dependent precursor RNAs to identify enriched structural motifs. My work will entail the first large-scale derivation of intronic secondary structures, including branchpoint regions, which will aid in better understanding of how RNA structures around cis regulatory elements influence splicing. My second goal is to develop a system to identify cis splicing regulatory elements and rapidly test their functional significance. To identify regulatory elements, I will identify cis features on mRNAs, including protein binding sites, conservation and RNA secondary structure, and use machine learning to discover novel signatures of functionally relevant cis regulatory regions. The functional impact of such sites on alternative splicing will be experimentally tested through use of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that can block or inhibit the regulatory region. I will set up a positive feedback loop where I can predict cis splice regulatory elements and immediately test their impact on splicing with ASOs, incorporating the test results back into the model to improve predictions. This system will lead to accurate prediction of cis regulatory splicing elements within any gene of interest. Accurate identification of cis elements will improve our ability to understand co-regulation of alternative splicing. The long-term vision of my research is to demystify the splicing code by clarifying the role of RNA structure in splicing and developing a powerful system to identify functional cis regulatory splicing elements and test their activity. Project Narrative Splicing is the process by which introns are removed from precursor mRNA to generate productive transcripts but, if performed incorrectly, can lead to aberrant transcripts and many human diseases. The goal of this project is to understand how RNA structure influences recognition of regulatory elements. Ultimately this research strives to identify elements within precursor mRNAs that regulate splicing and develop tools that can modulate splicing in a predictable manner, revealing more about the role of RNA splicing in disease and leading to therapeutics for splicing-related disorders.",Pre-mRNA intronic structures in trans factor binding and alternative splicing,10275711,R35GM142851,"['Adenosine', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Derivation procedure', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Excision', 'Exons', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Introns', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Precursors', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Role', 'Site', 'Spliceosome Assembly Pathway', 'Spliceosomes', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcript', 'Vision', 'Work', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'protein complex', 'tool']",NIGMS,CLEMSON UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,366211
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10124273,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'learning classifier', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2021,499995
"AlgenML: Drug target discovery platform for transcriptional reprogramming of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma AlgenML: Drug target discovery platform for transcriptional reprogramming of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma PROJECT SUMMARY Drug discovery is a laborious, time-consuming, and expensive undertaking for biopharma. Oncology is especially difficult with new drugs in clinical trials having just 3.4% probability of success. This application addresses significant challenges of traditional drug target discovery in oncology that relies on cell viability or reporter assays which oversimplifies cell state. New advancements in single-cell RNA expression profiling allows us to overcome these challenges by quantitatively mapping transcriptional dependencies in cancer cells and rapidly probing vulnerabilities to reprogram the oncogenic signaling networks. Transcription factors MYCN and MYC are to date non-druggable by small molecules despite being high value cancer drug targets as they are frequently amplified genes and drive poor outcome across the cancer spectrum. Agents that block MYCN indirectly identified from synthetic lethal viability screens have resulted in only modest or short-lived responses in ongoing clinical trials. Algen’s proprietary machine learning platform (AlgenML) identifies targets that block oncogenic transcription addiction on MYCN using single-cell RNA expression of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) gene knockdown. Genome-wide single-cell RNA expression profiling measures 10,000 genes per cell and each high- throughput assay routinely captures 160,000 cells at once. Using CRISPRi gene knockdown libraries and multiplexing the assays, hundreds of genes can be knocked down simultaneously and we single-cell RNA sequence 200 cells per CRISPRi gene knockdown. This makes for an extremely rich data set with over 400 million data points of RNA expression data which AlgenML analyzes. Our drug discovery approach is innovative because, unlike traditional approaches, the AlgenML platform does not identify essential genes that cause cell death, but rather selects drug targets in an unbiased manner whose suppression can reprogram the disease- related transcriptional dependencies. Resulting drugs should be safer and better tolerated. Here, our approach is to optimize AlgenML to monitor and reprogram MYCN transcriptional activity in new genetically defined models of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma. We focus on neuroblastoma because MYCN amplifications are common in the disease, and the genetically defined models allow detection of the precise contribution of MYCN oncogene compared to isogenic controls. In Aim 1, we define MYCN transcriptional signature, nominate target genes, and test target genes in vitro based on their ability to reprogram the MYCN transcriptional dependency. Aim 2 evaluates in vivo efficacy of target inhibition to shrink tumors and extend lifespan in new human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and rodent models of neuroblastoma from UCSF. Our team of investigators at Algen and UCSF has decades of experience in developing RNA signatures to indirectly targeting MYC and MYCN via synthetic lethality. Mature startup Algen Biotechnologies has a vibrant ecosystem of investors, innovators, and grew out of Nobel Laureate Dr. Jennifer Doudna’s lab at UC Berkeley, who has been a scientific advisor since its founding. With Dr. William Weiss at UCSF, we have assembled a powerhouse environment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Algen is developing a drug discovery platform to select and test drug targets that block the oncogenic transcriptional effects of non-druggable drivers such as MYCN. MYC and MYCN transcription factors are directly non-druggable by small molecules, despite being high value targets for drug discovery because their amplifications correlate with extremely poor prognosis across the cancer spectrum. MYCN is amplified in 25% of all neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, and marks high-risk disease with an aggressive phenotype that is resistant to chemotherapy and only a 40-50% 5-year survival rate.",AlgenML: Drug target discovery platform for transcriptional reprogramming of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma,10326006,R41GM146327,"['Address', 'Allografting', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'CRISPR interference', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Childhood Extracranial Solid Tumor', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Essential Genes', 'Expression Profiling', 'Failure', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Suppression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunocompetent', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Longevity', 'MYCN gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neural Crest', 'Neural Crest Cell', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncogenic', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Volume', 'Visualization', 'Xenograft procedure', 'addiction', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'experience', 'genetic signature', 'genetic testing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'ineffective therapies', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'molecular drug target', 'multiplex assay', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'side effect', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small molecule', 'stem cell model', 'success', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptional reprogramming', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,ALGEN BIOTECHNOLOGIES INC,R41,2021,350000
"Mechanism-based Targeting of the RNA Processing Machinery of SARS-CoV-2 ABSTRACT The massive global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality makes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) one of the deadliest viruses in recent history. It is especially noteworthy for hijacking the normal operations of human cells. To develop effective therapies, we need a better understanding of the mechanisms that permit the virus to invade cells and evade host immune restriction. SARS-CoV-2 encodes the non-structural protein (nsp)16/nsp10 protein complex that transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to 2’-OH of the first transcribing nucleotide of the viral mRNA and thus converts the Cap-0 (m7GpppA) to Cap-1 (m7GpppAm). The resulting viral mRNA mimics host cell’s mRNA. In this way, a cell cannot distinguish between its own RNA and that of the virus. This modification of the virally encoded mRNA not only tricks the immune system and helps the virus to take over the host translation machinery for synthesis of its own proteins for survival and propagation. Ablation of nsp16 activity should trigger an immune response to viral infection and limit pathogenesis. Our recent paper in Nature Communications described atomic level details of the nsp16/nsp10 complex and how the enzyme is well adapted to bind the RNA cap and exert the 2’-OH methylation. We also discovered a distant pocket (located 25Å away from the catalytic center) in nsp16 that is unique to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that this pocket in nsp16 is partially composed of amino acids that are unique to SARS-CoV-2. It can bind small molecules outside of the catalytic center. We propose to build a long- term research program aimed at deciphering the factors crucial to the maintenance of RNA genome and evasion from the host’s immune response. Our studies will reveal basic principles underlying SARS-CoV-2 RNA cap modification, the mode of nucleoprotein (NP) assembly, interplay with mRNA, and new approaches for therapeutic targeting. In Aim 1, we will resolve a series of new structures of nsp16/nsp10 proteins captured in every step of the methyl transfer by X-ray crystallography. The structural data will be validated by detailed biochemical and biophysical studies. We will resolve the biochemical and structural determinants of the assembly of viral RNA capping machinery, and identify factors underlying integrity of RNA genome. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel molecular tool to study temporal distribution of the RNA methylation during viral infection. We will examine new models for combinatorial inhibition of viral proteins by drug repurposing or novel small molecules. Finally, we will use our recently established reverse genetics approaches based on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to generate recombinant (r)SARS-CoV2 containing mutations in nsp16 to determine their contribution in viral replication in cultured cells and pathogenesis in vivo using our recently described K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). NARRATIVE The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can hijack the normal operations of human cells, which makes it especially dangerous. It encodes a set of nonstructural proteins (nsp) to protect its RNA genome from host degradation and immune restriction. Our studies will combine biochemical, structural, cellular, and genomic approaches to address fundamental questions related to RNA modification, host immune restriction, viral growth and pathogenesis, and develop new molecular tools to collectively inform new COVID- 19 treatments and protect ourselves against future coronaviral infections.",Mechanism-based Targeting of the RNA Processing Machinery of SARS-CoV-2,10240146,R01AI161363,"['2019-nCoV', 'ACE2', 'Ablation', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 therapeutics', 'COVID-19 treatment', 'Cells', 'Chiroptera', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Coronavirus', 'Crystallization', 'Cultured Cells', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Economics', 'Enzymes', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Invaded', 'Investigation', 'K-18 conjugate', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nonstructural Protein', 'Nucleoproteins', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Caps', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Folding', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Viruses', 'RNA chemical synthesis', 'RNA methylation', 'Recombinants', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virion', 'Virus', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'analog', 'base', 'betacoronavirus', 'biophysical analysis', 'combinatorial', 'convolutional neural network', 'drug candidate', 'drug repurposing', 'effective therapy', 'epidemiologic data', 'genetic approach', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'methyl group', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'reverse genetics', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'stem', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine development', 'viral RNA']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R01,2021,608161
"Characterization and modeling of m6A RNA methylation in cancer ABSTRACT The most abundant internal mRNA modification is N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and growing evidence has suggested its critical roles in cancer. However, the global patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators over large patient cohorts are not available. It remains unclear how m6A RNA modification contributes to cancer initiation/progression and how it may be used in cancer therapy. The objective is to systematically characterize the genome-wide patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators using well-characterized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient cohorts, elucidate their interactions with other molecular aberrations, and assess their potential clinical utility. The working hypothesis is that the dysregulation of m6A RNA methylation plays critical roles in cancer development and may represent potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We will pursue three specific aims: Aim #1. Generate the genome-wide profiles of m6A RNA methylation using TCGA sample cohorts. As part of an NCI Functional Proteomic Center, our team has unique access to these samples. We have developed a sensitive, robust m6A-seq protocol, and will apply it to ~1,000 patient samples from diverse cancer types, and generate high-quality, standardized m6A genome-wide profile data. Aim #2. Generate the protein expression profiles of m6A regulators using TCGA sample cohorts. Using the MD Anderson reverse-phase protein array platform, we will characterize the expression levels of ~30 protein markers (including both total and phosphorylated proteins) of 15 m6A regulators (five writers, two readers, and eight erasers) over ~8,000 samples of 31 cancer types as well as ~400 common cancer cell lines. Aim #3. Perform the integrative analysis and modeling of m6A RNA methylation data in a rich TCGA context. Using TCGA multi-dimensional molecular data, we will develop predictive models that quantify the effects of various factors involved in m6A RNA modification by deep learning. We will perform analyses to define m6A-based tumor subtypes, assess the clinical utility of m6A-related markers, and study the interactions of m6A with other molecular aberrations in diverse tumor contexts. Finally, we will build a publicly available, user-friendly database that will contain comprehensive information of the m6A data generated through Aim #1 and Aim #2. The expected outcome of this project is (i) the establishment of an integrated resource of m6A-related genomic and proteomic data based on the most widely used cancer patient cohorts, so that further investigation of such data can be conducted by the cancer research community fluently; and (ii) assessment of the biological and clinical utility of m6A RNA methylation for cancer therapy in a comprehensive way. This project is innovative because it will systematically assess the clinical relevance and functions of a key class of RNA modifications that are currently understudied in cancer research. These results will have an important positive impact because the knowledge gained will not only greatly advance our understanding of the role of m6A RNA methylation in cancer development, but also directly facilitate the development of a novel class of cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because systematic characterization of RNA modifications in large, well-characterized clinical patient cohorts is expected to advance our understanding of the molecular basis of human cancers, thereby helping the development of more effective treatment approaches.

"Specialized RNA analysis center for integrative genomic analyses ABSTRACT Projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have generated a tremendous amount of data characterizing the genomic events in cancer and highlighting the deep complexity and significant heterogeneity that can make precision medicine challenging. Molecular subtyping has helped to identify groups of samples with shared genomic characteristics that can be used for clinical decisions. RNA expression has played a strong role in molecular subtyping over the last twenty years. Integration of RNA expression data with other data types that are being generated as part of the Genome Data Analysis Network have improved our knowledge of tumorigenesis and separating driving events from passenger events. Our team has over a 20 year history of innovation in expression technologies, innovating across generations of assays and projects. We propose to apply our knowledge, experience, and methods to address the projects that will be addressed in this cooperative agreement including clinical trial samples from ALCHEMIST or the Clinical Trials Sequencing Program. We propose to address four specific areas of research including `expression/mRNA analysis', `Spatial genomics data analysis', `data integration', and “clinical outcomes.” We will provide 1) analysis of RNA sequencing and expression data, 2) normalization and analysis methods of spatial transcriptomics data, 3) integrative genomic approaches for cancer classification and characterization, and 4) analysis of biomarkers for association with clinical and other molecular features. We will provide our data to other GDACs and work collaboratively with them to integrate our analyses and generate data for sharing with the larger scientific community through the Genome Data Commons. Project Narrative Large scale, multi-platform genomic projects in translational studies are often difficult to accomplish by individual laboratories. Collaborate team science networks, like The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genome Data Analysis Network, bring together researchers with varied expertise to generate, analyze, and provide the data back to the research community for larger use and impact. We propose to provide expertise in RNA sequencing, spatial genomics, data integration, and clinical outcomes analysis as a Genome Data Analysis Center in support of the Genome Data Analysis Network.",Specialized RNA analysis center for integrative genomic analyses,10301680,U24CA264021,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood capillaries', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Commons', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Explosion', 'Eye', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Fusion', 'Generations', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunogenomics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Microarrays', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Quality Control', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer classification', 'career', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'experience', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mRNA Expression', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular subtypes', 'nano-string', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'petabyte', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'skills', 'technique development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational study', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis', 'variant detection', 'viral RNA', 'viral detection']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2021,376349
"Developing Machine Learning Models for the Analysis of Splicing Data in Large Heterogeneous Cohorts Abstract Analysis of RNA sequencing (RNASeq) data obtained from large patient cohorts can reveal transcriptomic perturbations that are associated with complex disease and facilitate the identification of disease subtypes. This is typically framed as an unsupervised learning task to discover latent structure in a matrix of RNASeq based quantification of gene expression or local splicing variations (LSVs). However, several factors make analysis of such heterogeneous data challenging. First, such datasets are comprised of samples processed at multiple institutions which might employ different sequencing protocols and quality control steps. This introduces confounding factors into the data like inconsistent sample quality or variable cell type proportions which can hinder detection of true biological signal. Second, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mutations in splice factor genes occurring in a subset of the patients may only result in alteration of a subset of coregulated splicing events. Thus, instead of measuring global similarity between samples based on all transcriptomic features, there is a need to efficiently identify “tiles”, defined by a subset of samples and splicing events with abnormal signals. Although several algorithms have been proposed for this task, they fail to overcome many of the computational challenges associated with modeling splicing data and are not well suited to handle missing values. To facilitate analysis of heterogeneous splicing datasets by reducing false positive discoveries and boosting true biological signal, we will first develop a model to correct for the effects of RNA degradation and cell type mixtures. Then in order to efficiently identify AML subtypes characterized by splicing events and account for splicing specific modeling challenges, we propose CHESSBOARD (Characterizing Heterogeneity of Expression and Splicing by Search for Blocks of Abnormalities and Outliers in RNA Datasets), a non- parametric Bayesian model for unsupervised discovery of tiles. We will apply our models to synthetic datasets and show it outperforms several baseline approaches. Next, we will show that it recovers tiles characterized by known and novel splicing aberrations which are reproducible in multiple AML patient cohorts. Finally, we will show that tiles discovered are correlated with drug response to therapeutics, pointing to the translational impact of our findings. Project Narrative: Analysis of RNA-Seq data from large patient cohorts can reveal novel biological signatures that are pivotal to advancing precision medicine, especially for the treatment of heterogeneous hematologic malignancies. However, there is a lack of computational tools to achieve this. This project will develop methods for removing the cofounding factor effects from large heterogeneous splicing datasets and improving subtype identification through multiomics integration to enable such analysis.",Developing Machine Learning Models for the Analysis of Splicing Data in Large Heterogeneous Cohorts,10315802,F31CA265218,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Institution', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'RNA', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Procurements', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Xenograft procedure', 'acute care', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'experience', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'multiple data sources', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-Gaussian model', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic tool', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,46036
