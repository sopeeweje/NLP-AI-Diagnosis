"HEPATOCYTE-DERIVED MIF: A KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a significant cause of preventable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Alcohol- related morbidity and mortality has remained constant over the past decades, and drinking rates in developed countries continue to increase. ALD is a spectrum disorder encompassing steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), cirrhosis and even progressing to liver cancer. Therapies for ALD, and specifically AH, are unchanged for 40 years as well as ineffective for a significant proportion of ALD patients. Identifying novel biomarkers of ALD progression and the development of targeted therapies is of marked interest to public health and welfare. Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF), a ubiquitously expressed regulator of innate immunity with chemokine- and cytokine-like activities, is associated with ALD in humans and in ethanol feeding models in animals. MIF is increased in circulation in AH and cirrhosis patients, MIF protein expression is robustly increased in hepatocytes of AH patients, and MIF is predictive of liver morbidity and patient mortality in AH. In animal models of ethanol feeding, MIF deficiency protects from ethanol-induced liver injury and normalizes ethanol- induced inflammation and hepatocyte ER stress. Taken together, these data identified the hepatocyte as a likely tissue source and site of action for aberrant MIF expression and downstream activity in ALD. The aim of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that that chronic, excessive alcohol increases hepatocyte MIF release that acts as a potent upstream regulator of Alcoholic Liver Disease progression through control of chemokine expression, chemokine packaging, and liver ER stress. The work proposed herein will utilize tissue-specific MIF knockouts, MIF receptor knockouts and a novel small-molecule MIF inhibitor to interrogate the role of hepatocyte-derived MIF in multiple alcohol feeding models in animals, ethanol exposure in primary hepatocyte cultures, and in human ALD patient tissues. Furthermore, the protective phenotype in MIF-deficient mice is associated with profound changes in chemokine expression in the liver and in circulating extracellular vesicles (EV). EVs are pivotal intracellular communication mediators, and the chemokine cargoes in EVs are quite dynamic in both ethanol- and MIF-dependent mechanisms. The other aim of this proposal will then transition to explore what leads to this increased hepatic MIF expression in ALD. A database search of mircoRNAs from ALD patient livers (GEO series GSE59492) revealed that a potent negative regulator of MIF expression, miR-451, is decreased along the spectrum of ALD and was selective to an alcoholic etiology of disease. The project will then expand to study EVs as a novel mechanism of therapeutic transfer in ALD, as the proposed studies will look to normalize MIF expression through restoring miR-451 expression as well as selectively inhibit MIF in the liver. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcoholic liver disease is a major socioeconomic burden in the United States with limited, ineffective therapeutic interventions. This proposal will identify a key tissue source and site of action for a pivotal upstream mediator of pathophysiological liver inflammation following ethanol exposure, macrophage migration inhibitory factor. The results will provide insights to novel therapeutic interventions and diagnostic tools to combat alcoholic liver disease.",HEPATOCYTE-DERIVED MIF: A KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE,10268259,R00AA026648,"['Abstinence', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcoholic steatohepatitis', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Blood Circulation', 'CCL2 gene', 'Cell Line', 'Chronic', 'Cirrhosis', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Encapsulated', 'Ethanol', 'Etiology', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Internet', 'Knock-out', 'Liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'MicroRNAs', 'Migration Inhibitory Factor', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Natural Immunity', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Work', 'alcohol abstinence', 'alcohol exposure', 'chemokine', 'combat', 'cytokine', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drinking', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'extracellular vesicles', 'feeding', 'human model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'liver inflammation', 'mimetics', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'prevent', 'problem drinker', 'protein expression', 'receptor', 'release factor', 'searchable database', 'small molecule', 'socioeconomics', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic candidate', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'vesicular release', 'welfare']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2021,248999
"Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients ABSTRACT The prevalence of obesity in the United States has risen to record levels over the past 40 years, putting strain on the healthcare system and creating difficult challenges for medical imaging. We propose to overcome the challenges that obesity poses to ultrasound imaging by (1) developing novel image-quality improvement techniques, and (2) implementing them on pulse-echo ultrasound imaging systems to yield high-quality images of the liver. Ultrasound imaging is uniquely affected by the presence of additional connective tissue and thick subcutaneous fat layers in overweight and obese patients; these additional subcutaneous layers greatly exacerbate reverberation and phase-aberration of the acoustic wave, leading to high levels of clutter, degraded resolution, and overall poor-quality ultrasound images. Our proposed methods will determine the local speed-of-sound in abdominal tissue layers and use this information to accomplish distributed phase-aberration correction. We also apply machine learning techniques to model and suppress the effects of reverberation clutter and speckle noise. The combination of these techniques is expected to achieve significant improvements in liver image quality. These image-quality improvement methods will be implemented on a real-time ultrasound scanner and will be evaluated in clinical imaging tasks of overweight and obese patients undergoing ultrasound surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Successful development of the proposed technology will not only enable high-quality ultrasound imaging of the liver in otherwise difficult-to-image overweight and obese patients, but also facilitate improved image quality across nearly all ultrasound imaging applications, for all populations. NARRATIVE This proposal aims to develop and test several new techniques to overcome the current limitations of ultrasound to make high-quality images in overweight and obese individuals. These novel ultrasound techniques will be initially applied to improve liver imaging in overweight and obese patients in a pilot study, though the benefits of this new high-quality imaging technology will extend to all other areas of clinical ultrasound imaging.",Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients,10236260,R01EB027100,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Cardiac', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Weight', 'clinical imaging', 'elastography', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'high body mass index', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'liver imaging', 'neural network', 'novel', 'obese patients', 'obese person', 'patient population', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'simulation', 'sound', 'subcutaneous']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,585234
"Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT ABSTRACT This proposal aims to establish a hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for precision image guidance in radiation therapy of liver cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) improves the treatment outcome over conventional fractionated radiotherapy by delivering high fractional dose in few fractions. However, SBRT of liver cancer still has high local failure rate up to 20-30% at 2-3 years and high overall grade>=3 toxicity rate up to 30% with patient deaths from the treatment. Previous studies demonstrated a strong correlation between the treatment outcome and the tumor localization accuracy of the image guidance technique used. Currently, cone beam CT (CBCT) is the most widely used imaging technique for liver SBRT. However, CBCT has extremely limited soft tissue contrast with no visualization of most liver tumors. As a result, its localization error is frequently over 6mm, and the dose coverage of tumor volume can fall below 90%, which is far from enough for tumor control. Drastically reducing localization errors is imperative to improve the outcome of liver SBRT. Combined MRI-Radiotherapy machines could provide MRI contrast for liver tumor localization. However, such machines are rare and expensive for most clinics. As such, an alternative solution is urgently required to meet the ubiquitous need of all radiation oncology departments: a solution in the form of a novel low-cost imaging system with MRI equivalent contrast. Since CBCT is readily available on most radiotherapy machines, creating CBCT-based imaging systems would be the most effective strategy. Our recent publication demonstrated the feasibility of such strategy. (Harris, Med Phys 2018) Our long-term goal is to establish the next generation of CBCT systems with virtual multi-modality imaging capabilities for high precision tumor localization and adaptive therapy in radiation therapy. In this application, our overall objective is to establish a novel system to generate hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT from CBCT, with virtual-MRI inside the liver for target localization and augmented CBCT outside the liver for healthy tissue verification. The specific aims are: (1). Establish a 3D hybrid virtual- MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in breath-hold liver SBRT without respiratory motion. (2). Establish a 4D hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in free-breathing liver SBRT with respiratory motion. (3). Optimize and clinically evaluate the systems through simulation studies and a prospective clinical trial. Our expected deliverables through the academic-industrial partnership are novel hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT systems ready to be integrated to all radiotherapy machines with only CBCT systems. This new imaging capability will have significant clinical impact because it will create a paradigm shift in image-guided radiation therapy by revolutionizing the widely used CBCT systems to enable a new era of low-cost high-precision virtual multi- modality guided radiotherapy. This precision guidance can lead to breakthrough in escalating the tumor control and minimizing the toxicities of liver SBRT as well as treatments of other sites with tumors in the soft tissue. Project Narrative The hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system will be a low-cost imaging system with superb soft tissue contrast to provide precise image guidance for liver SBRT, which paves the road to further margin reduction and dose escalation. As a result, this novel system has a great potential to enhance the tumor local control and reduce the normal tissue toxicities for all patients under liver SBRT treatments. Finally yet importantly, the hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system can also be potentially applicable for improving the image guidance precision of radiation therapy treatments of other clinical sites with tumors in the soft tissue, such as breast and prostate cancers.",Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT,10463464,R01EB028324,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Breathing', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Fractionated radiotherapy', 'Goals', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Residual state', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Volume', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'falls', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recursive neural network', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,513436
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",10140254,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,202259

"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases. Narrative Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe acute form of alcoholic liver disease with a very high mortality rate. Despite years of research, the standard-of-care and mortality rate has not changed dramatically in over 50 years. Our goal is to develop new computational and experimental methods and discover new biomarkers for AH outcome that can efficiently identify at-risk individuals. A second goal of the project is to identify molecular mechanisms of AH, which could be targeted therapeutically.",Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis,10170180,R01AA028436,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Data', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Production', 'Prognosis', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supportive care', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'acute liver injury', 'algorithm development', 'biomarker discovery', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organ injury', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,600979
"Defining Phenotypes of Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease with Acute Hepatic Decompensation Project Summary Alcohol consumption and mortality due to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) are increasing in the United States, and ALD is now the leading cause of liver transplantation. The natural history of ALD is distinct from other etiologies of liver disease, with more advanced disease at the time of presentation but also opportunity for hepatic recovery. Accurate prediction of outcome remains challenging. The proposed research will establish a prospective registry and biorepository that will evaluate the outcomes of patients with ALD and alcohol use disorder who are hospitalized with acute hepatic decompensation. This study will take a multifaceted approach, considering the biologic and psychosocial influences on clinical outcomes. Patients will be recruited during hospitalization and followed for 2 years in the outpatient clinics, with longitudinal measures of alcohol use patterns, serum biomarkers, radiographic features, nutrition, frailty/sarcopenia, and non-invasive assessments of fibrosis, inflammation, and steatosis. Specific Aims: (1) Characterize the cohort and optimize retention procedures using frequent communication, collateral contacts, and technology-based resources, (2) Identify distinct trajectories of ALD using latent class trajectory analysis and the predictors of trajectory classification, and (3) Develop a patient-specific risk prediction model to predict hepatic recovery after an acute hepatic decompensation. These project aims will identify distinct phenotypes and predictors of outcome in ALD and improve prognostication to better target interventions and allocate resources. The principal investigator (PI) is a hepatologist and clinical researcher at Stanford University, with a long-term vision of improving care for patients with ALD. Her experience with outcomes research and her Master’s in Clinical Research and Epidemiology have prepared her well to execute the project aims. The proposed research and career development plan are well-supported by a multi-disciplinary mentorship team and the institution. The PI will acquire advanced skills in longitudinal data analysis and machine learning, as well as content expertise in alcohol research, which will allow her to apply advanced statistical techniques to optimize prediction of outcome in ALD in a clinically relevant context. In addition, she will have a well-characterized ALD registry and biorepository to serve as a platform for future translational and multicenter studies. This award will provide the PI with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to develop an independent research career in ALD and improve our understanding of this serious and prevalent condition. Project Narrative Alcohol-associated liver disease represents a growing public health burden, particularly among younger age groups, women, and ethnic minorities, and is now the leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States. This project will identify predictors of outcome and improve prognostication in severely ill patients with alcohol- associated liver disease. Identifying reliable non-invasive markers that characterize the distinct phenotypes of alcohol-associated liver disease will be crucial to advance our understanding of this liver disease, target interventions, and appropriately allocate resources including liver transplantation.",Defining Phenotypes of Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease with Acute Hepatic Decompensation,10191957,K23AA029197,"['Abstinence', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Apoptotic', 'Ascites', 'Award', 'Bacterial DNA', 'Bilirubin', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Creatinine', 'Cytokeratin-18 Staining Method', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatitis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunoassay', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subgroup', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'advanced disease', 'age group', 'alcohol abstinence', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'career', 'career development', 'chemokine', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'demographics', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disease registry', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fibrogenesis', 'follow-up', 'frailty', 'genetic variant', 'hepatocyte injury', 'high risk', 'improved', 'lipidome', 'liver transplantation', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'nutrition', 'outcome prediction', 'preclinical study', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'sarcopenia', 'skills', 'sobriety', 'sociodemographic factors', 'transcriptome', 'translational study', 'urinary']",NIAAA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193536
"Rapid Motion-Robust and Easy-to-Use Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Liver Perfusion Quantification Project Summary The broad objective of this application is to develop a rapid motion-robust and easy-to-use dynamic contrast- enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) framework for liver perfusion quantification and to evaluate its performance in quantitative assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent primary malignancy in the liver. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) using gadolinium-based contrast agents is currently a cornerstone for identifying and characterizing hepatic lesions, including HCC. However, the current clinical use of liver DCE-MRI is limited to visual assessment of the pattern of perfusion in 3-4 multiphasic images (arterial, venous and delayed phases), and these images are routinely acquired during multiple breath holds. DCE-MRI also has the potential for quantitative assessment of perfusion kinetics, which can provide a deeper insight into the tumor microenvironment for non-invasive characterization of different histological features of the tumor, such as tumor angiogenesis and aggressiveness. This is particularly relevant for HCC, which is typically diagnosed based on imaging without pathological confirmation from invasive biopsy. Unfortunately, conventional liver perfusion MRI techniques suffer from a number of important limitations that restrict its clinical implementation, including (1) slow imaging speed, (2) limited spatiotemporal resolution, (3) sensitivity to motion artifacts, and (4) time-consuming quantitative perfusion analysis. Meanwhile, the need for pre-contrast T1 mapping to convert MR signal to gadolinium concentration further complicates the already-cumbersome imaging workflow. These challenges and underlying complexity have all led to non-reproducible performance of liver perfusion MRI and have significantly diminished its ultimate clinical utility. In this project, we propose to develop new rapid MRI techniques combining novel motion-robust sampling strategies and advanced reconstruction models to address these challenges. The new imaging techniques will enable motion-robust 3D T1 mapping with whole-liver coverage for efficient estimation of contrast concentration and free-breathing DCE-MRI of the liver with high spatiotemporal resolution. We will also incorporate state-of-the-art methods in deep learning to further improve imaging performance, to reduce reconstruction time, and to substantially simplify perfusion quantification. These new technical developments will be integrated into a new liver perfusion MRI framework, which will be translated into the clinical setting for assessment of HCC in an exploratory clinical study. The overall hypothesis is that with the new imaging framework developed in the project, robust high spatiotemporal resolution perfusion MRI of the liver can be achieved under free breathing, and absolute quantification of liver perfusion can be performed without user- interaction. Given the rapidly rising incidence and substantial burden of HCC in the United States, successful completion of this project would enable significant progress towards improved characterization and management of HCC and other liver diseases with high clinical impact. Project Narrative The objective of this application is to develop and evaluate a rapid motion-robust and easy-to-use dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) framework for liver perfusion quantification. This new imaging framework is expected to promote the utilization, efficacy and clinical translation of liver perfusion MRI for improved management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other diseases of high clinical impact.",Rapid Motion-Robust and Easy-to-Use Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Liver Perfusion Quantification,10297597,R01EB030549,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Biopsy', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gadolinium', 'Hepatic', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver Dysfunction', 'Liver diseases', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prognosis', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Burden', 'United States', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cancer type', 'care costs', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'contrast enhanced', 'curative treatments', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'feasibility testing', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'ineffective therapies', 'insight', 'interest', 'liver imaging', 'mortality', 'motion sensitivity', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'routine imaging', 'side effect', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NIBIB,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,464700
"Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning Project Summary/Abstract  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and throughout the world. In 2017, CLD had an age-adjusted death rate of 10.9/100,000 total population and an estimated lifetime cost of fatty liver disease alone in the U.S. of ~$222 billion. Liver fibrosis (LF) is the most important and only histologic feature known to predict outcomes from CLD. The current standard for assessing LF is biopsy, which is costly, prone to sampling error, and invasive with poor patient acceptance. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for noninvasive, highly accurate and precise diagnostic technologies for detection and quantification of LF. Our overarching objective is to apply Deep Learning (DL) methods using conventional non-elastographic magnetic resonance (MR) images, MR elastography (MRE), and clinical data to accurately detect and measure LF in children and adults with CLD, using biopsy-derived histologic data as the reference standard. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts to accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a DL framework to accurately segment liver and spleen in order to extract radiomic (gray-scale signal intensity distribution, shape and morphology, volumetry, and inter-voxel signal intensity pattern and texture) and deep features (complex abstractions of patterns non-linearly constructed throughout the transformation estimated by data-driven DL training procedures) from conventional multiparametric MRI. These features allow detection of liver and spleen structural abnormalities/tissue aberrations. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate an “ensemble” DL model (LFNet) to predict biopsy-derived LF stage and LF percentage using the integration of conventional multimodal MRI radiomic and deep features, MRE data, as well as clinical data. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate a DL model (LSNet) to quantify MRE-derived liver stiffness (LS) using conventional multiparametric MRI radiomic and deep features as well as clinical data. The proposed models will help physicians to more accurately detect and follow CLD by 1) quantifying LS from conventional MR imaging without the need for MRE; and, more importantly, 2) predicting histologic LF stage and LF percentage without the need for biopsy, while avoiding inter- radiologist variability, reducing radiologist workload, and ultimately reducing healthcare costs. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data from various scanners and sites. The techniques we develop are expected to improve medical diagnosis and prognostication in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow physicians and researchers to more accurately diagnose and quantify CLD and LF as well as permit more frequent assessments in a noninvasive, patient-centric manner, thus potentially improving patient outcomes while lowering healthcare costs. The techniques we develop also can be readily extended for the prediction of other important liver-related clinical outcomes, including impending complications such as portal hypertension, time to liver transplant/transplant listing, and mortality risk, among others. Project Narrative  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of illness and death worldwide, and it is a significant healthcare and financial burden. Liver fibrosis (LF) is a measurable feature of CLD that is important to assess the severity of disease, evaluate for progression and therapy response, and predict outcomes. We propose to apply artificial intelligence methods to noninvasive conventional magnetic resonance images and readily- available clinical data for accurate detection and quantification of LF, thus significantly impacting public health by facilitating personalized therapies without the need for liver biopsy, improved outcomes, and lower healthcare costs.",Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning,10096229,R01EB030582,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bilirubin', 'Biopsy', 'Body mass index', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Making', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fatty Liver', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Portal Hypertension', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling Errors', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spleen', 'Staging', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Vendor', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'accurate diagnosis', 'accurate diagnostics', 'chronic liver disease', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'diagnostic technologies', 'elastography', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'life time cost', 'liver biopsy', 'liver transplantation', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'non-linear transformation', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic model', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'sex']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,628266
"LIVOPT -- LIVer cirrhosis - Optimizing Prediction of Patient OuTcomes PROJECT ABSTRACT Cirrhosis is a leading cause of mortality in the United States (US), diagnosed in millions of people and resulting in over 40,000 deaths each year, predominately in older people. These patients are at higher risk of serious complications (e.g. infection, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy), hospitalization and death. Little is known about the epidemiology and disease progression and older patients are more vulnerable and might have different risk profiles. The clinical challenge is to accurately and early predict who is at highest risk for requiring hospitalization and/or death and understanding how this might be different in older versus younger adults. . One barrier to date has been the lack of an epidemiologically representative patient sample that captures those with cirrhosis and goes beyond one health system, as many data repositories are skewed or limited: CMS only captures elderly and those with debility, NIS does not allow longitudinal observation, UNOS represents less than one percent of those with cirrhosis. Hence, we will build on our previous work to use a unique dataset, the Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN). CAPriCORN captures the electronic health records (EHR) from nine health systems from 2011-present (incl. academic center, county, VA and private), catching most of the diverse patient population in the greater Chicago metropolitan area, namely ~160,000 patients with liver cirrhosis. The dataset is extensive, allowing the use of traditional (e.g., regression) and novel analytical techniques (e.g. deep learning) to pursue the aims of the study. We aim to model cirrhosis progression in the elderly and to predict the risk of hospitalization and death in older patients with cirrhosis. We also aim to perform sub-group analyses focusing on race and socioeconomic factors in the elderly. The impact of accurate and early prediction of mortality and hospitalization risk in elderly patients with cirrhosis allows for targeted interventions of the most vulnerable patients to improve outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because liver cirrhosis affects a large segment of the elderly population with high mortality and high risk for decompensation requiring resource-intensive care, yet little knowledge exists about disease progression and risk prediction. We use a large population based dataset, Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN), which captures the electronic health records (EHR) from nine health systems from 2011-present (incl. academic center, county, VA and private), catching most of the diverse patient population in a large metropolitan area, namely ~160,000 patients with liver cirrhosis.

"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",10075930,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'diagnostic technologies', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'hepatocellular injury', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,448421
"Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, there are nearly 13,000 patients waitlisted for liver transplant, yet only two-thirds will receive a transplant, and in 2018 approximately 2,500 patients died or were removed from the waitlist due to medical deterioration. This shortage of donor livers available for transplant has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are higher risk than typical donor livers but may be safely transplantable in carefully selected recipients. These include older donors (>70 years), steatotic livers, and livers procured through donation after cardiac death. Due to their riskiness, these marginal livers are often declined, yet as many as 84% of patients who died on the transplant waitlist declined one or more marginal livers prior to death. In light of this, certain waitlisted candidates might have derived a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a marginal organ rather than remaining on the waitlist (i.e. they would have survived longer after a transplant with a marginal liver than they would have survived on the waitlist). Currently, decisions about whether a particular marginal liver is suitable for a particular candidate are based on clinical gestalt or simple subgroup analysis using traditional regression models, which likely do not fully approximate the complex interactions between donor, recipient, and transplant factors. To account for this, we will utilize machine learning (which can incorporate complex, higher-order interactions) to predict whether a specific candidate would derive a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a specific marginal liver, and interview transplant candidates and surgeons to understand how best to translate these predictions into an immediately clinically-useful decision aid. To accomplish this, we will leverage Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) national data (n=293,140) and use a machine technique (random forests) to address the following aims: (1) To predict waitlist survival for waitlisted liver transplant candidates; (2) To predict post-transplant survival for liver transplant recipients of a marginal liver; and (3) To create a decision aid that compares predicted waitlist survival and predicted post-transplant survival for a specific transplant candidates with marginal liver. These aims are highly feasible given our group’s expertise in liver transplantation, analysis of national registry data, and machine learning techniques. We hypothesize that utilizing SRTR and machine learning, we can accurately predict post-transplant survival for a particular candidate with a particular marginal liver, as well as waitlist survival for that same candidate without a liver. We also hypothesize that our decision aid could be utilized in real-time to inform clinical decision-making. If the proposed aims are achieved, our decision aid could be utilized to improve clinical practice by bringing high-quality risk prediction directly to patients and transplant professionals to directly inform the real-time clinical decision of whether a candidate should undergo transplant with a marginal liver. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are far fewer donor livers available for transplant than patients who need them, which has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are riskier than typical donor livers but yet might still provide a benefit to carefully selected patients. However, the decision to use a particular marginal liver for a particular patient is based largely on clinical gestalt or traditional clinical studies, which likely do not account for the complex relationships between donor, recipient, and transplant characteristics. To optimally inform the decision to undergo transplantation with a marginal liver or not, we propose to utilize machine learning to generate personalized risk predictions of post-transplant survival with that specific marginal liver and waitlist survival without that liver, and then develop a decision aid to be used by patients and surgeons to compare predicted survival between both options.",Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation,10208791,F32DK124962,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Computing', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Survey Methodology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplant Surgeon', 'Transplantation', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'liver transplantation', 'personalized decision', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'post-transplant', 'programs', 'public health research', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'risk prediction', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'transplant registry', 'web site']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,84562
"Estrogen Administration for the Treatment of NASH in Postmenopausal Women PROJECT ABSTRACT Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease worldwide; progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis occurs in a subset of patients and is the second leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States. The factors leading to the development of NAFLD and progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including inflammation and fibrosis, are poorly understood. Moreover, there is a lack of effective therapies for these disorders. Studies in animals and humans suggest that estrogen deficiency may be an important mechanism underlying the development of NAFLD and progression to NASH. However, no prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies have examined the impact of estrogen administration on steatosis, inflammation or fibrosis in postmenopausal women with NASH. Our overall hypothesis is that low-dose, transdermal estrogen administration will decrease hepatic fat, inflammation and fibrosis in women with biopsy-proven NASH. Further, we will explore estrogen’s immune and metabolic effects in the liver, including changes at the single-cell level. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that estradiol administration will decrease fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis in women with biopsy-proven NASH. Aim 2 will determine the impact of estrogen on intrahepatic metabolic pathways and on the transcriptional landscape of intrahepatic immune cells. We hypothesize that estrogen will decrease fibrogenesis, decrease hepatic de novo lipogenesis, and increase lipid beta oxidation. These hypotheses will be tested with a rigorously designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of low-dose transdermal estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with NASH. State-of-the-art liver imaging, liver biopsies, whole liver transcriptomics and unbiased single cell RNAseq by SeqWell will be leveraged to investigate these hypotheses. We have assembled a team of investigators with extensive research experience in endocrinology (Dr. Miller), NAFLD (Dr. Corey), liver imaging (Dr. Bredella), and hepatic immunology (Dr. Lauer), which is uniquely positioned to carry out this multi-disciplinary proposal. Elucidating the effects of low-dose, transdermal estrogen administration on liver fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis has the potential to further our understanding of this disease process and identify new therapeutic targets where few currently exist.

"Digital Phenotyping of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 1  2 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  3  4 One of the most critical gaps in management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the lack of effective  5 methods of early identification in the population. The objective of this study is to leverage data and analytics to  6 improve healthcare outcomes by early detection and risk stratification of NAFLD, before onset of liver-related  7 complications. Artificial intelligence applications in large electronic health records have the potential to identify  8 disease traits before onset of disease. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that targeted screening with  9 machine-learning models applied to large integrated healthcare datasets can identify individuals with NAFLD 10 and, more specifically, those with a progressive phenotype. We will test the central hypothesis in 2 specific 11 AIMs. First, we will train a machine learning model of NAFLD prediction using multiple longitudinal data points 12 of all health-care encounters of a well-characterized population-based cohort of individuals diagnosed with 13 NAFLD in reference to individuals without NAFLD from the general population. We hypothesize that 14 unsupervised machine learning can identify complex processes and patterns without a human's guidance and 15 discover early comorbidity clusters (“latent traits” present prior to NAFLD development) that reflect a phenotype 16 at risk to develop NAFLD later in life. Second, we will test and optimize the model for the prediction of patient 17 outcomes (development of cirrhosis, liver-related complications and death) in the NAFLD cohort. We 18 hypothesize that machine learning approaches could be used to further stratify patients into subgroups with 19 different disease trajectories, with the goal of identifying those individuals at risk of progressive NAFLD and 20 liver-related outcomes. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it expands the 21 analytical toolbox beyond conventional methods to identify individuals with NAFLD using all health-encounters 22 of a large, well-characterized population-based cohort with long follow-up. This proposal is significant because 23 it addresses a critical need of identification and management of the most prevalent chronic liver disease and 24 offers a practical solution to large scale implementation of screening and risk-stratification strategies using 25 routinely collected data. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the population health in obesity- 26 associated diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will use innovative statistical methodology to improve the understanding of factors that predict an individual’s risk to develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and liver-related complications using routinely collected data available during the health care course of an individual. The development of effective and accessible tools to predict the risk of future development of liver disease will enable timely intervention to prevent the disease and reduce the burden of illness and mortality associated with obesity. Hence, the proposed research is critically important and relevant to the public health in a disease which affects a quarter of the adult population in the United States.",Digital Phenotyping of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,10188162,R03DK128127,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Cirrhosis', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'care outcomes', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'liver development', 'liver transplantation', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'population based', 'population health', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R03,2021,119250
"Liver Cirrhosis Network: Clinical Research Centers The population burden of cirrhosis is rising especially related to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcohol- induced liver disease (ALD) and in those living with HIV. The progression of cirrhosis to liver-associated clinical events (LACE) and death is related to a diverse set of systemic and hepatic factors which may be etiology- specific or agnostic. There remain gaps in knowledge in assessing how these factors interact to cause cirrhosis- progression to outcomes. This limits rational development of non-invasive tools for risk-stratification and disease-monitoring purposes as well as the ability to holistically model the development of outcomes. There is also no established etiology-agnostic approach to reduce the risk of outcomes and death. This proposal, in response to RFA-DK-20-003, addresses these unmet needs with two specific aims: Aim 1: To conduct a prospective, multicenter, observational study of patients with cirrhosis of varying etiology that serves as the foundation for conducting novel mechanistic and therapeutic studies. Patients with compensated cirrhosis of varying etiology inclusive of NASH, ALD with and without HIV will be enrolled and followed prospectively with protocol-driven data and bio-sample collection. Outcomes will be assessed prospectively by a pre-specified adjudication process. Through collaboration with external partners, we will evaluate several promising tools (e.g. spleen-stiffness measurement), circulating biomarkers (PROC3-6, ELF test) and machine-learned approaches to obtain novel insights on fibrosis, factors driving outcomes and to model outcomes. The cohort data and bio-samples will further support mechanistic studies of factors driving fibrosis and outcomes. Aim 2: To perform a multi-center prospective randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the clinical utility of atorvastatin (10 mg/day x 2 yrs) in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Patients with compensated cirrhosis of varying etiology, stratified by varices and CTP score (5 or 6) will be enrolled. The trial design uses the estimand framework proposed by the FDA (ICH E9 R1). The primary endpoint captures benefit from a patient-perspective and is defined by survival without LACE or major adverse cardiac event or need for drug withdrawal for toxicity. The primary analysis will be a comparison of proportions of patients meeting the primary endpoint. The secondary analysis of benefit is a time-to-event analysis of clinical outcomes. Several measures to track safety and de-risk the study are proposed. A benefit-risk analyses using state of the art approach is proposed. Together, they will provide robust information on the utility of atorvastatin to improve outcomes in compensated cirrhosis. The feasibility of the studies is supported by a strong and extensive referral network, a robust tele-medicine program for liver disease and research infrastructure. The studies will have a major positive impact by: (1) providing robust outcomes data, (2) supporting mechanistic studies, (3) use of innovations to refine application of NITs, (4) model clinical outcome risk to inform future monitoring strategies, and (5) provide a treatment to slow this progression, thereby providing a way to reduce the burden of cirrhosis. Cirrhosis, which is the end-stage of liver injury can lead to complications and death, but it is difficult to predict which patients are at risk and therefore, to prevent them from happening. As part of this multi-center study, we aim to collect data and samples from hundreds of patients with cirrhosis and follow them over time to better define who is at greater risk for progression. We will also participate in a trial to prevent progression of disease in which a cholesterol- lowering medication, which has positive effects on liver disease, will be compared to placebo in a large group of patients with cirrhosis.",Liver Cirrhosis Network: Clinical Research Centers,10308126,U01DK130134,"['Address', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Ascites', 'Automobile Driving', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cataloging', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Cholesterol', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Encephalopathies', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'HIV', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hepatic', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk-Benefit Assessment', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Special Population', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spleen', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Varicosity', 'Viral hepatitis', 'adjudication', 'atorvastatin', 'base', 'care burden', 'chronic liver disease', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'drug withdrawal', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'liver injury', 'longitudinal database', 'meetings', 'model development', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'prevent', 'primary endpoint', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public-private partnership', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'secondary analysis', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'trial design']",NIDDK,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,358454
"Liver Cirrhosis Network: Clinical Research Center - Mayo Clinic PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Therapies aimed at preventing development of cirrhosis-related complications are lacking. Statins have been shown to improve liver function and attenuate portal hypertension although definitive studies are lacking. Our investigative team has deep expertise in cirrhosis and portal hypertension including clinical, translational, and laboratory aspects of disease. Our aims in this proposal are: Aim 1. To conduct a prospective, multicenter, observational study of patients with compensated cirrhosis that will serve as the foundation for discovery of novel mechanistic and therapeutic targets. We will consolidate a longitudinal database to (a) provide unique information on the natural history and outcomes of cirrhosis and (b) support translational research (proposed in Aim 3). This robust multicenter dataset will be used for the development and validation of an artificial intelligence-derived algorithm for prediction of decompensation combining extensive clinical, laboratory and radiographic data, including magnetic resonance elastography and electrocardiogram. Aim 2. To perform a multicenter prospective randomized phase 3 clinical trial of simvastatin versus placebo to improve outcomes in patients with compensated cirrhosis. This aim will test the hypothesis that simvastatin is superior to placebo for reducing complications of cirrhosis and overall mortality. This phase 3 efficacy trial will randomize patients to Simvastatin 20 mg or placebo daily with median follow up of 36 months. The primary endpoint will be development of varices, decompensating events or death analyzed as ordinal outcomes based six prognostic stages. Secondary endpoints will include fibrosis regression, incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and cardiovascular complications. Aim 3. To identify novel pathogenic targets in cirrhosis progression through 2 Sub-aims: Sub-Aim 3a. To investigate the rate of telomere attrition in cirrhosis progression and decompensation. Telomere shortening has been observed in advanced cirrhosis and preclinical studies have shown reduced fibrosis with telomere length restoration. However, the rate of telomere attrition in cirrhosis and its association with disease progression remain unknown. Our proposal will serve as the basis for future studies assessing new therapies aimed at telomere length preservation in cirrhosis and effects of statins. Sub-Aim 3b. To measure circulating markers of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and its correlation to development of hepatic decompensation. Anticoagulation has been shown to reduce hepatic decompensation in a small trial of patients with cirrhosis. Our group has recently shown that NETs drive intrahepatic thrombosis, and inhibition of NETs reduces portal pressure in preclinical studies. Thus, the results of this sub-aim will serve as the foundation for future human studies investigating novel therapies aimed at disrupting NETs in the liver. Our center and team have substantial expertise in clinical trials and therapeutics for advanced liver disease and are thus well poised to conduct these studies.

"3D quantification of NASH-related liver fibrosis using open-top light-sheet microscopy Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence is estimated at >25% in the U.S., making it the most common cause of chronic liver disease. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of NAFLD, affects 1-3% of the U.S. population and is expected to double by 2030. Currently, there is no effective pharmacotherapy for NAFLD, but there are numerous promising drug candidates being evaluated in clinical trials. However, the primary endpoint for these trials, histologic fibrosis, has shortcomings including sampling error and use of a subjective five category scale to quantify a continuous variable. Our team has pioneered the use of 3D open-top light-sheet (OTLS) microscopy, which enables rapid, high-throughput imaging of large clinical samples. In combination with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, we hypothesize that 3D OTLS microscopy can provide more accurate and consistent assessment of fibrosis in liver biopsies from NASH patients. We will test this hypothesis by developing a multiplex staining protocol and machine learning analysis pipeline, which will be piloted on 20 archived FFPE liver biopsies. Results from our assay will be correlated with currently used primary and secondary outcome measures to motivate further studies with sing archived samples from clinical trials with responsivity and outcomes data. Narrative Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) affects 1-3% of the U.S. population and is expected to double by 2030. There are many promising therapeutic agents to treat NASH, but the primary outcome, histologic fibrosis assessment, is plagued by sampling error and use of a subjective five category scale to quantify a continuous variable.

"Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage ABSTRACT Despite major eradication efforts over the past century, malaria remains a significant world-wide health burden. Plasmodium vivax poses the greatest obstacle to malaria eradication due to its ability to form dormant stages within the liver, called hypnozoites. Hypnozoites can reactivate weeks to years after the initial infection, leading to relapses, and can only be targeted by two licensed drugs with extensive side effects and toxicity that limits their use. Models of disease prevalence suggest that even a modest reduction of hypnozoite abundance in the liver could make a major impact on the spread of disease. All Plasmodium parasites that have been extensively studied have been shown to rely on specific host signaling events for invasion and development through liver stage infection. These host factors represent potential targets for host-based interventions. Unfortunately, there remains a dearth of knowledge regarding the host factors that permit Plasmodium vivax liver stages to persist and develop, in large part because of technical challenges associated with growing the parasite and then monitoring host signaling events in rare infected cells. Here, we propose to overcome these challenges by using two approaches, kinase regression and digital spatial profiling, to interrogate host-driven phosphosignaling in P. vivax-infected hepatocytes, including those that harbor hypnozoites. If successful, our approach will identify host kinases that are necessary for P. vivax developing and dormant liver stages, as well as phosphosignaling that is altered by infection. These data will dramatically enhance our understanding of host factors that regulate Plasmodium vivax liver infection, and in doing so provide insight into the cellular niche that promotes liver-stage parasite development and dormancy. In addition to enhancing the understanding of this largely mysterious process, this information could inform host-directed therapies, which represent a novel approach to targeting dormant malaria parasites. NARRATIVE Malaria kills approximately half of a million people annually. One of the major hurdles to malaria eradication is the ability of Plasmodium vivax to form hypnozoites, dormant liver stages that can remain within the host for years and lead to relapses. This proposal seeks to assess host factors that change upon, and are necessary for, P. vivax developing and dormant parasites, with the long-term goal of using this information to eliminate relapsing malaria.",Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage,10170244,R21AI151344,"['Antibodies', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Onset of illness', 'Parasites', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Plasmodium yoelii', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sporozoites', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vivax Malaria', 'base', 'differential expression', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'liver infection', 'malaria infection', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'side effect', 'small hairpin RNA', 'small molecule']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,213780
"Blood pressure as a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular events in liver transplant recipients PROJECT SUMMARY One in three liver transplant recipients will experience a cardiovascular event within one year of transplant due to the effects of immunosuppression and a high prevalence of potentially modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure. However, early or intensive blood pressure-lowering may potentially cause harm in liver transplant recipients by reducing liver graft and renal function. Indeed, for liver transplant recipients, the clinical outcomes associated with blood pressure-lowering, treatment timing and treatment strategies are unknown. For this application, we assembled a team of experts in liver transplantation, cardiovascular epidemiology, hypertension, and biostatistics, in order to determine patterns of blood pressure in liver transplant recipients in the United States; quantify associations between blood pressure levels and optimal clinical outcomes in liver transplant recipients; and identify treatment strategies of liver transplant-associated hypertension that lower blood pressure and minimize cardiovascular events, using innovative statistical techniques. To achieve these goals, we will measure blood pressure using both in-office and out-of-office (7- day home blood pressure monitoring and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) approaches in a prospective, observational, cohort study of 1,268 adult liver transplant recipients, recruited from five tertiary care transplant networks (Northwestern University, University of California San Francisco, Baylor Transplant Institute, Columbia University, University of Pennsylvania) over five years. These data will be used to assess associations between the main exposure of blood pressure and the main outcome of incident cardiovascular events in liver transplant recipients. Secondary outcomes will include changes in markers of liver graft or renal function and mortality in this population. We will then merge the cohort data with the rich data contained within the electronic health record at each participating site including information on blood pressure-lowering medication prescribing patterns and comorbidity data. We will apply novel statistical techniques, including Q- learning to estimate dynamic treatment regimes in liver transplant recipients, to the merged data set to assess treatment strategies of liver transplant-associated hypertension that are differentially associated with (a) lower blood pressure and (b) lower cardiovascular events in liver transplant recipients. These data will fill a critical gap in our knowledge by precisely quantifying the associations between blood pressure levels and cardiovascular events among liver transplant recipients. We will also identify treatment strategies that are most likely to effectively reduce blood pressure as a key modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular events in liver transplant recipients. These data are essential as the ground work for future blood pressure intervention trials in liver transplant recipients. This proposal is highly relevant to NHLBI’s research mission “to reduce human disease”, through “eliminating hypertension-related cardiovascular disease,” in alignment with one of the four mission-oriented goals outlined in the 2016 NHLBI’s Strategic Vision. PROJECT NARRATIVE Liver transplantation is a high-risk, high-cost intervention for some patients with end-stage liver disease, however, 1 in 3 liver transplant recipients will experience a cardiovascular event after transplant due to the effects of immunosuppression and a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure. This project aims to precisely quantify the associations between blood pressure levels and cardiovascular events in liver transplant recipients, and to identify treatment strategies of liver transplant- associated hypertension that may lower blood pressure and minimize cardiovascular events that can then be formally tested in clinical trials. Improving the outcome of each liver transplant patient is of paramount importance to society due to the organ shortage and because enormous resources are invested into transplanting each patient.",Blood pressure as a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular events in liver transplant recipients,10094547,R56HL155093,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calcineurin inhibitor', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graft Rejection', 'High Prevalence', 'Home Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Hypotension', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Institutes', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Organ Donor', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peripheral Resistance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevalence', 'Proteinuria', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Renal function', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Steroids', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure intervention', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'circadian', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'graft function', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention cost', 'liver function', 'liver transplantation', 'masked hypertension', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'post-transplant', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'tertiary care', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R56,2021,849852
"Development of Non-Human Primate Models to Assess Immunological Mechanisms and Antigenic Targets of Protective Sporozoite (SPZ) Vaccines and Establish Superior Efficacy of Next Generation SPZ vaccines ABSTRACT Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines have shown excellent safety and vaccine efficacy (VE) in more than 25 clinical trials in Africa, Europe, and the US; Phase 3 assessment will begin in mid-2020. Our goal during the next decade is to develop, license, and deploy next generation SPZ vaccines with increased breadth, magnitude, and/or durability of VE and decreased cost of goods. Current assays and animal models do not offer an alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating whether a vaccine candidate exhibits superior performance to current SPZ vaccines. In this project we aim to develop in vitro assays and/or non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate a vaccine recipient will be protected against Pf malaria by a SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines. Success could come from increased understanding of the 1) immunological effector mechanisms of protective immunity (PI), 2) antigenic targets of PI, and/or 3) organs and cells involved in induction of the PI. Despite many studies, our understanding of these 3 areas has only modestly improved in the last 2 decades. In 2000 it was hypothesized that antigen-specific, tissue resident CD8+ T cells in the liver that recognized Pf peptides bound to class I HLA molecules on the surface of Pf-infected hepatocytes were the key cells mediating PI. This hypothesis led to a seminal study that demonstrated subcutaneous administration of PfSPZ Vaccine did not lead to induction of PfSPZ-specific, CD8+ T cells in the livers of immunized NHPs, but intravenous (IV) administration did. Based in large part on these results, a clinical trial of IV administration was initiated, and the trial showed 100% VE. Subsequently, >25 clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines have shown that empirical alteration of PfSPZ/dose, number of doses, interval between doses, and method of attenuation can improve performance of PfSPZ vaccines. However, we have learned little about mechanisms and targets of PI, or the tissues involved in induction of PI. We believe this is because the effector activity takes place in the liver, and induction of PI also takes place in the central compartment, which is inaccessible in humans. Since our last major advance came from studying the livers of immunized NHPs, we think much more information can be gleaned from this approach, including elucidation of immunological effectors and targets, and comparison and down-selection of vaccine candidates. Therefore, in this project we will develop 3 models in outbred NHPs to study SPZ vaccine-induced immunity, and use the data generated in the models and systems biology assays to establish biomarkers and groups of assays (signature) that consistently predict whether a NHP will be protected, and establish blood surrogates of tissue markers. The best assays/ biomarkers/signatures will be assessed using serum, plasma, and PBMCs from protected/unprotected subjects assessed in clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines. Finally, we will use the assays/biomarkers/signatures and model systems to screen newly developed SPZ vaccines, especially genetically altered vaccines, to down-select which should move to process development and clinical testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Malaria affects over two billion people, killing over 400,000 individuals each year mostly children in Africa. A powerful tool is needed for eliminating Plasmodium falciparum malaria from defined geographical areas. The ideal tool would be a highly effective, long-acting vaccine that prevents infection, and thereby disease and parasite transmission. There is currently no alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating that a vaccine candidate exhibits performance superior to current SPZ vaccines Therefore, in this project we will develop in vitro assays and/or non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate if a human will be protected against Pf infection by a SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines.",Development of Non-Human Primate Models to Assess Immunological Mechanisms and Antigenic Targets of Protective Sporozoite (SPZ) Vaccines and Establish Superior Efficacy of Next Generation SPZ vaccines,10086740,U01AI155354,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Amino Acids', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Aotus primate', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'Exhibits', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Geographic Locations', 'Germany', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Interferons', 'Interleukin-12', 'Intravenous', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Liver', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Organ', 'Parasites', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium falciparum vaccine', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Regimen', 'Safety', 'Seminal', 'Serum', 'Spleen', 'Sporozoite vaccine', 'Sporozoites', 'Statistical Models', 'Surface', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'asexual', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'cost', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'lymph nodes', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'protective efficacy', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'volunteer']",NIAID,"SANARIA, INC.",U01,2021,942943
"Optimization and Evaluation of Anatomical Models of Liver Radiation Response The full utilization of radiation for liver cancer is limited by uncertainty in the radiation toxicity risk for patients with underlying liver disease and the inability to compute aggregate dose in the re-treatment setting due to large anatomical changes in responses to therapy. The NCI hepatocellular cancer working group has stated that the use of radiation to downstage prior to liver transplant should be a clinical research priority. In this setting, it is essential to induce complete ablation of the macroscopic disease, which has been shown to correlate with increased disease free survival, while maintaining a low toxicity profile. Functional imaging is beginning to play a role in understanding the impact of radiation on liver function, however the translation of image-based assessments have been hampered by the inability to accurately link the serially acquired images indicating response over time with an accurate assessment of the therapy that was delivered. Early experience with dynamic multi-organ anatomical models demonstrated that deformation technologies can improve treatment design, delivery, and evaluation of the accumulated dose in both the tumor and normal tissues. However, it was noted in these investigations that currently available anatomical models were not sufficient to describe complex deformation due the therapeutic response, notably in the liver where hypertrophy is observed in areas receiving minimal dose and fibrosis/necrosis/atrophy occurs in higher dose regions. Currently, there is not a clear understanding of determinants of hypertrophy/atrophy and methods to optimize this effect.  We hypothesize that the differential anatomical changes in otherwise normal liver in response to radiation therapy of liver tumors can be described via dose-driven expansions/contractions in biomechanical models. Our preliminary data shows that these initial models can predict, a priori, the induced hypertrophy and fibrosis/necrosis/atrophy rates to within a 95% confidence interval in 80% of the cases. The sensitivity of the models to the optimization parameters indicate that additional refinement of the models can further improve this accuracy. The combination of this dose-driven expansion/contraction component of the model with the overall biomechanics describing stiffness and deformation, can facilitate safe dose-escalation to the tumor either in the definitive setting or as a bridge to transplant, enable quantitative assessment of therapy response during therapy and throughout follow up via deformable dose summation of the treatment received, and allow accurate correlation between longitudinal imaging of functional response and the delivered radiation therapy dose. IMPACT: The successful completion of this work will develop metrics to aid in the safe utilization of radiotherapy for the liver, improve correlation of functional imaging with delivered therapy, and, where necessary, enable the safe treatment of subsequent tumors in the liver, should they arise. The full utilization of radiation for liver cancer is limited by uncertainty in the radiation toxicity risk for patients with underlying liver disease and the inability to sum dose in the re-treatment setting due to large anatomical responses to therapy. We hypothesize, with support from preliminary data, that the differential anatomical changes in otherwise normal liver in response to radiation therapy of liver tumors can be described via dose- driven expansions/contractions in biomechanical models. The application of these advanced models will enable a priori prediction of normal liver hypertrophy and fibrosis/atrophy for the safe and optimal design of radiation therapy, dose summation for patients in the retreatment setting, and accurate correlation between longitudinal imaging of functional response and the delivered radiation therapy dose.",Optimization and Evaluation of Anatomical Models of Liver Radiation Response,10188461,R01CA221971,"['Ablation', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biomechanics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mechanics', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Toxicity', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Research Priority', 'Retreatment', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Sum', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'early experience', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'irradiation', 'liver function', 'liver transplantation', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'phase III trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'radiation effect', 'radiation response', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'working group']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2021,362432
"NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION ABSTRACT This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-CA-17-025. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and one of the few cancers with increasing incidence in the United States. Survival of patients with HCC is poor because most patients are diagnosed at late stages when treatment options are limited. HCC surveillance can detect cancers early and improve survival but it is inconsistently implemented. Not all liver nodules detected on surveillance imaging are malignant, these indeterminate nodules require follow up imaging to determine if they are HCC. This proposal assembles a team of specialists with complementary expertise in liver diseases, liver cancer, radiology, engineering, statistics, and information technology. The goals are to: (1) Improve HCC surveillance uptake in patients with cirrhosis by leveraging electronic medical records to remind healthcare providers and patients when they are due for screening tests; (2) Leverage analytic morphomics and machine learning to increase the detectability of HCC at an early stage; and (3) Increase detectability of HCC at an early stage using tagged HCC-specific peptides. We have worked closely together for many years and have participated/led many NIH funded clinical research networks. We have expertise and experience to carry out the proposed studies and will collaborate with other centers in the Liver Center Network to validate the methods/models we develop. We will also enroll patients with cirrhosis and collect data and specimens and provide access to existing well characterized data and specimen repositories that include both prevalent and incident HCC for Trans-Network studies. We are confident we will be able to contribute to this Liver Cancer Network and to early detection of HCC in multiple ways. SIGNIFICANCE Regular screening of patients with cirrhosis can diagnose liver cancer early and improve survival but it is inconsistently done. We assembled a team of experts with complementary expertise to increase liver cancer screening using electronic medical record system to send reminders to healthcare providers and patients. Additionally, we use two novel methods to improve our ability to differentiate malignant from benign liver nodules allowing liver cancer to be diagnosed earlier.",NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION,10229408,U01CA230669,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'GPC3 gene', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Hepatitis C', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Information Technology', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Organ', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'data repository', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'patient-level barriers', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'radiomics', 'repository', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'statistics', 'surveillance imaging', 'surveillance strategy', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,530030
"Development and Validation of Prognostic Radiomic Markers of Response and Recurrence for Patients with Colorectal Liver Metastases SUMMARY Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. More than 50% of patients with colorectal cancer will develop liver metastases in their lifetime with a dismal <10% surviving past three years. A major therapeutic problem in this disease is that no markers prognostic of hepatic recurrence or predictive of response prior to treatment are known. The goal of this research is to fill this gap by providing non-invasive and objective prognostic quantitative imaging markers for personalized treatment of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Our single-institution data support that quantitative imaging features extracted from routine CT scans predict volumetric response to systemic and regional chemotherapy and identify patients at high risk of hepatic recurrence and poor survival. Progress in developing these novel markers is limited by a lack of optimization, standardization, and validation, all critical barriers to clinical use. The objectives of this application are to develop and validate robust imaging features by standardizing image acquisition, to improve automated tools for clinical trial use, and to validate the predictive power of imaging features with external data. We have partnered with University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and GE Research, facilitating the widespread integration of the proposed technology into medical centers worldwide. Our central hypothesis is that quantitative CT-based imaging features provide novel and robust indices for predicting response, hepatic recurrence, and survival in CRLM patients. Specifically, we will (1) validate predictive and prognostic imaging features with external data, (2) prospectively assess repeatability and reproducibility of contrast-enhanced CT imaging features, and (3) develop an integrated rawdiomics pipeline by fully utilizing sinogram data. We have assembled a critical mass of experts in surgery, medical oncology, pathology, radiology, biostatistics, and image analysis. Combined with the largest clinical experience in CRLM in the western world, this application is a unique and unrivaled opportunity to define radiomics of CRLM. Integration into existing clinical workflows means that small medical centers without highly specialized radiology groups would benefit from predictive algorithms developed at two high-volume centers via a low-cost software update. Successful completion of our aims will provide validated prognostic imaging markers with a pathway to routine clinical use, which are of paramount importance to improving patient survival of this deadly disease. NARRATIVE Improvements in the resolution of CT imaging over a decade ago have created an abundance of data that contain information invisible to the human eye, which can be capitalized upon to create predictive treatment algorithms. This proposal aims to validate, optimize, and standardize our novel CT-based imaging markers that predict response to therapy, hepatic recurrence, and survival in patients with colorectal liver metastases. These findings will help us move from the “treat everyone to help a few” paradigm of cancer care to fulfill the promise of precision medicine and improve the cure rate for colorectal cancer patients.",Development and Validation of Prognostic Radiomic Markers of Response and Recurrence for Patients with Colorectal Liver Metastases,10240449,R01CA233888,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infusion procedures', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Oncology', 'Medical center', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I/II Trial', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective Studies', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recurrence', 'Regional Chemotherapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Imaging Archive', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Western World', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'colon cancer patients', 'comparative', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized medicine', 'phantom model', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,690882
"Advancing MRI technology for early diagnosis of liver metastases Abstract Liver is commonly involved in metastatic disease in colorectal cancer (CRC) and knowledge about the presence and location of these tumors affects treatment decisions. In patients with CRC, surgical or ablative treatment of liver metastases improves overall survival. Early diagnosis of colorectal metastases (i.e. while lesions are small) is expected to improve treatment outcomes by increasing the number of subjects that can undergo surgical resection or by identifying subjects early on, when non-surgical options are an alternative treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is regarded as the most effective imaging modality for the detection and characterization of liver neoplasms; T2-weighted (T2w) and T1-weighted (T1w) images - combined with administration of a gadolinium chelate agent and multi-phase dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) - are the foundational acquisitions used for the detection and characterization of liver tumors. However, challenges remain for the detection and characterization of small lesions due to factors including inadequate spatial resolution, partial volume effects, physiological motion, and variations in timing of contrast arrival in DCE imaging. In this academic-industrial partnership the scientific and engineering teams at the University of Arizona and Siemens Medical Solutions are coming together to develop robust radial MRI techniques for T2w/T2 mapping and DCE imaging of the liver to improve detection and characterization of small tumors with the goal of bringing these techniques to routine clinical practice. The proposed work is based on a radial turbo spin- echo technique pioneered by the team at the University of Arizona for abdominal imaging and a radial stack-of-stars technique with continuous acquisition for DCE imaging. The specific aims of the partnership are: Aim 1: To develop radial T2w acquisition and reconstruction techniques with efficient full coverage of the liver for small tumor detection and accurate T2 quantification for tumor characterization. Aim 2: To implement a self-navigated 3D radial stack-of-stars technique for continuous acquisition of DCE data and retrospective reconstruction of the dynamic phases. Aim 3: To conduct a clinical evaluation of the techniques from Aims 1 and 2 against conventional T2w and DCE techniques. Aim 4: To streamline translation of the new radial methods to the clinic by developing a computationally efficient reconstruction pipeline. The endpoints of our study include technical advances in MRI acquisitions that markedly overcome limitations of current liver MRI for the diagnosis of early metastases. We expect our proposal to yield technology improvements that will increase precision of care and outcomes in patients with metastatic malignancies, in particular those with colorectal cancer. Project Narrative Liver metastases are common in colorectal cancer and knowledge of number, location and size impacts precision of therapy, survival and overall costs. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is commonly used for evaluating liver metastases but detection and diagnosis of small tumors remains challenging. Our proposal is based on a collaborative integrated team of university scientists, clinician-scientists and industry engineers to develop and clinically trial new MRI technology that overcomes limitations related to imaging small liver tumors in patients.",Advancing MRI technology for early diagnosis of liver metastases,10063981,R01CA245920,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Benign', 'Breathing', 'Cessation of life', 'Chelating Agents', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resectable', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'colon cancer patients', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'liver imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized care', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,536670
