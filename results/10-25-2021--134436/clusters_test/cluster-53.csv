"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews Summary ​Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) aims to inform patient care using all available evidence. Realizing this aim in practice would require access to concise, comprehensive, and up-to-date structured summaries of the evidence relevant to a particular clinical question. Systematic reviews of biomedical literature aim to provide such summaries, and are a critical component of the EBM arsenal and modern medicine more generally. However, such reviews are extremely laborious to conduct. Furthermore, owing to the rapid expansion of the biomedical literature base, they tend to go out of date quickly as new evidence emerges. These factors hinder the practice of evidence-based care. In this renewal proposal, we seek to continue our ground-breaking efforts on developing, evaluating, and deploying novel machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) methods to automate or semi-automate the evidence synthesis process. This will extend our innovative and successful efforts developing RobotReviewer and related technologies under the current grant. Concretely, for this renewal we propose to move from extraction of clinically salient data elements from individual trials to synthesis of these elements across trials. Our first aim is to extend our ML and NLP models to produce (as one deliverable) a publicly available, continuously and automatically updated semi-structured evidence database, comprising extracted data for all evidence, both published and unpublished. Unpublished trials will be identified via trial registries. Taking this up-to-date evidence repository as a starting point, we then propose cutting-edge ML and NLP models that will generate first drafts of evidence syntheses, automatically. More specifically we propose novel neural cross-document summarization models that will capitalize on the semi-structured information automatically extracted by our existing models, in addition to article texts. These models will be deployed in a new version of RobotReviewer, called RobotReviewerLive, intended to be a prototype for “living” systematic reviews. To rigorously evaluate the practical utility of the proposed methodological innovations, we will pilot their use to support real, ongoing, exemplar living reviews. Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Narrative We propose novel machine learning and natural language processing methods that will aid biomedical literature summarization and synthesis, and thereby support the conduct of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The proposed models and technologies will motivate core methodological innovations and support real-time, up-to-date, semi-automated biomedical evidence syntheses (“systematic reviews”). Such approaches are necessary if we are to have any hope of practicing evidence-based care in our era of information overload.",Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews,10199049,R01LM012086,"['American', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Population Intervention', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'database structure', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'search engine', 'structured data', 'study characteristics', 'study population', 'success', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'usability', 'working group']",NLM,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,292031
"Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis Project Abstract (30 lines of text)  1 Systematic review and evidence mapping, both forms of research synthesis, are formal, sequential processes  2 for identifying, assessing, and integrating the primary scientific literature. These approaches, already  3 cornerstones of evidence-based medicine, have recently gained significant popularity in several other  4 disciplines including environmental, agricultural, and public health research and are increasingly utilized for  5 informed decision making by governmental organizations. It has been estimated that more than 25,000  6 systematic reviews are conducted and published annually and selecting studies for inclusion is one of the most  7 resource intensive steps for any systematic review or evidence map. In Phase I of our research plan, we have  8 developed a web-based, collaborative systematic review web application called SWIFT-Active Screener, an  9 innovative document screening tool that allows users to identify the majority of relevant articles after screening 10 only a fraction of the total number of abstracts. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional 11 research and development required to make SWIFT-Active Screener a commercial success, while also 12 building on and leveraging methods and software we have previously built to address other stages in the 13 systematic review pipeline. Therefore, one of the primary aims of our ongoing research and development is to 14 address this need by expanding the Active Screener application into an integrated platform for research 15 synthesis by uniting it with several of our other related software products. The resulting platform, which we call 16 “swift.ai,” is described in detail in “Aim 1 – Software engineering to create a unified platform for research 17 synthesis.” In “Aim 2 – Improved statistical methods for Active Screener 2.0”, we expand on the methodological 18 research completed during Phase I of this SBIR, to further develop and refine our methods. Specifically, we 19 investigate new ways to integrate state-of-the art methods in deep learning and new ways to better utilize the 20 large amounts of screening data collected from our users in order to improve our models. Finally, in “Aim 3 – 21 Living evidence maps powered by Active Screener 2.0,” we explore new approaches for using machine 22 learning to facilitate evidence mapping. Project narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a unified, web-based, collaborative, systematic review software application that integrates the latest developments in deep-learning, machine learning, natural language processing and artificial intelligence, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis,10259172,R44ES029001,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Agriculture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Elements', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Influentials', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Formulations', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'active method', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'public health research', 'research and development', 'response', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'systematic review', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R44,2021,820314
"Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities In the United States (US), an estimated 20 million adults have been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD). A major challenge for patients is to identify the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes. Patients receive care in outpatient and inpatient facilities yet quality metrics at the level of these individual facilities are not publicly available.  In the era of digital data, the Internet and peer-to-peer resources are often the first place where individuals look to find information about healthcare resources. Online reviews on sites like Google and Yelp provide narratives about healthcare facilities and assign easily interpretable star ratings ranging from one to five stars. These reviews of healthcare facilities provide information about patient experience, structure (e.g. physical education) facility, organizational characteristics, payment methods), process (e.g. diagnosis, treatment, patient and outcomes (e.g. knowledge, health-related quality of life morbidity, mortality).  Prior work has demonstrated that online ratings of hospitals correlate with ratings from the national Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Little work however has evaluated the utility of unvalidated, spontaneously generated, but widely accessible online reviews of SUD treatment facilities. These reviews could fill a niche with providing patients and their family members with useful information about the questions and experiences that are most important to them. Or these reviews could be limited and provide misinformation or only biased perspectives. To date, less is known about the potential value or usefulness of this emerging data source.  For this proposal we aim to study online reviews of SUD treatment facilities in the US to identify the areas of care that are reported as most important to patients and family members. For Aim 1, we will first extract approximately 50,000 online reviews of SUD treatment facilities and code them for themes using qualitative methodologies that involve manual coding and big data analytics using machine learning and natural language processing. We hypothesize that these online narratives will include qualitative data about patient experience and the type and quality of care (e.g. evidence-based treatments) provided at SUD treatment facilities. For Aim 2, we will then assess how star ratings differentiate facilities relative to structure and process measures reported in the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services.  Overall, emerging online data resources have the potential to provide new information about a critically vulnerable population affected by the opioid and more broadly the SUD crisis. Our project seeks to rigorously study these new patient-centric data sources viewed by millions of individuals for the purposes of better understanding the needs of patients and family members. These efforts can lay the groundwork for future work in developing measures of quality for a critically important healthcare resource, SUD treatment facilities. Narrative We aim to evaluate narratives and star ratings from online reviews to assess how this consumer generated, data can inform our understanding of care delivery for substance use disorder (SUD). Identifying the themes and measures of quality revealed in these reviews and how they relate to traditional measures of quality could inform future development of patient centric performance measures and ratings for SUD treatment facilities.",Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities,10116356,R21DA050761,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Addiction', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physical Education', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'data resource', 'digital', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'payment', 'peer', 'satisfaction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance use', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'urgent care', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2021,202917
"STABILITY' (symptomatic review during biologic therapy) Review in Inflammatory Bowel Disease PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal responds to the NOSI funding opportunity announcement for women’s complementary/alternative health approaches in IDeA states to more effectively manage women’s health. Immune-mediated diseases typically show a female preponderance and looking at all autoimmune diseases combined, 8 of 10 patients are females. Although not as prominent, gender differences in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been reported for epidemiology, disease presentation, disease course and complications, medical and surgical therapies, adherence, psychosocial functioning, and psychiatric co-disorders (Greuter et al., 2020). IBD (including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)) has significant and progressive health issues affecting women. The Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine subdivision of LSU Health Sciences Center in Shreveport serves a predominantly minority-based urban population with a large rural catchment area. Our IBD patients historically received their infusions of biologic therapy (Remicade, Cimizia) as a ‘nurse only visit’ at our infusion center. However, starting March 2019, we started having one of the GI fellows and faculty see all IBD patients during these infusion visits. These brief visits included an interview with the patient about his/her current symptoms, review of their labs and drug levels and assessed if there was need to complete any care gaps (endoscopy, abdominal imaging, vaccinations, etc.). These ‘STABILITY’ (symptomatic review during biologic therapy) visits took ~15 minutes. Based on our first preliminary study of symptomatic review during biologic infusion therapy (STABILITY) in IBD patients in this service area for the period of March 2019 to March 2020 this approach improves disease control at earlier phases and maintains patient clinical progress at reduced cost and with fewer hospitalizations. Surveyed patients expressed unanimous enthusiasm for continued STABILITY review with their doctors during infusion visits Hypothesis. Based on these preliminary findings, it is our hypothesis that very modest changes in disease review in female patients with IBD can dramatically improve their outcomes and reduce hospitalizations. Aim 1. Determine in which female patients (African-American vs. white, age group, socioeconomic status, insurance status, etc.) does ‘STABILITY’ review improve patient outcomes, their quality of life while at the same time reducing overall costs of care. Aim 2. Which clinical features of IBD (such as disease severity, CRP, calprotectin, sedimentation rate and other inflammatory biomarkers) are best improved by ‘STABILITY’ review. Aim 3. Incorporate the results of our study into the clinical decision support system providing individualized symptom management recommendations to clinicians at the point of care to improve outcomes of female IBD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE US has some of the highest rates of IBD and with majority of IBD diagnosed before the age of 30, and the impact on women’s health is profound. Our project incorporates STABILITY review to build a clinical decision support system for individualized point of care improvements that result in improved women’s patient care and outcomes. Our project is aligned with the goals of Louisiana state, incorporating data analytics and surveillance for personalized medicine.",STABILITY' (symptomatic review during biologic therapy) Review in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,10393268,P20GM103424,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Alternative Health', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Caucasians', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary Health', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Endoscopy', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Female', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Service Area', 'Health Status', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Infusion procedures', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Internal Medicine', 'Interview', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Louisiana', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marital Status', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Neurology', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pensions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rural', 'Sedimentation process', 'Severity of illness', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urban Population', 'Vaccination', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'age group', 'base', 'care costs', 'care outcomes', 'cost', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'gender difference', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infliximab', 'member', 'personalized medicine', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sex', 'symptom management', 'therapy adherence', 'trend']",NIGMS,LOUISIANA STATE UNIV A&M COL BATON ROUGE,P20,2021,292026
"Scientific Information Management and Literature-Based Evaluations for the National Toxicology Program (NTP) - Support for Scoping Activities Scoping reviews involve the summarization and categorization of literature prepared to rapidly map the key concepts, types of evidence, and gaps in research related to a defined research area by systematically searching, selecting and presenting existing knowledge. A scoping review can be undertaken as stand-alone product or in support of decision making and may involve varying degrees of synthesis of the existing knowledge. Systematic review methodology and the OHAT Approach to Systematic Review and Evidence Integration also includes the terms scoping and problem formulation as part of the decision making and planning process for a systematic review. Scoping is the process of taking an initial background knowledge on a topic under consideration and seeking input from stakeholders and clients to understand the extent of interest in an evaluation topic or nomination, assess the potential impact of conducting an evaluation, and identify related activities that may be underway. Problem formulation refers to the first step in the systematic-review process in which an explicit definition or statement is reached on what is to be evaluated in the assessment and how it is to be evaluated.
