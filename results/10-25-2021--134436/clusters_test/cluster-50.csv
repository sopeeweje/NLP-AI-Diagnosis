"Precision base editing for the treatment of motor neuron diseases Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are a class of progressive neurodegeneration disorders, often caused by minor genetic abnormalities to which motor neurons are particularly vulnerable. Because each of these diseases is rare and the molecular pathologies so diverse and unresolved, it is hard to envision a therapeutic intervention tailored to each individually, or a single treatment to effectively treat them all. Current genome editing tools are easily programmable to target discrete genomic loci and affected tissues of MNDs are largely similar. Thus, a general genome editing therapeutic strategy for MNDs fitted to each mutation could meet this urgent need.  Base editing tools can theoretically correct any C:G>T:A and A:T>G:C transition, yet the factors that determine efficiency and precision of base editing are not fully understood, and editing outcomes at a given locus are frequently unpredictable. For the development of base editing correction strategies at a great number of loci, screening through a multitude of base editor variants – currently any permutation of >10 deaminase enzymes and >15 Cas proteins, and counting – and sgRNA combinations for every target is prohibitive. A clear understanding of Cas protein, deaminase, and sequence determinants of editing outcomes is needed to facilitate the design of base editing strategies. We intend to develop a general workflow to design effective base editing strategies for causal MND SNPs and deliver these tools to MND affected tissues.  SMA is a monogenic MND with a well-defined genetic cause, and animal models harboring the human causal gene that faithfully recapitulate disease phenotypes of SMA patients. Successful development of an effective and safe SMA genome editing treatment will assist the development of similar genome editing therapeutics for other genetic MNDs, including some forms of familial ALS.  In this project we will (1) create a computational predictive model of base editing to facilitate the design of effective base editing strategies; (2) develop protocols to efficiently deliver base editing therapeutics to disease relevant tissues in mice to enable genome editing; and (3) use this pipeline to optimize a base editing therapeutic to rescue SMA in mice, and develop genome editing therapeutics for other causal MND mutations, focusing first on the most common single point mutation causal to ALS in North America, SOD1A4V.  I will take advantage of the world-class genomics environment of the Broad Institute and the expertise in AAV-delivery at the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research to realize these goals and develop skills that will help me to continue this work as an independent investigator. Through mentorship meetings and courses on grant-writing and data visualization I will improve my science-communication skills so that I may compete successfully for additional NIH R01 and R21 funding as a faculty member. By attending conferences and publishing my work I intend to establish myself as leader in the field of therapeutic genome editing for MND. Many motor neuron diseases (MNDs) such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and some forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) result from minor genetic mutations that cause damage and cell-death in a largely similar set of tissues, thus a method to genomically correct MND mutations in affected tissues could therapeutically treat MNDs of many genetic origins. Clarity on the determinants of base editing outcomes is much needed to efficiently and precisely correct disease-relevant single nucleotide mutations that are intractable to conventional base editing tools, including many MND targets such as the pathogenic SMA allele and the ALS SOD1A4V mutation. By thorough characterization of base editor variants, and establishing an effective method to deliver genome editing tools to MND relevant tissues in vivo, we will create a general pipeline to design and validate optimized base editing strategies to correct causal MND mutations for the development of a therapeutic treatment for SMA and other genetic MNDs.",Precision base editing for the treatment of motor neuron diseases,10301562,K99NS119743,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animal Model', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Award', 'BCAR1 gene', 'Cell Death', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deaminase', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Institutes', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'North America', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Serotyping', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'causal variant', 'community based research', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'embryonic stem cell', 'experimental study', 'familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'meetings', 'member', 'molecular pathology', 'molecular phenotype', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'progressive neurodegeneration', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic genome editing', 'tool', 'transversion mutation']",NINDS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2021,126495
"SWOG NCORP Research Base PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The SWOG National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base (RB) has established itself as an innovative, collaborative, and integral part of the NCI's publicly funded cooperative group enterprise. The overall mission of the SWOG NCORP RB is to rapidly design, activate and complete biologically-driven, scientifically important, and clinically meaningful studies in cancer prevention, control, and cancer care delivery, in adults, adolescents and young adults with or at risk for cancer, and to improve quality of life and quality of survivorship for those with malignancies. Over the last grant cycle, the SWOG NCORP RB exceeded expectations with regard to scientific productivity, rapid dissemination of results, inclusiveness, faculty and student training, administrative efficiency, novel and complex trial designs, and advancement of and incorporation of the patient voice into all aspects of our work. In particular, the SWOG NCORP RB opens high-impact trials and conducts and completes them efficiently. During the reporting period, we accrued a total of 11,470 patients, of which 9897 (86%) were placed onto SWOG-coordinated studies, and 1573 (14%) were SWOG sites enrolling onto non-SWOG studies. SWOG NCORP institutions provided 45% of the accrual (n=4451) to SWOG-coordinated studies. Our results are widely disseminated and have informed multiple practice symptom management and survivorship guidelines. We published results from a large number of studies conducted during the last two cycles (125 manuscripts; 58 abstracts), with 34% issued in journals with an impact factor > 10. Overall, 96 NCORP site members were represented as authors in 54 NCORP manuscripts and abstracts. Over the next grant cycle, we will continue to expand our administrative and data infrastructure, with initiatives addressing patient reported outcomes, a robust and modern data management and patient reported outcomes core, enhanced engagement with community investigators and non-traditional partners, augmented education and involvement of patient advocates, and new quality initiatives. We will expand our research efforts in healthcare disparities across all committees, and we will collaboratively design, conduct, and accrue to novel and practice changing studies, in order to reduce the burden of cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall mission of the SWOG National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program Research Base is to rapidly design, activate and complete biologically-driven, scientifically important, and clinically meaningful studies in cancer prevention, control and cancer care delivery in adults, adolescents and young adults with or at risk for cancer, and to improve quality of life and quality of survivorship for those with malignancies.",SWOG NCORP Research Base,10242832,UG1CA189974,"['Address', 'Administrative Efficiency', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Advocate', 'Basic Science', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Control Research Program', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Information Dissemination', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Oncologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational trial', 'Voice', 'Work', 'academic program', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'care delivery', 'community based participatory research', 'data infrastructure', 'data management', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'expectation', 'experience', 'faculty community', 'global health', 'health care disparity', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'programs', 'social media', 'software systems', 'student training', 'survivorship', 'symptom management', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'translational medicine', 'treatment risk', 'trial design', 'underserved minority', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,UG1,2021,6747401
