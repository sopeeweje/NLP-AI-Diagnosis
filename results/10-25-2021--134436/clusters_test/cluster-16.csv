"Multivariate methods for identifying multi-task/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers ABSTRACT: The focus of this supplement request is to leverage and reinforce our ongoing biomarker identification work with methods specifically focusing on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD). Deep learning methods that we are developing in the parent grant can produce an optimal performance based on learning end-to-end directly from the data. Our goal is to leverage models trained to classify AD from the full brain fMRI dynamics for capturing novel dynamic biomarkers of AD via trained model introspection. However, it is notoriously difficult to train models to predict directly from full brain dynamics without prior dimensionality reduction. To overcome this difficulty, we will develop self-supervised approaches that would take advantage of unrelated datasets and provide a performance boost that would allow obtaining reliable classification improvements even on small data. This improved classification directly transfers into more reliable introspection of why the model classifies subjects to AD. We plan to improve the robustness of these predictive/introspective methods and study these full-brain fMRI dynamic measures in younger adults who have CSF risk markers assessed for AD in order to evaluate the potential for leveraging such models as biomarkers of AD.

"Towards Robust Multiplex Genome Engineering Beyond CRISPR-Cas9 Supplement Application Abstract Towards Robust Multiplex Genome Engineering Beyond CRISPR-Cas9 Recent genome-wide association studies on Alzheimer’s Diseases (AD) and related dementias have provided a rich resource of AD risk genes and variants. While this bounty of information is poised to transform neurodegeneration research, we need tools to identify and validate their functions. Genome engineering tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 are valuable for such validation, allowing precise editing of AD-related genomic variants. However, current genetic engineering approaches are limited in efficiency, scalability, and have unwanted editing errors that could confound validation experiments. Moreover, we need tools with robust activities in challenging neuroscience models, beyond editing a few cell lines. Hence, building on our existing NHGRI-funded work, we will use innovative genome technologies for studying AD and related dementias, in collaboration with experts at the Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). Firstly, we will use computational simulation with experimentation to develop precision tools to edit human risk variants in AD models. We will leverage and further develop our novel CRISPR enzymes and RNA-to-DNA editing tools that we recently established based on work from the parent award (JACS. 2019). Secondly, we are developing error- free gene-editors via mining metagenomic recombination enzymes. These error-free gene-editors are capable of engineering up to multi-kilobase sequences in human stem cells and neurons (Wang et al., under review). We will use this accurate gene-editing methods to engineer large AD risk alleles in neurodegeneration models, and, working with expert collaborators, demonstrate in vivo editing. Thirdly, we are developing Turbo-seq, a single-cell perturb-seq platform leveraging machine-learning algorithms and our multi-target CRISPR screen tool for AD studies (Hughes et al., submitted). We will apply Turbo-seq to simultaneously engineer single and multiple AD-associated variants in relevant disease models, with an initial focus on APOE alleles and related protective (or causal) variants. We will determine the functional consequences when genetically engineering these AD variants compared with healthy controls, integrating single-cell profiling of RNAs and proteins. Our multi-target, scalable CRISPR tools will significantly accelerate functional study of neurodegeneration variants when considering the large number of candidates, existing and from our collaborators’ work with the Stanford Extreme Phenotypes in AD (StEP AD) cohort, and help identify potential interactions between risk alleles. Overall, our plan is to build a gene-editing and single-cell toolkit, with an accompanying data- analysis pipeline for neurodegeneration research, thereby expanding the parent award’s tool-building and resource-sharing efforts into this new focus with the supplement. Project Narrative Towards Multiplex Precision Genome Engineering Technology Beyond CRISPR As medicine advances to unravel mechanisms of complex human diseases such as neuro- degeneration, a remaining challenge is that our knowledge of the genetic and epigenetic basis of these disorders are often limited to small genome changes like single-nucleotide variants. The key bottleneck for uncover these genome black boxes is the lack the precision tools to study large genome changes. Thus, it demands new modalities of multiplexable and accurate genome engineering tools that we proposes to develop here, leveraging advances in computational modeling and genome editing, to push our ability to engineer, track, and control cellular genome, with Alzheimer’s Disease model as initial test ground.",Towards Robust Multiplex Genome Engineering Beyond CRISPR-Cas9,10287896,R35HG011316,"['Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Award', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Medicine', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cohort', 'data analysis pipeline', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'human stem cells', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,393625
"Monitoring real-world driver behavior for classification and early prediction of Alzheimer’s disease This research project tackles the NIH/NIA grand challenge of using a person's own vehicle as a passive-detection system for flagging potential age- and disease-related aberrant driving that may signal early warning signs of functional decline or incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early identification and treatment are essential steps to mitigating the growing costs and burden of AD. Our foundational advancements in quantifying driver behavior from in-vehicle systems (""Black Boxes"") and wearable sensors, and strategic analytic methods and pipelines using statistical and machine learning approaches, are directly relevant to meeting this NIH/NIA challenge. The proposal builds strategically on current project discoveries and successes that comprehensively characterized patterns of real-world driving exposure and risk in 136 older drivers across 500,000 miles driven. Under the proposal's conceptual framework, functional abilities determine specific driver behavior patterns and errors. Behaviors, in tum, index driver functional abilities and clinical features of NIA-Alzheimer's Association (AA) core clinical criteria of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (operationalized by Alzheimer's clinical syndrome [ACS]). Sleep and mobility play roles as key mediators of relationships between driver behavior and functional impairment. Accordingly, our Specific Aims (SA) are: SA1) Extract key real-world driver behavior features over a continuous, 3-month, baseline period that classify normally aging, MCI, and ACS drivers by NIA-AA core clinical criteria. SA2) Determine the extent to which real-world driver sleep and mobility factors, collected over a continuous, 3-month baseline period, mediate the relationship between extracted driver behavior and clinical features (SA1). SA3) Develop models (statistical and supervised machine learning) that combine features of driver behavior (SA 1) and real-world sleep and mobility (SA2) to detect clinical feature severity of MCI and AD and predict disease progression. To address these aims, our team of experts-in medicine, AD, driving in aging and disease, cognitive neuroscience, transportation engineering, machine learning, computer vision, and longitudinal biostatistics--will apply our approach to drivers with a broader range of impairments across the aging to AD spectrum. A total of 180 drivers, ages 65- 90 years, who have ACS (N=40), MCI (N=80), or are normally aging (N=60) based on NIA-AA clinical criteria will be studied across a 3-month baseline period of real-world naturalistic driver behavior, sleep, and mobility monitoring. Two longitudinal assessments, each 1 year apart, will comprehensively assess each driver's risk for and severity of functional decline. By extracting ""digital fingerprints"" of aberrant driver behavior in drivers al risk for AD, this project complements seismic advances in biologic diagnosis of preclinical AD and advances NIH priorities lo improve older driver safely, mobility, quality of life, with unprecedented access lo diagnostic care. Passive monitoring of real-world behavior to predict clinical status in individuals at risk for AD directly promotes interventions aimed at early treatment of and preventing progression of AD in its preclinical stages. The goal of this research project is to address the NIH and NIA's grand challenge of using a person's own vehicle as a passive-detection system for flagging potential age- and/or disease-related aberrant driving behaviors that may signal early warning signs of functional decline of Alzheimer's disease (AD), even before standard clinical tests do so. Our Specific Aims will assess and combine key factors affecting driver behavior and clinical status in aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's clinical syndrome (ACS) as markers and moderators of risk: SA 1) Extract key real-world driver behavior features over a 3-month continuous, baseline period that classify NIA-AA core clinical criteria of MCI and ACS in drivers who are normally aging (N = 60), MCI (N = 80), or ACS (N = 40); SA2) Determine the extent to which real-world driver sleep and mobility mediate the relationship between extracted driver behavior and clinical features; SA3) Develop models (statistical and supervised machine learning) that combine features of driver behavior (from SA 1) and driver sleep and mobility (from SA2) to detect early signs of MCI and AD and predict disease progression. By building on our extensive successes in the current phase, the project directly advances NIH and NIA goals lo detect early warnings signs of decline and incipient AD-with the goal of screening, identifying, and tracking individuals at risk for AD from passive-monitoring of real-world behavior to predict clinical status and progression-promoting early treatment of AD and the next stage of interventions to prevent the progression of AD even in its preclinical stages.",Monitoring real-world driver behavior for classification and early prediction of Alzheimer’s disease,10161702,R01AG017177,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weather', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cost', 'detection platform', 'digital', 'driving behavior', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'older driver', 'older patient', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'rural setting', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'urban setting', 'visual motor', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,1039678
"Roles of Gray Matter Brain Aging and Small Vessel Disease in AD Pathophysiology In this Yr16 renewal of our longitudinal study on the natural progression of AD biomarkers, the central goal remains to further understand the occurrence of asymptomatic amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau deposition and the progression to clinical cognitive impairment. This cohort has now matured to the point that there is now sufficient longitudinal follow-up to address important hypotheses that were formulated from the beginning of this study but could not be properly addressed until 10-15 years of follow-up were in place - as is the case now. In this renewal period we aim to better characterize the different roles gray matter brain aging and small vessel disease have on AD progression. Chronological age is the most salient risk factor for late-onset AD. However, it remains unclear what components of the aging process account for this risk. In this proposal, we use gray matter brain age models to study the atrophy-related components of aging and 7T vascular imaging to characterize the SVD components of aging. Aim 1 uses this estimated gray matter brain age to explain individual differences in AD biomarkers and cognitive decline. Aim 2 uses fMRI and cerebrovascular imaging at 7T to examine the role of SVD in accelerating the amyloid-induced tauopathy and neurodegeneration. Aim 3 ties together brain aging and SVD to test components of a model that small vessel disease (SVD) accelerates Tau deposition and neurodegeneration (including accelerated gray matter brain aging). Over the last 2 years we have transitioned the MR imaging of this study to a 7T MR scanner to take advantage of its high field strength for 1) characterizing small vessel morphology (e.g., early markers of cerebrovascular disease) associated with AD risk and 2) characterizing functional neural systems (fMRI). Over the course of this study we have shown that many (~25%) of cognitively unimpaired older adults have significant cerebral amyloid deposition, subsequently defined as preclinical AD. We and others have shown that in this preclinical stage, cross-sectional Ab burden is only weakly associated with objective cognitive performance. At this early disease stage, Ab burden is more strongly associated with changes in the functional connectivity, which can be measured by fMRI. We and others have identified that regional medial temporal lobe functional connectivity (MTL_FC) during memory encoding is associated with increased Ab load. In recent preliminary work, we have found that traditional markers of SVD interact with amyloid burden in their relationship to MTL_FC. Those with high Ab and high White Matter Hyperintensity (WMH) burden have particularly high regional MTL_FC. In individuals with Ab burden, SVD accelerates tau deposition, neurodegeneration, and progression of cognitive and clinical decline. The current cohort of 70 active participants will be supplemented by recruitment of additional older adults to achieve 200 baseline assessments. Individuals will undergo 3 MRI scans and 2 Ab- and tau-PET scans over a 32-month interval. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study was one of the first to demonstrate that cerebral amyloid deposition precedes cognitive decline by as much as 10-15 years. There appears to be great variability in the time from becoming amyloid positive until cognitive decline. Longitudinal studies, such as this one, which has been going on for 15 years, provide a unique opportunity to characterize the progression to Alzheimer’s disease.",Roles of Gray Matter Brain Aging and Small Vessel Disease in AD Pathophysiology,10119472,RF1AG025516,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Tauopathies', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Work', 'abeta deposition', 'age difference', 'age effect', 'aging brain', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'memory encoding', 'pre-clinical', 'processing speed', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'tau Proteins', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,RF1,2021,5546075
"A Novel Informatics System For Craniosynostosis Surgery Abstract  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, cerebral accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in senile plaques and hyper-phosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Since AD is a complex and multifactorial disease, large datasets with multiple data types have been critical to identify its risk factors. For several decades, only the allele 4 of Apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is present in about half of late-onset AD (LOAD) patients, has been convincingly demonstrated to affect risk for LOAD. However, unfortunately, current treatments are just palliative because they do not slow down or halt the disease progression. More research on biomarkers are urgently needed.  Data used in this study were obtained fromthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Currently ADNI consortium opened MRI imaging data for over 2,000 AD patients from normal, mild, moderate and severe stages. We plan to apply the AI and machine learning methods developed for craniosynostosis study in the parent R01DE027027 to the ADNI data and try to segment and reconstruct the AD imaging data, characterize the biomechanical property of brain in AD patients, and then further stratify the AD patients for better therapy. This kind of idea was never applied to AD research, which could be a potential contribution to the AD study.  Staging the AD disease is very important for design therapy strategy. There are numerous work studied imaging genetics from the ADNI data sets and biomarker based staging technologies, but none of those work studied the biomechanical property changes during the AD development. It has been observed by many researchers and physicians that AD tissues tend to be less stiff and less elastic. Hence, there is an urgent need to improve our understanding of the AD brain tissue property correlated to AD stages. Our immediate goal is to develop computational model to characterize the AD patient specific tissue elasticity and AD stages. To achieve these goals, our Specific Aims are: (1) to develop deep learning framework to obtain the brain volume and surface of AD patients; (2) to develop computational techniques for estimating sub-region tissue stiffness directly from AD imaging data; and to predict AD progression based on the biomechanical features of AD brain.  The scope of this NIA suppl. is within the scope of the parent R01DE027027 “eSuture system: A novel informatics system for craniosynostosis (CSO) surgery.” The eSuture system focuses on developing novel imaging informatics and machine leaning technologies to segment CSO imagining data, to stratify and classify CSO patients, and to characterize the biomechanical property of calvarial bone tissue with nonlinear finite element models. This project will be a substantial contribution to the public health by characterizing of the biomechanical property brain in AD patients, and then further stratify and stage the AD patients for better therapy.This project is expected to generate a new paradigm in AD tissue staging with machine learning approaches. It will advance our knowledge in biomechanical property and open up the possibility of novel treatments of AD in the future.",A Novel Informatics System For Craniosynostosis Surgery,10286746,R01DE027027,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Tissue', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Calvaria', 'Cells', 'Cerebrovascular system', 'Cerebrum', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Informatics', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mechanics', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Pathway', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Visual', 'Work', 'abeta accumulation', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'bone', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'classification algorithm', 'cognitive ability', 'deep learning', 'design', 'hyperphosphorylated tau', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'long short term memory', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mechanical properties', 'multiple data types', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'palliative', 'therapy design', 'vector']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,390000
"Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning Project Summary/Abstract In the parent R21, we are developing deep learning (DL)-based head motion estimation models, based on the PET raw data, to track head motion during a PET scan in real time without the need for external motion sensors. In this supplement, we will pursue the development of deep learning neural networks dedicated to estimating motion for Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. Brain PET imaging is highly sensitive to head motion. Problems due to head motion are exacerbated by the long duration of the scans, with scan times commonly over one hour, and by the small scale of disease-focused regions of interest, e.g., hippocampus, for AD subjects. The Yale PET Center recently acquired a set of AD PET data that includes AD patients under treatment using CT1812, a first-in-class drug that displaces Aβ oligomers bound to neuronal receptors at synapses. In the CT1812 study, AD patients underwent baseline and post-treatment scans using 11C-UCB-J and 18F-FDG. The longitudinal nature of this study requires the detection of small-scale changes in small-scale AD-related brain areas over time within the same individual. Existing Polaris Vicra motion tracking has a 5-10% failure rate, therefore, there is a compelling need to develop accurate head motion correction for this study. In this administrative supplement, we will pursue the development of DL neural networks dedicated to estimating motion for the AD PET dataset acquired under the CT1812 study, and perform rigorous evaluations. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel DL methodology to perform motion correction, which includes: (1) a DL model to generate synthetic AD PET images based on rapid back-projection images for every 1-sec frame, and (2) a second DL model to estimate the rigid motion between two synthetic AD PET images. We will evaluate our motion estimation models using the data from the twenty subjects acquired in the CT1812 study against Polaris Vicra motion tracking. In Aim 2, we will perform kinetic modeling analysis for all the CT1812 studies for both tracers. Dynamic motion corrected reconstruction will be performed using the DL estimated motion correction (from Aim 1) and be compared to reconstruction using Vicra-based motion correction. We will correlate the changes in synaptic density (11C-UCB-J), glucose metabolism (18F-FDG) and cognitive function following CT1812 treatment. We hypothesize that our proposed DL-based approach will outperform the Vicra- based approach by reducing cross-subject variations within cohorts for any quantitative PET measure in both 11C-UCB-J and 18F-FDG tracers. We also hypothesize the DL-based approach will outperform Vicra by increasing absolute correlation coefficient value for any correlation between changes in PET measures and cognitive improvement. Narrative PET imaging is invaluable in monitoring disease progression and drug treatment efficacy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. Head motion during the PET scans compromises image quality. This project will lead to the development of innovative motion correction methods for PET in order to accurately measure subtle changes in brain synapses and metabolism for patients under AD treatment over time and to accurately assess the efficacy of drug treatments.",Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning,10288215,R21EB028954,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological Processes', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Smoking', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'abeta oligomer', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'drug efficacy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'glucose metabolism', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'kinetic model', 'motion sensor', 'neural network', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'psychologic', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'statistics']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,204499
"Fine-Grained Spatial Information Extraction For Radiology Reports ABSTRACT Automated medical image classification has seen enormous performance improvements recently, particularly in radiology. The application of these approaches to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), however, has been limited due to relatively small datasets and the limited granularity of their corresponding phenotypes. The dataset size issue is problematic as the machine learning (ML) methods that have achieved such remarkable performance often require enormous amounts of labeled data for training. Furthermore, the phenotype granularity issue impedes the targeted studying of AD along the lines of what is seen in the “precision medicine” approaches to diseases such as cancer. Solutions exist, however, as an increasingly accepted means of acquiring large amounts of labeled data is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) on the free-text reports associated with an image If a radiology report describes a patient's AD-related finding, the associated image(s) can be used to train an image classifier. The parent project to this supplemental proposal (R21EB029575) proposes just such a NLP method while simultaneously solving the granularity issue by extracting fine-grained spatial information from the report. In the parent project, we are developing NLP resources and methods to improve the automated labeling of radiology images using the corresponding study reports. The parent is not specific to AD (or any disease), so this supplement will enable us to focus on this particularly important disease, which will benefit significantly from improved ML-based imaging. We will focus on MRI and PET scans. The Aims here parallel the parent project, each focusing on methods that specifically improve NLP for AD radiological indicator extraction as well as the validation of image classification from the corresponding labels. These Aims include (1) extending the spatial representation and corpus for Alzheimer's, (2) extending the NLP methods for automatic extraction, and (3) validating the AD-related labels for use in image classification. The long-term impact of this project is to substantially improve AD diagnosis by scaling up the amount of labeled data available to ML-based classifiers. The short-term goal supplement is to focus our NLP/Imaging combination research on the complex task of improving AD diagnosis. By extending our project with a specific target for AD, we will initiate a sizable research effort toward this goal. NARRATIVE This project proposes natural language processing methods for automatically extracting fine-grained spatial information—specifically related to Alzheimer's disease—from radiology reports. This will allow us to automatically annotate the image(s) associated with the report for scaling up the amount of training data available to enable state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods to better detect Alzheimer's.",Fine-Grained Spatial Information Extraction For Radiology Reports,10288320,R21EB029575,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Text', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'parent project', 'precision medicine', 'radiological imaging', 'risk prediction', 'scale up', 'spatial relationship']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2021,269607
"Alzheimer Disease Genetic Architecture in African Americans ABSTRACT A portion of the genetic component of Alzheimer disease (AD) is explained by genes identified by positional cloning, targeted gene analysis, GWAS and next generation sequencing approaches. With few notable exceptions, the functional variants in these genes and precise pathogenic mechanisms by which these variants lead to AD are unknown. The parent grant is continuing to direct our efforts on persons of African ancestry (AA), a group with a high incidence of dementia but studied much less than persons of European ancestry (EA). We will leverage rich AD-related endophenotype and other risk factor data from the largest collection of AAs assembled by the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) for genetic studies of AD to promote further discovery of AD-related genes and variants as well as their mechanisms of action leading to AD. This proposal for a Supplement to the Parent grant will greatly enhance our efforts by bringing together the aforementioned datasets and the large Million Veterans Project (MVP) dataset that is currently being developed and analyzed for AD genetics by our team. Here, we propose to identify potentially undiagnosed ADRD in the VHA by applying an existing support-vector machine (SVM) algorithm to electronic health records (EHR) of all Veterans age 65+ who lack a formal diagnosis of AD or AD-related dementia (ADRD). This algorithm requires the availability of both structured and unstructured data within EHR and can be applied to MVP participants in the future. We will also expand the current effort to develop a set of chart reviews that can be used for phenotype validation and further algorithm development and implement a report template consistent with the MVP AD/MCI Working Group. Finally, we will meta-analyze ADGC and MVP GWAS results, representing the largest AA dataset assembled to date for this purpose, for a variety of models stratified by APOE ε4 status and age to detect gene- gene (G×G) and gene-environment (G×E) interactions. Analyses will be performed separately in MVP, ADGC, ADSP and UK Biobank datasets, and the results will be combined by meta-analysis. NARRATIVE The collective findings from this project will provide a better understanding of the genetic architecture for AD in AAs, permit us to develop new hypotheses about pathogenic mechanisms leading to AD, identify proteins as targets for development of drugs to treat AD, and provide genetic markers for use in AD risk assessment and profiling subjects for clinical trials.",Alzheimer Disease Genetic Architecture in African Americans,10406019,R01AG048927,"['Administrative Supplement', 'African', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Award', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Electronic Health Record', 'European', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Grant', 'Incidence', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Proxy', 'Reporting', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Structure', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'algorithm development', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'biobank', 'case control', 'cohort', 'drug development', 'endophenotype', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genotypic sex', 'next generation sequencing', 'parent grant', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'positional cloning', 'structured data', 'support vector machine', 'unstructured data', 'working group']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,414376
"Genome Center for Alzheimer's Disease (GCAD) Overall Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects 5.8 million people in the United States, and is an immense burden on patients, caregivers and on the economy. No disease-modifying treatments or preventions exist, and we need better understanding of the disease and new therapeutic strategies. Genetic discoveries are one source of candidate therapeutic targets. One source of genetic targets is the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), a National Institute on Aging (NIA) initiative since 2012 to sequence genomes and exomes of AD subjects and cognitively normal elderly controls. The Genome Center for Alzheimer’s Disease (GCAD) is the analysis coordinating center for the ADSP. In the previous grant cycle, GCAD processed all AD-relevant sequencing data producing harmonized genetic data for AD research. This renewal responds to the increase in the amount and complexity of ADSP sequence data, the collection of new types of data, and an expansion of the types of analysis being performed. In addition to sequence data, GCAD will harmonize functional genomics data. GCAD will provide fully quality-controlled and annotated genetic and functional genomics data that is analysis ready. In addition to AD, GCAD will also work with data for AD related disorders (ADRD). These include frontotemporal dementias (FTDs), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), and Parkinson’s disease with dementia (PD-d). In the Y6-10 funding period, GCAD will assemble and harmonize whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing data, and provide it to ADSP investigators and the general scientific community. GCAD will work with US and non-US groups to analyze data by fostering a collaborative environment, and providing infrastructure support. GCAD will also assemble and harmonize functional genomics data which will be integral to identifying genes as candidate drug targets. The research plan will lead to a high quality, comprehensive, harmonized collection of genetic and functional data with detailed supporting resources including documentation and optimized computer codes. This resource will be invaluable for the entire AD research community. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a serious public health issue without treatment, although scientists are making genetic discoveries that could lead to new therapeutic strategies. In the Y6-10 funding period, GCAD will assemble and harmonize sequencing data from more than 80,000 genomes as a community resource, and coordinate analysis of these data. GCAD will also assemble and harmonize functional genomics data which will be integral to identifying genes as candidate drug targets.",Genome Center for Alzheimer's Disease (GCAD),10090891,U54AG052427,"['ATAC-seq', 'Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asians', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Caribbean Hispanic', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hi-C', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'LGR5 gene', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Conformation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Systems Analysis', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive system', 'collaborative environment', 'computer code', 'computing resources', 'corticobasal degeneration', 'data repository', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drug candidate', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'file format', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'genomic data', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'metabolomics', 'neural network', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'phenotypic data', 'prevent', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'reference genome', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U54,2021,4179221
"Multi-Modality Image Data Fusion and Machine Learning Approaches for Personalized Diagnostics and Prognostics of MCI due to AD Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease. The greatest treatment potential lies in early stages before irreversible brain damage occurs. Early treatment requires early detection of the disease. Imaging holds great promise for capturing early signs of AD. This capability can be substantially strengthened by integrating neuroimages of different modalities that characterize brain structure and function from complementary aspects. However, although various machine learning (ML) algorithms have been developed to integrate multi-modality images for diagnosis and prognosis of AD, there is a lack of novel, robust, effective algorithms to address patient-wise missing modalities in the integration. In real clinical data, it is inevitable that some image modalities are unavailable to some patients due to high cost, insurance coverage, and safety constraints. Thus, the existing algorithms may only work for a small portion of patients who have complete modalities. This significantly reduces the access to advanced imaging-based diagnostic systems from the general patient population and in broad clinical settings. Because of the limited clinical utility, it is difficult to commercialize the existing ML algorithms into clinical systems/products, whereas the current imaging-based products on the market focus on single image modalities or image measurement, processing, visualization, and statistical analysis (without advanced ML capabilities). To fill the unmet market niche, this STTR Phase II project will develop the first-ever broadly-applicable clinical decision support system, Multi-neuroimaging for Detecting AD (Mind-AD), which can accommodate varying availability of image modalities across different patients to build classifiers and provide accurate diagnosis and prognosis of AD for each individual at the early MCI stage. Our Phase I has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the Mind-AD system. At Phase II, we propose functional optimization and validation of Mind-AD in three aims. Aim 1 will optimize the accuracy and robustness of the diagnostic/prognostic models by integrating our Phase I IMTL model with efficient PSO feature selection. The integrated IMTL-PSO is very efficient in selecting optimal feature subsets to yield accurate, robust diagnostic/prognostic models especially on independent validation datasets. Aim 2 will develop a novel IMTL- DL (deep learning) model to integrate incomplete multi-modality volumetric images. While IMTL-PSO is based on features defined using anatomical knowledge of the brain, IMTL-DL extracts features in a data-driven manner. Aim 3 will integrate IMTL-PSO and IMTL-DL through decision fusion to best leverage their complementary, joint strength, and validate the resulting Mind-AD system using two independent datasets. Our project is significant because Mind-AD is the first early diagnostic/prognostic system for AD using advanced ML algorithms to integrate incomplete multi-modality image datasets. Mind-AD will facilitate early detection, early intervention, patient selection in drug trials targeting the early stage, and will help achieve these goals in in broad clinical settings due to the capability of accommodating varying availability of image modalities from different patients. The public health relevance of this project is to provide a clinical decision support system, Mind-AD, to facilitate accurate diagnosis and prognosis of AD at the early stage, through novel machine learning integration of multi- modality image datasets with patient-specific missing modalities. Early detection and early intervention bear the greatest potential for combating this devastating disease. Therefore, our system helps address the serious public health concern regarding AD which currently affects over 5.5 million people and incurs over $200 billion health care cost per year in the US.",Multi-Modality Image Data Fusion and Machine Learning Approaches for Personalized Diagnostics and Prognostics of MCI due to AD,10264079,R42AG053149,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Family health status', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prognosis', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'data fusion', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'diagnostic platform', 'feature extraction', 'feature selection', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'particle', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'prognostic model', 'public health relevance', 'search engine', 'targeted therapy trials', 'therapy development', 'trend']",NIA,MS TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION,R42,2021,1219743
"Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology 7. Project Summary/Abstract  In Alzheimer's disease (AD), irreversible neurological damage takes place years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is recognized that the development of AD dementia treatment and prevention strategies relies on the early detection of presymptomatic pathology. Previous studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD and precedes the formation of plaques and tangles that are hallmarks of this disease. The premise of this study is based on the unique sensitivity of the brain to systemic bioenergetic decline due to its exceptionally high metabolic demand. We hypothesize that bioenergetic capacity is related to early AD pathology and that bioenergetic decline is associated with the long term progression and severity of this disease. Recent work by our group and others demonstrate that blood- based bioenergetic profiling, utilizing cellular respirometry, provides a reliable measure of systemic mitochondrial function. The proposed study will determine whether blood cell bioenergetics is related to AD risk, pathology, cognitive performance, and changes in these parameters over time. Our long term goal is to develop a minimally invasive screening tool that can be used in a clinic/community setting to identify candidates for more intensive diagnostic testing, such as CSF biomarker analysis and brain imaging.  This project will be completed in an efficient and cost-effective manner by leveraging resources provided by the NIA-funded Wake Forest Alzheimer' Disease Center Clinical Core (ADCCC). Participants in the ADCCC represent a spectrum of AD risk and disease progression and are being extensively characterized for AD pathologies at baseline and 3 year follow ups. Our preliminary data from ADCCC participants indicate that bioenergetic capacity, measured in blood cells, is lower in participants with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, our data suggest that bioenergetic deficits are already apparent in cognitively normal participants at high risk for AD. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) To determine bioenergetic profiles most strongly associated with AD risk and reporters of AD pathology (cognitive performance, CSF Aβ42/tau, hippocampal volume, brain amyloid, and cerebral glucose metabolism); 2) To determine the changes in bioenergetic profiles related to the 3 year progression of cognitive decline and reporters of AD pathology; and, 3) To determine the relationships of mitochondrial content and inflammation with bioenergetic capacity, and reporters of AD pathology at baseline and at follow-up. A central goal of the proposed study is to determine the specific bioenergetic parameters that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Therefore, in addition to convention analytical approaches, we will employ state of the art Machine Learning analyses to identify individual parameters or multivariate signatures that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Completion of this project can impact the detection of presymptomatic AD, provide insights into mechanisms underlying bioenergetic decline associated with AD, and broadly advance translational bioenergetics research. 8. Project Narrative  It is widely recognized that the implementation of successful Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment strategies rely on the identification of patients at risk for developing the disease. The proposed project will examine blood based bioenergetic profiling as a minimally invasive strategy for determining Alzheimer's disease risk and presymptomatic pathology. The completion of our study aims will advance the development of an affordable screening tool that can be utilized in a clinical/community setting to identify individuals who are candidates for comprehensive diagnostic testing.",Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology,10174646,R01AG054523,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrum', 'Citrate (si)-Synthase', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cost Measures', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical center', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'community clinic', 'community setting', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'glucose metabolism', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'ketogenic diet', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'minimally invasive', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'stem', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,746785
"Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. While research efforts continue to focus on the causes of AD and to develop effective medical treatments, there is also a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. There may be subtle changes in brain and cognitive function that are detectable before major symptoms emerge. One approach for characterizing these vulnerabilities is the use of functional and structural neuroimaging to identify risk profiles for AD. The present study proposes and tests a model of AD pathology using neuroimaging network analysis and machine learning approaches to provide insight on widespread changes in information processing in the AD brain. The proposed model hypothesizes that some aspects of network information processing reflect neurodegeneration and cognitive decline associated with AD pathology (e.g., hub connectivity and global connectivity) whereas other network properties reflect attempts to compensate for compromised information processing (e.g., diffusion of information). In addition, this proposal compares the efficacy of models with respect to discriminating diagnostic categories (e.g., machine learning classification of AD and clinically normal subjects) versus isolating underlying dimensions of AD cognitive decline (e.g., machine learning prediction of memory and language scores from network features). Finally, this study will determine whether features of AD pathology are present in an at-risk sample of subjects; namely, individuals diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). This will be examined by transferring the AD network models to aMCI subjects and testing whether the model can discriminate aMCI from clinically normal matched controls and whether the model can predict scores on cognitive tests. The analytic approach will using resting state fMRI data as a primary assay of network integrity, but diffusion imaging and task fMRI data will also be examined in an exploratory aim. The general approach will recruit individuals with AD, aMCI and clinically normal matched controls for each diagnostic group. The groups that are compared directly will be matched for amyloid status, as indicated by florbetapir PET imaging. The novel contributions of this project include (a) testing a network model of AD pathology that unifies various measures of network functioning, (b) comparing efficacy of modeling with respect to delineating diagnostic categories versus capturing underlying cognitive dimensions of AD, and (c) transferring the AD model to an at-risk group to assess disease vulnerability. This latter innovation can be applied in future studies to any group of subjects that is defined at risk, such as those with genetic vulnerability or positive family history. The present study also sets the stage for a subsequent longitudinal follow-up study to validate whether individuals identified at risk using network modeling actually convert to AD. Ultimately, network modeling of this sort may be used as a relatively less expensive and less invasive biomarker than PET imaging, which could lead to earlier treatments and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years, there is a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. The present study will use neuroimaging to examine brain connectivity and determine whether some aspects of altered connectivity are present in individuals who are at risk for AD: individuals who have mild cognitive impairment. This approach could be used in the future to possibly detect risk for AD before any cognitive symptoms emerge, thereby enabling earlier treatment and intervention to combat the devastating cognitive, social and financial consequences of AD.",Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease,10189467,R01AG055132,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Financial compensation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Center for Health Statistics', 'Well in self', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'combat', 'comparative efficacy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'efficacy testing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'recruit', 'response', 'social']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2021,732130
"The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering, disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Genomic studies for late-onset AD (LOAD) have identified over 20 risk loci; however, translating the relevant molecules identified by genomics to AD-specific mechanistic pathways has been challenging. Our application, entitled “The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline Revealed by Next- Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,” is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing a uniquely innovative molecular imaging platform called multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) that will determine high dimensional protein interactions for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomics studies in normal and pathological states. Our proposal has three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to analyze four regions in healthy aged brains: two sectors of the hippocampal pyramidal layer and from two isocortical regions. Next- generation MIBI instrumentation will be used to image simultaneously 30+ proteins that mark subtypes of neurons, synapses, and non-neuronal cells, while covering regulatory signaling, neuro-inflammatory components, and AD risk gene protein products with subcellular resolution. In Aim 2, we propose to use the same multiplexed imaging methods in AD brain stratified by APOE genotype. We will analyze these data with statistical machine learning methods already established in our laboratory, similar to what we have done previously with different cancers and the immune system. In Aim 3, using infrastructure we have already have established, we will create a web-based portal where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi- color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features we derive shared freely. We propose a transformative, collaborative approach to AD that leverages a long-standing NIA-funded longitudinal cohort and is highly responsive to the National Alzheimer's Plan. These novel insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets and will create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD. Project Narrative AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to generate a phenotypic landscape of cognitive decline, to understand modulation of cognitive decline during compensation and relate genetic predisposition to changes in phenotypic landscape defined by muti-parametric measurements using enabling technologies like multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI).  ",The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,10173583,R01AG056287,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cessation of life', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Electrons', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Middle frontal gyrus structure', 'Molecular', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'burden of illness', 'collaborative approach', 'computational pipelines', 'data repository', 'data sharing', 'disability', 'gene product', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning method', 'mental state', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'multiplexed imaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive signature', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'symposium', 'web portal']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,502002
"Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS) Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population. Clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET- positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS) will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients will be assessed at three time points – baseline (both EOAD and controls), 12 months (EOAD all measures; controls – clinical and cognitive measures only) and 24 months (EOAD, all measures except PET). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD, and compare to a matched sample of LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population. Project Narrative Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), occurring before age 65, are an understudied segment of the population of patients with AD, and many treatment studies exclude these younger individuals. In this project, we plan to recruit and follow more than 400 people with EOAD in order to better understand changes in thinking abilities, changes in the brain, and changes in blood and spinal fluid, with the goal of using this information to design new treatment trials inclusive of this segment of the AD population.",Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS),10233958,U01AG057195,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Language', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Presenile Alzheimer Dementia', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Procedures', 'Psychometrics', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'age related', 'autosomal dominant Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'biomarker development', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical outcome measures', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'disorder control', 'genetic risk factor', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'presenilin-1', 'recruit', 'risk variant', 'serial imaging', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment trial', 'unethical']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2021,16618207

Participants in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS) will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). EOnonAD participants and controls will also receive [18]FDG PET. All participants are followed annually (controls up to 24 months; impaired participants up to 48 months). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD and EOnonAD and compare to age-matched controls and sex and stage- matched LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. Additionally, we will characterize demographic, clinical, neuroimaging, and fluid biomarker measures in EOnonAD cases to explore the possible etiologies of cognitive impairment. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population. Project Narrative Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), occurring before age 65, are an understudied segment of the population of patients with AD, and many treatment studies exclude these younger individuals. In this project, we plan to recruit and follow 600 people with EOAD and related disorders in order to better understand changes in thinking abilities, changes in the brain, and changes in blood and spinal fluid, with the goal of using this information to design new treatment trials inclusive of this segment of the AD population.",Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS),10219685,U01AG057195,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Atrophic', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Italy', 'Language', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Presenile Alzheimer Dementia', 'Psychometrics', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'autosomal dominant Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'biomarker development', 'brain tissue', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical outcome measures', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'genetic risk factor', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'neurofilament', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'presenilin-1', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment trial']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2021,1072053
"Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural systems pharmacology. Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple health threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, efforts in drug discovery and repurposing for the treatment of AD have had limited success. The failure is largely attributed to the adoption of a reductionist model of “one-drug-one-gene- one-disease”. As AD is a multi-facet complex disease, a new treatment approach is urgently needed to simultaneously target multiple pathological processes responsible for the onset and progress of AD, some of which are also common to other diseases that cause dementia. In this application, we will develop an innovative translational bioinformatics approach to addressing challenges in AD drug discovery. Our approach is based on a new paradigm of systems pharmacology, which focuses on defining multiple targets to a single drug or a drug combination, and studying the effect of the drug(s) on perturbing disease-causing networks. Over the last ten years, we have developed a novel structural systems pharmacology (SSP) platform that can predict genome-wide high-resolution protein-chemical interactions and correlate molecular interactions with phenotype responses. The SSP platform synergistically combines novel methods from machine learning, bioinformatics, biophysics, and systems biology. We have successfully applied the SSP platform to drug repurposing, polypharmacology, side effect prediction, precision medicine, and Genome-Wide Association Studies. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies, and in close collaborations with experimental laboratories, we will develop, and rigorously test a novel SSP approach to AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology. Firstly, we will develop a drug-gene-disease multi-layered network model (MULAN) that links FDA-approved drugs with neurodegenerative diseases through protein-chemical interactions, gene- disease associations, and chemical-disease associations through integrating multiple omics data. Secondly, we will improve and apply our proven successful SSP platform, which can accurately infer novel relations from sparse and noisy MULAN, to identify safe FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed for AD treatment. Finally, we will experimentally test FDA-approved drugs identified for their binding activity of drug targets and anti-AD potency in cell and animal models. The successful completion of this project will provide an integrated computational modeling framework for AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology as well as identify novel targeted anti-AD therapeutics toward pre-clinical trials. Relevance Statement Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, AD is a complex disease that has been extremely hard to treat with the conventional approach. New methods that can reuse old drugs to target mulple pathological processes in AD may provide new solutions to effective AD treatment.",Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural systems pharmacology.,10147838,R01AG057555,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biophysics', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diazoxide', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Human', 'Inflammation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'clinical application', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug repurposing', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical development', 'preclinical trial', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutically effective', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,HUNTER COLLEGE,R01,2021,779392
"Systematic Alzheimer's disease drug repositioning (SMART) based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening and image-omics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the complexity of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis and the associated co-morbid conditions, both the “depth” and the “width” of currently available drug repurposing solutions need to be improved in order to deliver effective AD therapeutic solutions. The depth of a drug-repurposing project refers to the level of understanding of disease mechanism and drug-target interactions across a wide searching space for the combination of dosage and treatment time. Achieving depth requires a reliable AD model system that comprehensively recapitulates AD pathogenesis in a human brain-like environment, and sophisticated transcriptomic profiles, which can reveal molecular-level changes underlying disease-reversing phenotypes across multiple treatment conditions. The width of a therapy search relies on the efficacy of predicting and validating effects of candidate compounds from an enormous search space. Width can be achieved from novel computational algorithms connecting –omics changes with phenotypic changes, thus guiding the search with improved knowledge on mechanisms and avoiding exhaustive testing of every available drug. Integrating the systems medicine and drug repositioning expertise of the Wong Lab at the Houston Methodist Research Institute of Houston Methodist Hospital with the Alzheimer's biology expertise of the Kim and Tanzi labs at Massachusetts General Hospital, we propose a SysteMatic Alzheimer's disease drug ReposiTioning (SMART) framework based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening. Reformatting a novel three- dimensional human neural stem cell culture model of AD (a.k.a. Alzheimer's in a dish) developed in the Kim and Tanzi labs for high content screening, the Wong lab screened 2,640 known drugs and bioactive compounds and obtained a panel of 38 primary hits that strongly inhibit β-amyloid-driven p-tau accumulation. We hypothesize that iteratively running relatively small screens with our novel 3D cell model and applying systematic artificial intelligence modeling to the transcriptomic profiles of the screening hits will allow us to: 1) quickly obtain a panel of robust novel drug candidates for AD, and 2) gain an in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms from those repositioned drug candidates, which will subsequently improve the success rate of predicting novel hits. Using the primary 38 hits as a starting point, the SMART computational modules will update the existing NeuriteIQ software package to quantify the image data from high content screening; it will also incorporate publicly available big data transcriptomic profiles to predict candidate compounds inducing similar pathway changes as those original compounds, effectively expanding the search width to tens of thousands of compounds while only requiring functional validation of less than 100 drug candidates. The validated predictions will, in turn, add to the panel of known hits that will launch the next round of computational predictions and experimental validations, efficiently generating candidates for novel AD therapies (Aim 1). SMART's iterative prediction-validation scheme effectively connects more transcriptomic profiles to desirable phenotypic changes. Thus, we will apply systematic image-omics modeling to uncover novel mechanisms driving such phenotypes. For all the validated hits, dose-responses for the phenotype of pTau inhibition will be obtained using the 3D culture model; while the dose-responses for individual genes and pathways will be modeled through public and in-house generated transcriptomic profiles. We will use Partial Least Square Regression models to identify gene modules with matching dose-response curves as the phenotypes, thus allowing us to go beyond the confinement of canonical pathway maps and identify novel functional modules specifically related to phenotypes of interest (Aim 2). Selected compounds derived from the previous two aims will be evaluated in human neurons directly derived from AD patients and in animal models (Aim 3). Success of this work will lead to new AD therapeutic compounds ready for translation into clinical trials, as well as a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the SMART framework for drug repositioning will be generalizable to other big data and disease platforms. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Alzheimer's Disease (AD) currently afflicts 5.3 million people in the United States alone. Beyond symptomatic treatments, no clear therapeutic options are available. The proposed study provides a systematic drug repositioning strategy that uses a novel 3D human neural culture model (Alzheimer's-in-a-dish) integrated with a computational platform that leverages publicly available toxicology and pharmokinetic big data. Success of the study will greatly reduce the cost of AD drug development, identify potential new disease mechanism, and facilitate quicker translation from bench to bedside. .",Systematic Alzheimer's disease drug repositioning (SMART) based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening and image-omics,10173590,R01AG057635,"['3-Dimensional', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Methodist Church', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Institute', 'Running', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Width', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'comorbidity', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'drug repurposing', 'exhaustion', 'feeding', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'individual response', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'nerve stem cell', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'symptom treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tau-1', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,689643
"In Silico Screening of Medications for Slowing Alzheimer's Disease Progression. Drug development in Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires a considerable investment of time and re- sources, often with little reward as the vast majority of medications ultimately prove unsuccessful. Drug repur- posing, in which medications that already have been approved for treatment are evaluated for therapeutic effects in other disorders, has the potential to markedly increase the number of agents in the drug development pipeline but requires methods for effective screening of candidate medications for activity. In silico or computational ap- proaches to medication screening are rapidly growing, and have been successful in illnesses such as cancer, but their application to AD remains understudied. There is also intense interest in drug repurposing approaches that will utilize the vast amounts of clinical data that are being collected from epidemiological studies and clinical encounters documented through electronic health records (EHRs). In this proposal, we present a novel approach to drug repurposing that uses large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms applied to concurrent medication taken by participants in AD clinical trials and in Medicare administrative data to determine which of these medications show potential therapeutic beneﬁts. With over 30 years of AD clinical trial data available to us through a recently developed meta-database and 10 years of prescription data available through Medicare Part D, the administration of concurrent medications to patients as part of their routine clinical care constitutes a large- scale natural experiment. This information can be harnessed for AD treatment discovery if appropriate methods can be developed to detect effects on disease progression within this high-dimensional data. Data mining al- gorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale screening for drug repurposing. Using our meta-database and Medicare data, we will be able to evaluate most of the more than 6,000 currently available prescription medications for efﬁcacy in AD using well-accepted endpoints for measuring disease progression. The discovery phase will be followed by a validation phase of promising candidate medications in independent data sets, as well as identiﬁcation of plausible gene targets for each medication from the biomedical literature. This study will set the groundwork for a series of follow-up in vivo studies to conclusively demonstrate effects of selected medications for AD, expanding the current armamentarium for treating this common and debilitating disorder. In this proposal, we will explore drug repurposing, in which medications approved to treat other illnesses are evaluated for potential beneﬁts in Alzheimer's disease (AD), to improve the efﬁciency of the drug development process, which currently ends in failure for most candidate medications despite considerable investment of both time and resources. We will apply data mining, or pattern recognition, algorithms to the concomitant medications taken by subjects in previous AD clinical trials that are part of our meta-database of more than 6,500 individuals and by participants in Medicare Part D with more than 787,000 individuals. This approach will allow us to screen hundreds of drugs for effects in slowing the progression of AD, which will guide future clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents.",In Silico Screening of Medications for Slowing Alzheimer's Disease Progression.,10127546,R01AG057684,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Combination Medication', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Screening', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rapid screening', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical encounter', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cooperative study', 'cost', 'data mining', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'screening', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,645978
"MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION FOR UNBIAS BIOMARKER DISCOVERY FOR AD AND OTHER COMPLEX TRAITS Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia but has no effective prevention or treatment. The brain proteome, ascertained in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have proven to be a rich source of information, reflecting Aβ plaques deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal injury and inflammation, and have helped the enrollment of participants in clinical trials. Still, additional non-invasive and cost-effective biomarkers are critical for the early detection, disease intervention and monitoring. Novel biomarkers may also help identify and characterize the additional aspects of AD, such as rate of progression and age at onset. Although genetic studies have focused on the identification of variants associated with risk through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome and exome sequencing projects, the genetic factors modulating these additional aspects of AD are less investigated. The current proposal focuses on these understudied aspects of disease etiology, namely the role of common and rare genetic variation on quantitative diagnostic and prognostic endophenotypes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We will develop a unique resource – the proteome ascertained in a plasma, CSF and brain for a large number of samples – that will allow us to leverage unbiased approaches to reveal novel biomarkers and endophenotypes associated with AD and complex traits. We will utilize Mendelian Randomization to identify causal proteins involved in AD and extend our studies to other complex traits. We will use GWAS, exome-chip, whole-exome and whole-genome sequences to identify single variants, genes and pathways associated with plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain protein levels of AD biomarkers. NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with devastating personal, familial, societal and economical burdens, and there is currently no effective means of prevention or treatment. If successful, our research will reveal novel intermediate traits and genetic variants involved in AD and other complex traits, potentially leading to prospective therapeutic targets, and will also provide guidelines for accurate and practical assessments of AD status, which will be invaluable for evaluations of effectiveness of experimental treatments in clinical trials.",MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION FOR UNBIAS BIOMARKER DISCOVERY FOR AD AND OTHER COMPLEX TRAITS,10221566,R01AG057777,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Prevention', 'Prognosis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'TREM2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical risk', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'participant enrollment', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'rare variant', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'therapeutic target', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,757923
"Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Among APOE E4 Carriers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The e4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene has been identified as one of the strongest genetic determinants of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In general, the e4 allele is associated with reductions in neural protection and repair, increasing a carrier’s vulnerability to damage accumulated over his/her lifetime. Nevertheless, while the penetrance of ApoE e4 is relatively high, a significant proportion of e4 carriers will never develop AD. The overall goal of this project is to model interactions across multiple omics networks to identify the biological pathways involved in sporadic AD susceptibility versus resilience among high-risk individuals. The multifactorial nature of AD suggests that it may manifest as a result of complex interactions across the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Identifying the central networks involved in AD pathogenesis will require integrative Systems Biology approaches. The proposed research offers a new and innovative way to integrate networks—a dominant feature in biology—across multiple tissues and omics platforms, in order to identify innate and dynamic precursors of resilience to AD, among a high-risk population (e4+). Towards this goal, we will: (1) employ newly developed GWAS-based network analysis, to identify SNP networks that alter the association between ApoE e4 and cognitive decline/dementia; (2) generate DNA methylation and RNA-seq data from brain samples that we will analyze using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (3) generate proteomic data from brain and CSF samples that we will analyze using WGCNA to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (4) use advanced integromic network analysis to identify multi-omics and multi-tissue pathways and biological systems involved in AD resilience. The integration of multiple 'omics' data using systems biology will be crucial for unraveling the connections and interactions between various functional levels involved in complex diseases, such as AD. Overall, our proposed research will improve understanding of the complex biology underlying AD susceptibility. These studies have the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets that could inform the development of future pharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing or slowing AD pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals with the ApoE e4 genotype have a substantially increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The goal of this project is identify underlying biological interactions and networks that explain why some e4 carriers do not develop Alzheimer's disease, despite being high-risk. This research has the potential to uncover novel targets that can lead to the development of effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Among APOE E4 Carriers,10188369,R01AG057912,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Memory', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention therapy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genetic signature', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'religious order study', 'repaired', 'resilience', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,761628
"MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a leading cause of disability and death in the US and major global public health problem due to rise in aging population resulting in untold suffering, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies is certain. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Our application is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing to leverage an innovative molecular imaging platform invented at Stanford, multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI). We will determine the high dimensional cellular and subcellular protein-level expression, interaction, and localization for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomic and proteomic studies in resilience and pathologic states using human brain sections from an ongoing proteomic investigation of AD. We hypothesize that in-depth, stage-specific phenotypic signatures extracted from these unique groups will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. We will test our hypothesis through three Specific Aims: (1) Establish a subcellular, phenotypic framework of vulnerable and resistant brain areas. Next-generation MIBI equipment will be used to rigorously image 30+ proteins simultaneously; targets marking subtypes of neurons, synapses, non-neuronal cells, neuro-inflammatory, and vascular components will be concurrently measured. (2) Reveal cognitive resilience multiplexed phenotypes. Using approaches we have successfully applied in other single cell studies, we will analyze multiplexed imaging data with statistical deep learning methods already established in our lab to identify topological, cellular, and molecular phenotypic differences among resilient, co- morbid, and AD dementia. (3) Implement a shared data repository. The power of multiplexed imaging in biology is its ability to reveal co-localization or mutual exclusivity to infer regulatory roles and gain mechanistic insight. To disseminate hundreds of these images from our proposed highly multiplexed study, we will create a web-based portal, using already established infrastructure, where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi-color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features will be shared freely. PROJECT NARRATIVE AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the aging American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. Such signatures will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. Such insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets, as well as create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD.",MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease,10212937,R01AG057915,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Electrons', 'Equipment', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lobule', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'abeta accumulation', 'aging population', 'collaborative approach', 'comorbidity', 'computational pipelines', 'data repository', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'disease-causing mutation', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nanometer resolution', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'presenilin', 'presenilin-1', 'presenilin-2', 'resilience', 'response to injury', 'risk variant', 'symposium', 'tissue resource', 'vascular factor', 'web portal']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,865036
"Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimers Disease Abstract The exploration of genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes derived from brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by powerful computational tools has the potential of developing new knowledge, including the identification of pathways and targets that may be involved in the initiation and/or progression of the disease. The challenge is to find drugs that impact those pathways, and then validate the importance of those pathways – distinguishing primary disease drivers from secondary events. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to probe potential pathways in proof of concept, and ultimately therapeutic, clinical trials. Here, we propose to discover and validate hypotheses for drug repurposing in AD through three integrated, complementary informatics approaches. Specifically, we will apply classical and network aware (prior-loaded) machine learning approaches to identify pathways and targets altered in AD brains at different stages of disease progression using data from Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD available through Synapse (Aim 1); we will use systems pharmacology approaches to discover the target selectivity of lead compounds in human neuronal and glial cell types using unbiased RNA-seq, proteomic and imaging studies followed by pathway analysis (Aim 2). Each of these two Aims has two approaches: data-driven, hypothesis-generating analyses to discern disease-relevant drug signals; and hypothesis-testing in which positive findings from one approach are evaluated using the other approaches to assess rigor and reproducibility. Moreover, RNA-seq and proteomic data collected in cultured human CNS cell types following exposure to potential disease drivers and/or FDA-approved drugs in Aim 2 will be fed back into Aim 1 as CNS-cell type-derived priors to refine the predictive models. In Aim 3, we will develop new informatics strategies to conduct in-silico drug trials in EHR data with “prospective” outcomes to validate hypotheses based on the omics data sets and extant literature, using two big data sets: the UK 20 year CPRD longitudinal records of 20M National Health Service patients, and the RPDR Database (based at Partners Healthcare) with 6 M individuals followed for over 20 years. This integrated informatics program compensates for the limitations of each individual informatics approach to promote discovery and critical evaluation of “lead compounds” for known and novel AD pathways. To execute this strategy, we have assembled a multi-site, multi-disciplinary team with expertise ranging from clinical care to computer science and systems pharmacology. Some of the team members are AD experts and others bring an outsider's perspective. Finally, as a deliverable, we will create open-source data packages to release all the supporting evidence, software, and data with provenance in accordance with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) standards through Synapse and the AlzDataLens platform developed at MGH (Aim 4). These data packages will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies including collaborations with industry or members of the community at large involved in new clinical trials. Project Narrative Repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to accelerating proof-of-concept and ultimately therapeutic clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose a bioinformatics campaign, parallel to a traditional drug campaign, using available expression data from AD brains in the public domain as our “laboratory” and electronic heath records(EHR) as our “clinical trial infrastructure”. Resulting data packages from these analyses will be shared on Open Science platforms and will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies, ultimately leading to new clinical trials.",Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimers Disease,10212939,R01AG058063,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lewy Bodies', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Metformin', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular Target', 'National Health Services', 'Network-based', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cell type', 'cheminformatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'disease registry', 'drug candidate', 'drug repurposing', 'drug testing', 'gene discovery', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in silico', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'large datasets', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'open data', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein TDP-43', 'protein expression', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tau phosphorylation', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational study']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,748092
"Democratising Machine Learning for researchers working in Alzheimer's space RESEARCH SUMMARY One of the key challenges in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the early detection of individuals who are at risk of developing the condition, and subsequently making predictions about how rapidly their condition will progress. To facilitate this, the parent grant of this proposal (R01-AG058676-01A1) brings together ﬁve leading well char- acterized Alzheimer’s cohorts to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s dementia: the Adult Children Study (ACS), the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL), the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC). The resulting cohort is critical for understanding the factors which precipitate or delay dementia diagnosis. The large size of this dataset motivates the application of machine learn- ing(ML) and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) methodologies to address the critical questions of classifying individuals as at risk of AD and for making predictions about the future progression in terms of the disease, symptoms and function.  However, there are stark contrasts between the AD space and those domains where ML/AI techniques have been used to great success, such as computer vision, text mining and audio analytics. In particular, the smaller sample size, even for the largest datasets collected to date, means that highly expressive models are just as likely to detect technical artefacts in the data as real biological signal, especially when looking at high-dimensional in- formation where AI/ML is most appropriate. Moreover, standard ML/AI approaches do not typically work with missing values, a common feature of clinical AD cohorts, where certain types of measurements are difﬁcult to collect. Finally, the areas where AI/ML have fulﬁlled their promise are those where the barrier to entry for both ML and domain specialists has been reduced. This democratisation has been achieved largely by providing bench- mark datasets that have been processed to remove technical artefacts, have comprehensive documentation and adhere to under Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles.  In this grant, we seek to conduct high-resolution, multi-modal harmonisation and cross-dataset imputation of the ﬁve leading AD cohorts aiming to improve their suitability for AI/ML approaches, proving these in a form that is FAIR, well-documented and easy to use with AI/ML frameworks. While the parent grant performs some harmoni- sation of summary statistics (e.g. average amyloid levels from PET imaging, cognitive test summary statistics) and imputation using classical approaches, this extension seeks to improve the level of granularity (e.g entire images, individual or small groups of questions in cognitive tests) at which harmonisation is performed, and incorporate biological prior knowledge into data imputation. This will be achieved by leveraging recent advancements in al- gorithmic bias-removal and matrix completion, and will incorporate our understanding of disease processes and the nature of the modalities being analysed. The latter will put additional constraints on the inferential, allowing it to produce more accurate and sensible estimations of measurements. We will provide FAIR-curated version of these datasets, along with software to enable researchers to adjust the level of harmonisation and imputation as needed, based on the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying algorithms developed and implemented in this proposal.  The integration of the ﬁve largest longitudinal AD cohorts, as per the parent grant of this proposal, provides an invaluable opportunity to explore the power of AI/ML to improve our ability to detect AD early on and make accurate forecasts about individual’s change over time. This proposal seeks to bring modern AI/ML methods ﬁrmly into the AD community by producing curated de-biased datasets that can be seamlessly integrated into most existing ML pipelines. By improving the quality of the underlying data at a higher resolution than has been done before, predictive and prognostics models derived from this work are likely to be substantially more powerful than past approaches. RESEARCH NARRATIVE Recent developments in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated their incredible potential to improve predic- tive models – however, their applicability for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been limited by small datasets with inconsistent or missing measurements and limited documentation, raising the barriers of entry to AI researchers wishing to study AD or AD researchers wishing to apply AI. This study will focus on expanding the curating the ﬁve leading Alzheimer’s cohorts in order to improve their applicability for AI: the Adult Children Study (ACS), the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flag- ship Study of Ageing (AIBL), the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC). The study will focus on providing well-curated and documented versions of these datasets with the ultimate aim of driving innovation in the application of AI to Alzheimer’s disease and improving our ability to identify factors which precipitate or delay dementia diagnosis.",Democratising Machine Learning for researchers working in Alzheimer's space,10412149,R01AG058676,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult Children', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'FAIR principles', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Salvelinus', 'Sample Size', 'Ships', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Tenuate', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data to knowledge', 'file format', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning community', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'parent grant', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic model', 'protective factors', 'statistics', 'success', 'text searching']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE,R01,2021,211898
"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease, their families, the healthcare system, and the economy.

"Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a growing epidemic, and potential treatments are unlikely to be effective unless deployed during the earliest stages of AD, prior to cognitive symptoms. Currently there are no inexpensive, non-invasive biomarkers for effective AD screening necessary for early recognition and treatment on a broad scale. Sleep is abnormal in preclinical AD, even prior to cognitive symptoms, and disrupted sleep may in turn accelerate AD pathological mechanisms. Electroencephalography (EEG) directly measures brain function, and the stereotyped nature of sleep EEG offers a particularly rich opportunity to identify biomarkers of brain dysfunction due to AD. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that sleep-wake brain mechanisms are abnormal very early in AD, and can be detected via subtle but distinct sleep and EEG changes. The objective is to develop sleep and EEG biomarkers of AD, to enable non-invasive and inexpensive screening on a large scale, through the following specific aims.  Aim 1) Identify sleep-wake patterns across the 24-hour day characteristic of AD pathology. Ambulatory sleep-EEG data will be recorded over the 24-hour period in the home setting from a large, diverse, community-based cohort, with the hypothesis that increased sleep-wake transitions over the 24-hour day are characteristic of preclinical-to-mild AD. Aim 2) Assess slow wave integrity measures as biomarkers of AD pathology. EEG abnormalities of slow wave sleep are particularly associated with elevated amyloid-β levels and plaques. Novel analytic techniques will extract bihemispheric slow wave coherence, slow wave velocity, and slow wave intradaily ratio from EEG data collected during sleep and wake. The hypothesis is that amyloid plaques present in early AD will reduce slow wave integrity by all three measures. Aim 3) Determine the EEG signature of AD using machine learning. Machine learning techniques will be applied to EEG from a full attended overnight polysomnogram, to identify a “signature” of AD pathology. The goal is to identify a “signature” that can be detected with spatially limited EEG data that could be collected at home.  The expected outcome of these aims is to identify sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD that can be detected noninvasively and inexpensively at home. The impact of our work will be the ability to screen large populations easily for AD pathology, so that affected individuals can be identified and treated. Moreover, sleep-EEG biomarkers could be used to track disease progression and treatment response in clinical trials for AD. Lastly, since sleep disturbance has a direct effect on AD pathology, by identifying sleep-EEG changes very early in the pathological process, we may be able to intervene, improve sleep, and potentially change the trajectory of AD.  ! Project Narrative Combating the looming crisis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will require identifying and treating individuals with AD even before cognitive symptoms appear. The proposed project will develop sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD in a large, diverse, community-based cohort, which can be used for inexpensive, non-invasive screening for AD on a broad scale. This project will enable large-scale screening and treatment of early AD, use of sleep-EEG theranostic biomarkers for clinical and drug-development purposes, and intervention for sleep disturbances to potentially change the trajectory of AD.",Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease,10167595,R01AG059507,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Drug Development', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'Home', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Napping', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Race', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'early detection biomarkers', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'sleep onset', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep quality', 'tau Proteins', 'theranostics', 'treatment response']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,384934
"Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite well-documented disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and mortality, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial/ethnic minorities) are disproportionately under-represented in clinical AD research. Current recruitment methods for AD research predominantly identify patients from outpatient clinics and community settings, or with pre-existing diagnoses. Reliance on these recruitment approaches may create barriers to participation for disadvantaged individuals as they are more likely to lack information about AD services, be undiagnosed and have limited access to outpatient care. Yet, greater enrollment of disadvantaged individuals into AD studies is critically needed to achieve national goals for AD research. Targeted AD screening and tailored recruitment within acute care settings has strong potential to address these gaps, as disadvantaged individuals often rely on these settings to meet their health needs. This K76 proposal is designed to provide Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi, PhD, a geriatric trained nurse and expert in AD symptom management with the training required for success as an independent clinician-scientist focused on improving AD identification to promote greater participation in research and access to effective care and therapies, specifically targeting high-risk disadvantaged populations. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to design screening and recruitment approaches for identifying and engaging disadvantaged AD patients/caregivers and their biological children in research from acute care settings. The proposal consists of validation of an electronic health record (EHR) Phenotype Model for AD using EHR clinical data identified in preliminary studies (Aim 1), and specification of this Model for performance among disadvantaged individuals (Aim 1a). To address recruitment from acute care environments, mixed methods strategies will inform the design of tailored recruitment approaches appropriate to acute care (Aim 2) which will be piloted with 30 AD patients/caregivers to determine their feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on willingness to enroll in a Trial Registry (Aim 2a). As a junior faculty member at an institution with extensive support for early stage investigators and significant infrastructure in AD disparities and EHR Phenotyping, Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi is in an ideal environment to complete the proposed research and pursue advanced training relevant to her career goals. Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi’s career development plan integrates didactic and practical training, individual mentoring and mentored research activities in the areas of 1) clinical trial design, 2) advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, 3) acute care research, 4) AD health disparities, 5) recruitment and retention of vulnerable populations and 6) leadership. This proposed award addresses fundamental gaps and barriers to improve inclusion of disadvantaged individuals in AD research while affording training and mentored research critical for Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi to lead an independent research program in clinical AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Under-representation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial and ethnic minorities) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is a major barrier to achieving national AD research goals and exacerbates widespread health disparities in AD. The proposed research addresses fundamental barriers to research participation among disadvantaged individuals with AD through the development of novel 1) screening and 2) recruitment approaches within acute care settings, where many disadvantaged individuals routinely seek health care.

"Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease progression ABSTRACT. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting tens of millions of people. A top research priority in AD is to find a biomarker sensitive to early disease and disease progression because that will likely provide the best opportunities for searching and evaluating effective treatments for this currently incurable brain disease. Human brain relies on cerebral blood flow (CBF) for its energy supply and waste removal. Previous research has indicated that CBF reductions cause neuron inactivity and neurotoxic waste accumulation and subsequently neuron death, which may eventually lead to AD dementia. Measuring CBF and following its longitudinal course may then provide a highly potential biomarker for early AD and its progression. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI is a technique for quantifying CBF without using exogenous tracers. Because it is relatively cheaper and can be repeated many times, it is well suited for longitudinal AD research. Sensitivity of ASL MRI to AD and prodromal AD has been shown in many cross-sectional studies (comparing AD to controls) by other groups and us. But several important questions still remain unanswered including the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD and AD progression, the longitudinal CBF change patterns, and sex difference of CBF in AD. Addressing those questions needs large size longitudinal data and expertise for analyzing ASL MRI data due to the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The purpose of this project is to address those open questions by leveraging our extensive expertise on ASL MRI and the accumulating longitudinal ASL data from ADNI (a large ongoing multi-site AD neuroimaging study). The novel information or outcome from this project will include the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD, CBF change rate when disease progresses or reverts, gender effects in AD and its progression, and a next-generation ASL MRI processing algorithm based on deep-machine learning (DL), and a DL-based AD prediction model. We will first confirm our previous ADNI ASL CBF findings using larger sample and updated methods (not available before). We will then check sensitivity of ASL CBF for tracking and predicting disease progression or cognitive declines. Gender effects on CBF in AD will be explicitly examined, which may reveal a clue for the higher prevalence of AD in females. We will revisit those studies using the DL-based ASL denoising algorithm. Pursuing those aims will help establishing ASL CBF as an AD biomarker and provide a versatile AD prediction model using ASL CBF as well as other valuable biomarkers provided in ADNI. Developing and sharing the DL ASL MRI denoising method will benefit not only AD research but also the various scientific projects based on ASL MRI. The feasibility of this innovative but clinically important project is ensured by our decades of experience and the substantial pilot investigations in each aspect of the study, including ASL MRI, AD ASL study, and machine learning. Identifying biomarkers sensitive to early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its progression is central to AD studies. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) will be measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI and assessed for early AD detection and progression monitoring. We will also develop a next-generation ASL denoising technique to further improve ASL CBF SNR and reliability. Given our aging population and the increasing prevalence of AD, performing this project is likely to have significant public health impact. Developing the proposed technique will benefit not only AD study but the general neuroimaging research.",Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease progression,10105251,R01AG060054,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Energy Supply', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Spin Labels', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Update', 'Woman', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain metabolism', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'early detection biomarkers', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'glucose metabolism', 'hypoperfusion', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal course', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuron loss', 'neurotoxic', 'neurovascular', 'next generation', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prodromal Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'rate of change', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'technique development', 'wasting']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,446131
"GaitIQ: Establishing a Digital Biomarker of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Early detection of pre-clinical Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) during the long latent period prior to manifest dementia offers significant opportunities to advance the development of disease modifying interventions and effectively slow the disease’s progression. To achieve this objective, there is a critical need for new technologies that accelerate the development of biomarkers with high sensitivity for underlying AD pathology. A highly promising biomarker for preclinical AD is gait, as subtle gait changes have been correlated with elevated amyloid burden and cortical atrophy. While even simple measures of gait speed predict incident dementia in older adults, current research indicates that preclinical AD pathology is more precisely captured by a combination of 3D kinematic and spatio-temporal measures. A cost-effective mobile application that can be used in clinical trials and by healthcare personnel to capture these parameters efficiently, combined with a validated system to translate the measures to quantifiable AD risk in minutes, would result in a paradigm shift in availability of AD screening for at-risk individuals. GaitIQ™ is an innovative digital health startup company developing an online software-based product that employs computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) to compute clinically accurate spatio-temporal and 3D kinematic data, from a simple video of a person walking. GaitIQTM collaborates with The Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio and Southwest Research Institute for this SBIR project. The expected outcome is that advanced kinematic/spatio-temporal measures of gait captured by the GaitIQTM system will reveal a sensitive and specific gait signature with high diagnostic accuracy for pre-clinical AD in a sample of Hispanic older adults. The project will develop and validate the capacity of GaitIQ™ to detect a digital gait biomarker signature that distinguishes between individuals with preclinical AD and controls. The final digital platform will be an easy-to-use, powerful tool to identify and monitor patients with pre-clinical AD using just an iPad/tablet to video their gait and submit it for analysis in the cloud by GaitIQTM sophisticated, proprietary analysis software.

"A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs To stem the rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in our aging population, new methods to repurpose and combine drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) are acutely required. This is a challenge, however, because the complex polygenic basis of AD remains opaque, and rational methods to repurpose drugs are in early years, even for well-defined gene targets. To address these problems, we propose new algorithms to integrate data on a very large scale so as to combine evolutionary information and high-throughput experimental observations with the knowledge conveyed by text in the literature. First, to detect disease-relevant genome variations in AD patients, Aim 1 will combine a novel mathematical calculus of mutational landscapes with machine learning, in so doing suggesting primary candidate genes for drug targeting based on signs of mutational selection in cases or controls. Next, to repurpose and combine drugs targeting these genes, Aim 2 will map a large fraction of all that is known about genes, phenotypes, and drugs into a single high-dimensional network that represents their interactions as described in various databases (structured data) and in the literature (unstructured data). The topology of this network will determine the optimal choice of single drug or combination therapy in an approach that can be personalized. Finally, to validate efficacy experimentally, Aim 3 will test both our candidate genes and drugs with state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo screens. Feasibility rests with prior studies on evolution, networks, systems, and text-mining that demonstrate accurate predictions of deleterious mutations and their clinical sequelae and the discovery of drivers of diseases. Broadly, this work will yield proof of principle for a novel quantitative model that integrates fundamental concepts from mathematics and molecular evolution, and for a low resolution but large-scale map of biomedical knowledge in which network notions of distance computed by machine learning identify relevant functional hypothesis that would otherwise be easily overlooked. The result will be a new experimental ability to unravel the genotype-phenotype relationship in Alzheimer's Disease so as to guide drug therapy. Alzheimer's is a devastating disease projected to rise dramatically in our aging population. To develop drugs against it, we propose to train machine learning on the DNA of patients with Alzheimer's to detect genes with abnormal mathematical features in their mutations. Then, we will place these genes in a “map”, which represents a large fraction of biomedical knowledge in a high-dimensional network. The drugs that fall near our genes of interest in this map are our candidates, and experiments will test in cell and mouse models whether they affect the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's.",A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs,10163764,R01AG061105,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor', 'Animal Model', 'Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Behavior', 'Calculi', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Production', 'PubMed', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'database structure', 'disorder risk', 'drug repurposing', 'drug testing', 'efficacy validation', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'interest', 'molecular modeling', 'mouse model', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision drugs', 'protective factors', 'screening', 'stem', 'structured data', 'success', 'synergism', 'tau Proteins', 'text searching', 'unstructured data', 'virtual']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,792498
"Interpretable Machine Learning to Identify Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutic Targets Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an urgent national and international research priority. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark of AD. Their building blocks are Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, respectively. At present, we lack an understanding of the set of genes that affect formation of plaques and tangles along with protective and pathological responses to these toxic peptides. Biologists are now gathering gene expression data and Aβ and tau measures from human brain tissues. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (here, gene expression levels) that best predict an outcome (Aβ or tau level). The identified features, biomarkers, can help determine the molecular basis for plaques and tangles. Unfortunately, false positive biomarkers are very common, as evidenced by low success rates of replication in independent data and low success reaching clinical practice (less than 1%). We seek to radically shift the current paradigm in biomarker discovery by resolving three fundamental problems with the current approach using novel, theoretically well-founded machine learning (ML) methods to learn interpretable models from data. Aim 1. Learn an interpretable feature representation from publicly available, high-throughput brain data. High-dimensionality, hidden variables, and complex feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., observed statistical associations) and true biological interactions. To increase the chance to identify true positive biomarkers, we need new feature selection criteria to learn a model that better explains rather than simply predicts the outcome. To do so, our proposed ML algorithms will identify the genes that are likely to give a meaningful explanation of the outcome (Aβ or tau level) by inferring both the functions of genes in the cellular processes contributing to AD and the gene interaction network from many existing brain datasets. Aim 2. Make interpretable predictions using a unified framework to explain model predictions. Due to disease heterogeneity, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) often more accurately describe relationships between genes and an outcome than simpler, linear models, but lack interpretability. We will develop a novel ML framework that interprets complex model predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a specific prediction, which will identify features of high importance for each individual as personalized markers and classify subjects based on these importance estimates. Aim 3. Validate the identified candidate biomarkers using powerful worm models of AD. Analyzing observational data without doing interventional experiments cannot prove causal relationships. In collaboration with co-I Matt Kaeberlein, we will utilize powerful nematode models of AD to test our hypotheses on the role of certain genes as disease modifiers, and develop a new way to refine the models based on this knowledge. Successful completion of this project will result in previously unknown molecular basis for Aβ and tau levels, potential therapeutic targets, and general ML techniques widely applicable to many other data science problems. Project Narrative In the United States alone, someone receives an Alzheimer’s diagnosis every 66 seconds, and the disease has become the 6th leading cause of death in this country; Alzheimer’s disease (AD) currently has no cure, no prevention, and no treatment to reverse or halt its deadly progression. The recent, rapid growth of gene expression data from human brain tissues hold great promise for identifying therapeutic targets, but extremely low success rates to identify true positive biomarkers indicate fundamental problems with the current computational approach being used. We seek to revolutionize the way we identify drug targets by developing novel machine learning techniques that extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data, combined with biological validation in an animal model of AD.",Interpretable Machine Learning to Identify Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutic Targets,10132962,R01AG061132,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Model', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational workshop', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'Network-based', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Oral', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'RNA Interference', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Selection Criteria', 'Senile Plaques', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain tissue', 'candidate marker', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'direct application', 'disease heterogeneity', 'drug response prediction', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'proteostasis', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,582016
"Identification and Characterization of Common Pathways across Alzheimer Disease Genotypes using a Multiomic Approach Alzheimer disease (AD) is a multigenic and multifactorial condition with a common pathological hallmark, deposition of Aβ and tau proteins aggregates in the brain. A few genes have been directly involved in the protein deposition metabolism. Another 24 loci have been identified as risk factors for AD which have shed light into other impaired mechanisms. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how all these pathways are interrelated towards a same ending phenotype. Omic technologies have been instrumental in complementing our understanding of the pathways involved between disruption of particular loci and final pathology. However, each one of these studies only explains a modest portion of the pathology of AD, whilst complex diseases involve a highly dynamic and interactive system of molecular layers. The central hypothesis is that different molecular layers are interconnected in AD so that the dysregulation of any of these causes the ultimate AD phenotype (Aβ and tau proteins aggregates). Multi-omic analysis can provide an insight into how different molecular dimensions interact with each other, an insight that single omic data cannot provide. Also, there is limited availability of multi-omic data collected on the same group of individuals and tissue. The objective of this project is to identify dysregulated pathways consistent across molecilar layers. In the K99 phase of the award, I plan to generate single-omic profiles (transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic) from brain tissue from highly characterized individuals. I will also leverage existing GWAs data for these individuals to conduct pair-wise integrative analysis to identify common variants that act as genetic regulators (QTL) for the identified dysregulated molecular markers. To conduct these analyses, I will gain training in network and pathway analysis, but also in big data and machine learning methods. During this period, I will also receive training in handling of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSc) and in functional analysis. Preliminary analysis using transcriptomic data have identified AGFG2 gene to be overexpressed across AD etiologies compared to controls. AGFG2 is an astrocyte expressed gene that seems to be involved in Aβ metabolism. During the K99 phase I will examine the role of AGFG2 in iPSC-derived astrocytes from AD patients' carriers of known pathogenic mutations (ADAD). Having acquired this knowledge, during the R00 phase I will explore whether dysregulation of AGFG2 has the same effect in ADAD as in iPSC-derived astrocytes from early onset and late onset AD patients. Finally, I will elevate the pair-wise integration of omic data to a meta-dimensional level. This will allow me to identify molecular signals (transcripts, proteins, metabolites) that are consistent across molecular layers. If successful, this project has the potential to reveal novel insights of AD biology, which will be of interest to the scientific community. In addition, with this award I will develop a translational profile which will be invaluable for establishing me as an independent investigator in the growing field of systems biology. Project Narrative This study will use multi-omic data from brain tissue from Alzheimer disease (AD) cases and healthy individuals to identify biological abnormalities that are consistent across molecular layers which will be validated on iPSc.

"Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting 1 in 8 individuals over 65 years old in the US. Within AD, approximately 40-60% individuals are affected by psychotic symptoms (AD+P), which are associated with more rapid cognitive decline, greater disability, mortality and caregiver burden, resulting in a disproportionately large disease burden. Recent studies indicate a genetic basis for AD+P risk, but the molecular basis of AD+P remains largely uncharacterized, hindering the search for appropriate treatments and novel therapeutics. In this proposal, we seek to systematically dissect the mechanistic basis of AD+P by systematic generation, integration, and experimental dissection of transcriptional and epigenomic phenotypes across two brain regions and four cell types. (1) We profile single-cell RNA-seq and cell-type specific H3K27ac ChIP-seq across 192 post-mortem brain samples, each in two regions across AD patients with psychosis, AD patients with no psychosis, schizophrenia patients with no AD, and control individuals. (2) We integrate the resulting datasets with genetic information and GWAS data to predict driver genes, regions, variants, and pathways underlying AD+P using state-of-the-art machine learning methods for causality, mediation analysis, and genetic Bayesian fine- mapping. (3) We use our computational predictions to guide a systematic dissection of the molecular underpinnings of AD+P using a modular and programmable CRISPR-Cas9 methodology in iPSC lines to modulate regulatory elements, genes and alleles, and measure the resulting molecular and cellular phenotypes in cell-autonomous and non-autonomous phenotypes. If successful, this ambitious proposal has the potential to provide the first mechanistic insights on the development of psychotic symptoms in AD+P and/or P-AD, reveal functional risk variants and target genes for therapeutic intervention that will likely influence clinical management in order to alleviate the personal and societal burden associated with these disorders.

"The Neuropathologic Landscape of Alzheimer's Disease in Hispanic Decedents Abstract: Hispanics are the fastest growing population in the US and epidemiological data suggests they are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and have a higher occurrence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) when compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). AD is defined neuropathologically by the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid plaques. In addition to these hallmarks, many AD patients have mixed neuropathologies, including Lewy bodies (LBs) and pathological indices of CVD. Studies, involving mainly NHWs, have shown associations of these neuropathologies with clinical, genetic, and demographic variables providing insights into disease mechanisms and prevention strategies. However, there is a relative dearth of neuropathology studies on Hispanics. It is imperative to have neuropathology studies with individuals having diverse characteristics as this maximizes variability allowing for better identification of disease risk factors for more precision in development of preventative measures. This study will examine the neuropathologic landscape (the presence, location, and density of NFTs, plaques, CVD and LBs) of Hispanics compared to NHWs and determine if this landscape is altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables. To achieve efficiencies in time and further measurement precision we will enhance and adapt innovative machine learning algorithms to narrow in on pathology location and provide more quantitative analyses. Based on previous findings our central hypothesis is that Hispanics will have different neuropathologic landscapes when compared to NHWs and these differences are influenced by underlying risk factors, especially cardiovascular risk factors. Our specific aims are to: 1) profile the presence, location, and semi-quantitative densities of NFTs, plaques, LBs, and pathological indices of CVD in the setting of AD in Hispanics compared to NHWs, 2) profile and determine if pathologic measures from Aim 1 are altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables (APOE status, Hispanic origin, age at death, clinical history of cerebrovascular events (i.e. stroke), hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, sex, and/or education) and 3) strengthen and adapt a deep learning pipeline for quantifying AD pathologies. We will capitalize on existing well-characterized resources within three Alzheimer’s disease centers at University of California- Davis, the University of California- San Diego, and Columbia that contain a diverse autopsy confirmed AD Hispanic and NHW cohort. Also, we will use machine learning resources at the University of California San Francisco. This proposal will be the first largescale initiative to delineate the neuropathology in over 100 Hispanics of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican origins compare to over 200 NHWs and determine the impact of comorbid risk factors. Profiling neuropathologic landscapes and understanding underlying factors has potential to shed light on mechanistic differences in disease development leading to better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies.

"The Neuropathologic Landscape of Alzheimer's Disease in Hispanic Decedents ABSTRACT Citizen science, public participation in the scientific process, leverages the unique properties of human cognition to distribute the analysis of massive data sets to the general public. Recently, the Human Computation Institute (HCI) used this approach to crowdsource the analysis of in-vivo two-photon excitation microscopy (2PEF) data, which has accelerated Cornell University’s Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research by a factor of five, elucidating molecular mechanisms that underlie capillary stalling in mouse models of AD. For this administrative supplement, we now propose to develop and validate a new online platform that crowdsources the histopathological analysis of whole slide images (WSI) of the human brain. This would support the rapid acquisition of high-volume datasets needed to train an automated classifier in support of our existing R01 studies investigating the neuropathological landscape of AD within Hispanic and non-Hispanic White decedents. Deriving research-grade classification labels from multi-source WSI entails data quality requirements that exceed today’s best automated methods. Thus, we intend to develop a crowd-powered analytic pipeline that reduces the histopathological analysis into a step-wise series of manageable online tasks that could be accomplished by non-expert members of the general public, as well as “wisdom of crowd” methods for aggregating many individual answers into a single expert-like answer. In service of these objectives, our specific aims are to develop the process, interfaces, and aggregation methods needed to support the crowd-powered analytic pipeline and evaluate its internal validity. We will employ a repeated cross-validation protocol to test the hypothesis that the crowd-based analysis will result in at least 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity for two major pathology categories (plaques and tangles) relative to gold standard data provided by expert annotators. If these validation studies are successful, an online platform incorporating this analytic pipeline will be used to execute the first ever de novo analysis of Alzheimer’s histopathology imagery by a crowd of volunteers (geared towards those of Hispanic heritage), be used to train a neural network model for automating the analysis, and will support the ongoing improvement of a reusable digital pathology workflow tool that is sensitive to an expanding repertoire of pathology targets. NARRATIVE This proposal will speed up Alzheimer’s research by automating pathology classifications through crowd-based generation of neural network training data. The attendant citizen-science platform will support ongoing improvement of an open digital pathology tool that is sensitive to an expanding repertoire of histopathology targets. The platform will engage Hispanic communities directly impacted by this research in its very execution, while providing a culturally responsive outreach and inclusion program for these communities to represent themselves in discussions with researchers.",The Neuropathologic Landscape of Alzheimer's Disease in Hispanic Decedents,10336290,R01AG062517,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hispanics', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Participation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'data quality', 'data standards', 'design', 'digital pathology', 'empowerment', 'epidemiologic data', 'high risk', 'human imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neural network', 'neuropathology', 'outreach', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'stem', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy', 'validation studies', 'volunteer', 'whole slide imaging']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,294103
"Plasma Cell-Free RNA as Non-invasive Biomarker for Neurodegeneration Project Summary / Abstract Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Pathological changes in the brain can be observed at least 15 years before clinical symptoms (preclinical stage). An early and accurate diagnosis tool could save $7.9 trillion in medical and care costs. Moreover, an effective therapeutic strategy could improve the clinical outcome if delivered early. There is a clear need to develop cost-effective and non-invasive biomarkers for AD that can be used to identify individuals before symptoms emerge and patients at early-symptomatic stages of disease. These novel biomarkers could be also leveraged to monitor disease progression and responses to therapies. Cell-free nucleic acids diagnostic tests have revolutionized prenatal screening, and cancer research, diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, specific transcripts ascertained from cell-free RNA have been evaluated as biomarkers for AD, but so far, no high throughput approach has been attempted. The goal of this proposal is to use high throughput sequencing of cell-free nucleic acids from plasma to construct a prediction model for neurodegenerative diseases. I hypothesize that there are detectable changes in plasma cell-free nucleic acids that are related to AD. During the K99 phase, I aim to predict accurately AD cases using cell-free nucleic acid and bioinformatics tools, including machine learning. Briefly, I will sequence cell-free RNA present in longitudinal samples of plasma from AD cases and controls, then build a predictive model. I will replicate this model in an independent dataset of preclinical samples. I will include samples from mutation carriers and non-European ancestry to validate the model. I will also determine if the model can predict other neurodegenerative diseases or if it is specific to AD by quantifying plasma transcripts from patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. My preliminary data show that this approach is feasible. I designed a preliminary predictive model with 10 AD cases and 10 controls that has an area under the ROC curve of 1; then I replicated it in independent samples (n=20) with an area under the ROC curve of 0.84. In four preclinical samples the ROC was 0.86 suggesting that my model can also identify pre-symptomatic individuals. It is possible to improve this model by using more powerful informatics approaches. Using deep neural networks, I obtained a ROC of 1 in the discovery dataset and 0.94 in the replication dataset. During the R00 phase, I plan to use the same approach on other neurodegenerative diseases to design specific predictive models. I will generate sequence data on the RNA present in longitudinal plasma samples of cases and controls from Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies to construct specific predictive models for each of them. Then I will replicate the models in preclinical samples of these diseases. Combining the information on all neurodegenerative diseases will also allow me to refine the predictive model and perform integrative analyses to describe mechanistic insights. My ultimate goal is to be able to use the predictive models as diagnostic tools, and if possible, as early diagnostic tests. The preliminary data is encouraging and opens the possibility of having plasma-based tests for neurodegeneration. Project Narrative This proposal will use transcriptomic data from plasma to model a predictive tool for Alzheimer Disease using bioinformatics and machine learning approaches. This is an innovative approach, a cost-effective and minimally invasive biomarker for Alzheimer Disease, which is critical for early detection (preclinical), diagnosis, disease intervention and monitoring. If successful, the results will lead to a breakthrough in the field.",Plasma Cell-Free RNA as Non-invasive Biomarker for Neurodegeneration,10090547,K99AG062723,"['African American', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnostic', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Dementia with Lewy Bodies', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Fetal Development', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Reagent', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Specificity', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'abeta deposition', 'accurate diagnosis', 'alpha synuclein', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'blood-based biomarker', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diagnostic screening', 'digital', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder control', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'minimally invasive', 'mutation carrier', 'nano-string', 'neuropathology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prenatal testing', 'presenilin-1', 'presenilin-2', 'prognostic tool', 'response', 'skills', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,125096
"An acoustofluidic device for diagnosing preclinical Alzheimer's disease Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a crippling, terminal neurodegenerative illness that affects an estimated 5.5 million people in the United States and approximately 10% of the population over the age of 65. Early symptoms of the disease include impairment in recent memory, difficulties with expressive language, and behavioral changes including depressed mood. Symptoms gradually worsen over time, ultimately leading to dementia and a loss of bodily functions. Currently there is no sensitive, objective diagnostic test for the early diagnosis of AD, making it difficult for physicians to properly screen for the disease and failing to diagnose patients that may be positive for AD. While advances have been made in medical imaging for AD, they are extremely costly and have limited diagnostic accuracy. In recent years, neuron-derived exosomes (30-150 nm extracellular vesicles) have emerged as a promising biomarker for diagnosing AD. Neuron-derived exosomes found in circulation can provide a simple, non-invasive means of monitoring the health of the central nervous system. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuron-derived exosomes may play a crucial role in the pathology of AD by helping to spread abnormal, potentially disease-causing, misfolded proteins throughout the brain. Preliminary studies have shown that by analyzing the number of neuron-derived exosomes and their molecular cargo, early-stage AD patients can be distinguished from healthy controls, as well as patients with other neurological diseases. While researchers have made progress in identifying neuron-derived exosomal proteins and RNAs, difficulties surrounding the isolation and analysis of exosomes have prevented their widespread use as a biomarker for AD. Currently, there are no commercially available products capable of simultaneously isolating and analyzing neuron-derived exosomes. The objective of this SBIR project is to overcome the limitations of existing AD diagnostic technologies and address the unmet needs in the market by developing and commercializing an automated, high-purity, high-yield, biocompatible exosome isolation and accurate AD biomarker detection using acoustofluidic (i.e., the fusion of acoustics and fluid mechanics) separation and electrochemical detection technologies. During our work on the Phase I project, we successfully demonstrated the utility and feasibility of the proposed exosome isolation and analysis device for AD diagnosis by meeting or exceeding the target values for each of the four key parameters identified in the Measures of Success. In Phase II, our commercialization activities will improve the performance of the acoustofluidic chips, develop self-contained, beta-testing-ready prototypes, and validate their performance with end users. With its advantages in automation, speed, precision, and accuracy, the proposed acoustofluidic technology has the potential to greatly simplify and revolutionize the diagnosis of AD. The result will be a highly sensitive liquid biopsy that will provide a comprehensive molecular signature for AD, thus significantly improving diagnostic accuracy past existing methods and providing deeper insight in the pathophysiology of the disease. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease is a devastating terminal disease with no cure, and rapidly increasing worldwide prevalence, posing a global crisis to the healthcare economy. There is a critical need to identify at earlier stages of the disease to better develop preventative and treatment strategies, however there has yet to be a standard test that is easy to admit with a high accuracy at early stages of the disease. The objective of this proposed project is to develop and commercialize an acoustic-based liquid biopsy that will serve as a platform for conducting simple blood tests with rapid processing times and high accuracy for a large suite of exosomal based biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease present in the patients’ blood – an industry first.",An acoustofluidic device for diagnosing preclinical Alzheimer's disease,10325078,R44AG063643,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnostic', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease test', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Dementia', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronics', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Lipoproteins', 'Liquid substance', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'RNA', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminal Disease', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'accurate diagnostics', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'candidate marker', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'detection sensitivity', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic technologies', 'early detection biomarkers', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'liquid biopsy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'microfluidic technology', 'microsystems', 'misfolded protein', 'nanobiotechnology', 'nanoscale', 'nervous system disorder', 'new technology', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,"ASCENT BIO-NANO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2021,1240614
"Alzheimer's Gut Microbiome Project ABSTRACT – Overall Behavioral, emotional and cognitive disorders have been historically studied as diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). However, emerging data suggests a gut-brain connection in a variety of diseases that affect the brain. Our own data and others’ suggests a gut-brain connection in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is the leading cause of dementia. There are currently no therapies to prevent or slow AD progression, causing a huge socioeconomic burden and highlighting our incomplete knowledge. Given an emerging role for gut microbiome and hypotheses implicating viral and bacterial contributions to AD pathogenesis, defining the bidirectional biochemical communication between the brain and the gut will improve understanding of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Indeed, it is crucial to study the brain not in isolation, but in the context of peripheral influences including diet, lifestyle, and microbiome. In this proposal we build on large initiatives and infrastructures co-established by our multi-disciplinary team including: The American Gut Project, The AD Metabolomics Consortium, Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs), National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD), The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) and centers of excellence in informatics and systems biology. We aim to define the role of gut microbiome in AD pathogenesis and biochemical axis of communication between gut and brain. Aim 1: Examine the association between the gut microbiome and AD phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the biochemical axis of communication between the gut microbiome and the brain and identify metabolites that contribute to AD endophenotypes. Aim 3: Examine mechanistic links between the activity of the gut microbiome and AD pathogenesis, and identify new approaches for AD prevention that target the gut-brain axis. These aims will be enabled three projects supported by an Omics and Technology Core, a Computational and Systems Biology Core, and an Administrative Core that provides data and biorepository infrastructure. Project 1 will define changes in gut microbiome and metabolome across the AD trajectory; Project 2 leverages three existing clinical trials of controlled diets to examine dietary effects on gut microbiome, metabolome, cognition and brain imaging; Project 3 examines mechanism by defining gut- brain communication and microbiome-based interventions in animal models of AD. In this U19 we will create an unprecedented, high-quality dataset and resources specifically for the AD research community, and make these available under open science, FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data principles. With our cross-disciplinary team of experts in clinical AD, gut microbiome research, imaging, metabolomics, informatics, deep learning and systems biology, this effort will yield novel biomarkers for AD progression and prognosis, and insight into mechanisms opening the door to development of transformative options for AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE – Overall Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurological disease in the US and evidence suggests that genetics, gut bacteria, diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposures contribute to human metabolism and its dysregulation in diseases including AD. Gut-brain biochemical axis are being identified and seem implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders like AD. Understanding how different diets can prevent or reverse AD, and targets that could be delivered microbioiologically or pharmacologically to persons who cannot or will not change their diet, is an important long-term goal in AD research, especially given the emerging understanding that responses to diet are highly individualized and dependent on the microbiome. The goal of the current project is to define the gut-brain-chemical axis of communication of the role of the gut microbiome in AD pathogenesis.",Alzheimer's Gut Microbiome Project,10251258,U19AG063744,"['3xTg-AD mouse', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amines', 'Animal Model', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bile Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Emotional disorder', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'FAIR principles', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Manipulative Therapies', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Microbe', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Translations', 'Viral', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Work', 'Xenobiotics', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'cytotoxic', 'deep learning', 'dietary', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'endophenotype', 'fecal metabolome', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'open data', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'symposium']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,U19,2021,5321511
"Predictive analytics for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is a major global healthcare burden. However, there is still no effective disease modifying therapy for AD and clinical trials with the aim of preventing or stabilizing cognitive impairment have largely failed. Decision making in both clinical practice and research is highly dependent on practical predictive tools, which can effectively predict cognitive or functional outcomes in individuals. Such models could be potentially used in clinical research to boost the power of trials by enrollment of participants who are most likely to show disease progression during the trial’s timeframe. Alternatively, these models could be used to identifying individuals who would benefit from primary or secondary prevention once there are effective treatments for AD. In this project, we aim to provide a framework for practical prediction of cognitive decline with aging and prodromal AD, by applying a novel ML framework to multiple dimensions of data (demographics, genetic risk scores, neuropsychological measures, structural MRI, and amyloid imaging). Our ultimate goal is to arrive at a new “Machine Learning predictive framework for aging and AD” (ML4AD), comprised of dimensions each of which each will add incremental value to the predictive models, hence increasing the performance of predictive models while keeping the costs and burden of research at a minimum. The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23), Dr. Ali Ezzati, is a Neurologist whose career goal is to develop predictive tools to help research and clinical decision making in cognitive aging and dementia. The proposed research will leverage the rich clinical and biomarker dataset available from several ongoing international studies, but will also provide a unique avenue of investigation for the candidate. The candidate's career development will benefit from close mentorship and scientific guidance of outstanding investigators in aging/AD neurobiology (Dr. Lipton), machine learning and computational neuroscience (Dr. Davatzikos), and biostatistics (Dr. Hall). The findings from this study will inform future secondary prevention trials, in which sensitive indicators of early AD will be necessary to identify high-risk subjects and track early clinical decline. This work will serve as the foundation to move forward in independent research focusing on development of predictive tools in AD and related neurodegenerative disorders. Key words: Alzheimer’s Disease, Dementia, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Cognitive neurology, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics, Longitudinal Cohort, Big Data Project Narrative This project aims to develop new models for prediction of cognitive outcomes including cognitive change and incident Alzheimer’s disease. Prediction models will be developed by applying advanced machine learning techniques to high-dimensional data including clinical, neuropsychological, genetic, and biomarker data.

"Genetic Predictors, Transcriptomic Biomarkers, & Neurobiological Signatures of Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary Over the last decade, scientists have accelerated their efforts to understand Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This has led to unprecedented knowledge of the genetic and biological bases of AD risk, and vast stores of valuable data for further mining. Understanding the genetic and biological risk states for AD is, in itself, extraordinarily valuable for guiding mechanistic studies, developing better diagnostics, and formulating therapeutics. But an understanding of risk states also has the benefit of allowing research on resilience to AD. Research on the genetic and biological bases of resilience necessarily lags behind the discovery of risk factors. Now, as the risk architecture of AD is coming into view, it is feasible to study resilience to AD in individuals who are cognitively normal despite being at elevated risk for the disease. The approach we have devised for identifying resilience factors is straightforward yet, to our knowledge, unprecedented. We identify unaffected individuals at the highest levels of multivariate risk, match them to affected individuals at equivalent levels of risk, and contrast these two subgroups to find residual variation associated with the absence of disease. In this project, we will capitalize on the wealth of existing high-throughput AD risk-factor results and data, and our involvement in many of the world’s largest AD consortia, to efficiently map resilience to AD at three levels (genetics, transcriptomics, and neuroimaging), and to integrate across these levels. In Aim 1, we will identify genetic variation associated with resilience to AD in the presence of elevated genetic risk conferred by APOE ε4 alleles, an elevated AD polygenic risk score, or an elevated AD polygenic hazard score. In Aim 2, we will mega-analyze all available transcriptomic data from studies of postmortem hippocampal tissue and of peripheral blood in AD to identify transcriptomic risk scores and machine-learning algorithms that maximally distinguish AD from cognitively normal control subjects, and scores and algorithms that then identify residual transcriptomic variation that offsets the transcriptomic risk in resilient controls. In Aim 3, we will identify an MRI-based structural brain signature that is associated with resilience to AD in the presence of an AD- associated cortical risk signature. Lastly, in our exploratory Aim 4, we will integrate genetic, transcriptomic, brain structural, and clinical data to identify biological relationships across Aims, and novel phenotypes of resilience. Collectively, these Aims will identify multivariate, genetic, transcriptomic, and brain-structural profiles of resilience to AD, as well as molecular, neurobiological, and clinical phenotypes stemming from AD- resilience genotypes. Project Narrative Not all people at high risk for Alzheimer's disease develop the disorder. This project aims to identify genes, molecules, and brain structures that protect some people from their otherwise-elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease. Finding the biological basis for resilience to Alzheimer's disease may shed light on better options for diagnosing, treating, and even preventing the illness, in ways that can't be found by only studying people who already have the disease.","Genetic Predictors, Transcriptomic Biomarkers, & Neurobiological Signatures of Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease",10212961,R01AG064955,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Store', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'brain tissue', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'phenome', 'polygenic risk score', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'stem', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,759051
"Combine Genomics and Symptoms Data Driven Models to Discover Synergistic Combinatory Therapies for Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary In 2018, an estimated 5.7 million people have Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or a related dementia in the U.S., with related healthcare costs of ~$277 billion1. However, there is no cure yet for AD. One major challenge is that the complicated pathogenesis of AD remains unclear, though >42 genes/loci have been associated with AD2,3. These genes are not actionable or druggable yet for AD management2. Over 240 drugs were tested in clinical trials but no new drugs have been approved for AD since 20031,4. The failure of these drugs is likely, in part, due to the limited efficacy of single agents to treat AD that is a genetically complex, multifactorial disease2, i.e., robust molecular signaling crosstalks among multi-pathways2,5,6,7,8,9, as well as complicated niche factors, e.g., oxidative stress10,11,12,13, and inflammation14,15,16, leading to neuron de-generation. Therefore, combination therapies eliminating these niche factors, and disrupting the dysfunctional signaling pathways and cross-talks, can be more effective than single agents for in AD patients. The goal of this study is to fill the gap of accelerating repositioning of combination therapies for AD using following novel genomics and symptoms data-driven models seamlessly integrating well designed iPSC Aβ AD models. The Washington University Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Knight-ADRC), has generated comprehensive omics data for a large group of AD samples. We propose to (in Aim 1) uncover core signaling pathways and crosstalks of ApoE4 genotype-specific AD subtypes via a novel signaling convergence network model, and consequently to discover synergistic Signaling Network Disruption drug combinations (SNDdc) via novel drug prediction models integrating heterogenous pharmacogenomics datasets. On the other hand, we propose to (in Aim 2) discover potential Neuron Protective drug combinations (NPdc) using electronic health records (EHR), available in BJC HealthCare system (includes 14 academic and community hospitals in Missouri and Illinois), of patients with brain injury diseases, especially Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), via a novel high-order poly-pharmacy efficacy and safety model. We hypothesize that acute brain damage in TBI will share the aforementioned key AD-related niche factors. Also because TBI patients often require multiple drugs daily (high-order poly-pharmacy use), we propose that TBI provides an appropriate model to study synergy and interactions of combination therapies that can ameliorate acute brain injury, and thus suggest potentially neuron protective combinations. Combinations in SNDdc and NPdc provide candidates for novel and effective AD treatment. To filter the false positives, we will (in Aim 3) utilize pooled CRISPR functional genomics and iPSC neurodegeneration model to identify key signaling genes, and validate combination therapies with ApoE4 genotype-specific iPSC Aβ models. Our new models represent a potential breakthrough in AD combination therapies discovery. Project Narrative About 44 million people worldwide are estimated to have Alzheimer disease (AD) or a related dementia. However, there are no effective or curative therapies yet for AD.

"3D Reconstruction and Analysis of Alzheimer's Patient Biopsy Samples to Map and Quantify Hallmarks of Pathogenesis and Vulnerability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This project will expand the acquisition, reconstruction, analysis, and dissemination of 3D electron microscopic (3D EM) reference data, disclosing key ultrastructural details preserved within a remarkable collection of legacy biopsy brain samples from patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). These samples were originally collected, characterized and archived by neuropathologists R.D. Terry and N. Gonatas (at A. Einstein in the 1960’s), with later samples taken as part of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug infusion study involving S. Mirra (at Emory in the 1980’s). They were re-examined by Ellisman, Masliah, Terry, and Mirra in the 1980s, using early 3D EM methods, and were found to manifest excellent preservation of ultrastructure, showing paired helical filaments (PHF) and amyloid accumulations as well as modifications to subcellular organelles and cytoskeletons of the cell bodies, axonal and dendritic processes. Here, we will exploit recent advances in high throughput, automated 3D EM to massively scale the examination of these precious samples, reconstructing 100s of brain cells with and without PHF, tracking axons (and mapping glia and synapses) through much greater brain volumes than was feasible previously. Our goal is to target areas associated with both plaques and tangles, attending to locations where existing findings suggest cell and network vulnerability and contain molecular interactions suspected by some to underlie the initiation and progression of AD. Supporting investigations into the progression of soma/dendritic degeneration, we will target cells operationally defined to represent a progression of neuronal decline as seen in AD; determining the volume fraction of PHF in the cytoplasm as a practical staging measure and linking this to the characterization of quantitative changes in the microstructure of major subcellular constituents. Likewise, we will analyze the progression of axonal degeneration in and near plaques as data obtained suggests that axons may become dystrophic before their parent cell bodies and their dendrites degenerate. NARRATIVE This project will expand the acquisition, reconstruction, analysis, and immediate dissemination of 3D electron microscopic (3D EM) reference data, disclosing key ultrastructural details preserved within a remarkable collection of legacy biopsy brain samples from patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).

"Understanding the protective and neuroinflammatory role of human brain immune cells in Alzheimer Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that deeply impacts the quality of life both socially and financially for affected ones and their relatives. Despite extensive clinical and genomic studies, the exact mechanisms of development and progression of AD remain elusive. Microglia and other myeloid origin cells, collectively known as human brain immune cells (HBICs), have been identified to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of AD. This is supported through genetic association studies, where many of the common and rare risk loci affect genes that are preferentially or selectively expressed in HBICs, emphasizing the pivotal role of the innate immune system in AD. In the parent grant 1R01AG065582, we utilize fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate CD45+/CD11b+ HBICs from human brain fresh tissue. We then apply innovative neurogenomics and single-cell approaches to generate comprehensive, high-throughput, multi-omics molecular profiles of HBICs from 300 donors at different stages of AD. These remarkable resources can provide critical insights into the role of immune cells in AD by increasing our mechanistic understanding of dysfunction in AD risk loci. One critical component that is currently not addressed in the parent grant is to apply innovative genomic approaches using AI/ML techniques, which can harmonize the signals from different omics modalities and offer a novel insight into the role of microglia and other immune cells in AD. In this Supplement, to increase the utility of the data, we propose to develop and maintain a shared resource of high-dimensional HBIC omics data for AI/ML applications. In addition, we propose to build a multi-scale integrative deep learning model leveraging single-cell omics data, to demonstrate the utility of the resource and serve as a benchmark for others to provide a quantitative measure of performance. This model will help us to identify protective and neuroinflammatory HBIC subpopulations and colocalize transcriptomic and regulatory signatures at different stages of AD. The proposed work will address potential challenges in the development of AI/ML applications. We propose: (1) identifying and removing potential sources of technical variations and normalize the data (2) uniformly processing and preparing fully annotated AI/ML-ready resource in a self- contained form for rapid prototyping with modern AI/ML tools (3) sharing and collaborating ideas using an open forum using AD knowledge base portal. Successful completion of the proposed studies will: (1) facilitate access to large-scale, multidimensional datasets on HBICs for AI/ML applications; (2) accelerate researches for an increased mechanistic understanding of the onset and progression of AD; (3) provide systems-level insights about transcriptional regulation in HBICs and AD pathogenesis using integrative AI/ML model; (4) provide a prioritized list of significant loci and genes for future mechanistic studies in AD. Together with exemplary systems- level analyses and annotations of these datasets for AI/ML-based research, it will provide to the scientific community an urgently needed resource. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease affecting 6.2M Americans, yet the exact disease mechanisms remain unknown. Human brain immune cells have been identified to play a critical role in the progression of AD, and therefore, extensive omics data have been generated to illuminate its role in AD. This application will transform multidimensional omics data generated from human brain immune cells, including single-cell molecular profiles, into AI/ML compatible shared data resources, accelerating the research about the etiopathogenetic mechanisms of immune cells on AD.",Understanding the protective and neuroinflammatory role of human brain immune cells in Alzheimer Disease,10412322,R01AG065582,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Etiology', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'ITGAM gene', 'Immune', 'Innate Immune System', 'Knowledge Portal', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Myelogenous', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'PTPRC gene', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'cloud storage', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data sharing networks', 'deep learning', 'genetic association', 'high dimensionality', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenomics', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'prototype', 'research based learning', 'risk variant', 'selective expression', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,338022
"Towards a better understanding of genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease with human iPSC models PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia with high heritability (~70%). It is increasingly clear that AD is highly polygenic, and for most of AD cases it is the polygenicity of the risk variants across the genome that predisposes the disease risk. In contrast to the rapid identification of risk loci associated with AD by recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), identifying the potential causal variants/genes at the reported risk loci and decoding these variants/genes into molecular and cellular pathology have lagged far behind. Since disease variants, mostly locating in noncoding regions of the human genome, have been shown to affect cellular function through multi-level regulations such as DNA accessibility and histone modifications, DNA methylation and RNA expression in a cell type-specific manner, comprehensive and unbiased investigating the cell type-specific influence of generic risk variants on AD risk at multiple levels, including epigenomic, transcriptomic, and cellular levels, in an isogenic background is crucial to understand the genetic basis of AD pathogenesis. In the current application, by combining human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with gene editing and comprehensive multi-omics and cellular analyses, we will dissect the AD genetic risk variants into cell type-specific molecular and cellular pathology. Given the polygenic nature of AD, and the heterogeneity of AD risk genes on the cellular level, we hypothesize that multiple genetic risk variants act synergistically among different compartments (e.g. cell types) to contribute to pathogenesis of AD. First, we will identify AD risk variants and genes with comprehensive analyses of AD genetic architecture using machine learning approaches including DVAR, eVAR and iRIGS (Aim 1). Second, we will delineate the cell type-specific epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures associated with AD candidate risk variants using human iPSC-derived neurons/microglia/astrocytes (Aim 2). Last, we will determine the functional impact of AD candidate risk variants on AD-like cellular pathology in neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and their co-cultures (Aim 3). Our proposal may advance our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of AD, leading to a better understanding of AD pathogenesis and facilitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia with high heritability. Although recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AD have identified more than 20 risk loci, the genetic etiology of AD leading to molecular and cellular pathology remains largely unknown. By combining human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with gene editing and comprehensive multi-omics and cellular analyses, our investigation will reveal the cell type-specific effects of AD genetic risk variants on AD pathogenesis, which may advance our understanding of genetic architecture of AD and disease etiology, and lead to therapeutic advances.",Towards a better understanding of genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease with human iPSC models,10231253,R01AG065611,"['ATAC-seq', 'Abeta synthesis', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer like pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Astrocytes', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Cell Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Conformation Capture and Sequencing', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human body', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium Mapping', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'brain tissue', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'cellular pathology', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'molecular pathology', 'multiple omics', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'risk variant', 'synaptic function', 'tau aggregation', 'tau phosphorylation', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,767099
"Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center 1. SUMMARY (Overall) The National Alzheimer's Project Act establishes an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's disease (AD); develop treatments to prevent, halt, or reverse the course of AD; improve the early diagnosis of AD; and decrease disparities in AD for ethnic and racial minority populations at higher risk for AD. In this context, AD is intended to encompass AD-related dementias, including dementia with Lewy bodies. In support of the goals and research milestones of the National Alzheimer's Project Act, the mission of the Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) is to serve as a shared resource to facilitate and enhance research on AD and the spectrum of cognitive impairment associated with Lewy body (LB) pathology. We follow a strategy of deep phenotyping, believing that critical answers emerge more readily when investigators are able to delve deeply within and across multiple levels of participant data. Healthy adults without cognitive or motor impairment serve both as a comparison (control) population and as a preclinical population in which mechanisms of cognitive aging and clinical transition can be studied. People with Parkinson's disease without cognitive impairment also serve as comparators and as an at-risk transitional population for the development of cognitive impairment linked to LB pathology. ADRC resources will provide investigators with unique opportunities for the parallel study of these two neurodegenerative disorders, enabling insights into pathogenesis, preclinical diagnosis, transitions, resistance and resilience, and therapeutic approaches. Aims of the Stanford ADRC are to (1) provide an administrative structure that advances the mission of the center; (2) develop and maintain human resources for studies of the AD spectrum and the LB spectrum of cognitive impairment, as well as cognitive aging; (3) make available well-characterized brain tissues, brain-derived biospecimens, and quantitative molecular data derived from high-content imaging of brain tissues; (4) make available participant biospecimens and high-content biospecimen data; (5) provide structural, functional, and molecular neuroimaging biomarkers in support of research on AD-spectrum cognitive impairment, LB-spectrum cognitive impairment, and cognitive aging; (6) provide for the management of Stanford ADRC data, prepare research datasets, provide high-level biostatistical consultation for ADRC investigators, and support research on big data using tools from biostatistics, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence; (7) with our community partners, provide respectful, culturally sensitive outreach and provide opportunities for education, training, and research participation for healthy adults, people with AD-spectrum and LB-spectrum disorders, and their families. Stanford ADRC outreach and community engagement extends particularly to urban Hispanic/Latino older adults, an important Bay Area population, which is under-represented in AD-related research; and (8) support the training of investigators and future leaders in the field of AD and related dementia.

"South Texas Alzheimer's Disease Center Alzheimer´s disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD) disproportionally impacts Hispanics/Latinos, who exhibit higher rates, earlier onset and face unique challenges due to cultural, linguistic, socioeconomic or healthcare access problems. Moreover, there is a shortage of researchers focused on ADRD in Mexican- American (MA) Hispanics, the fastest growing minority in the US. Addressing the heterogeneity of ADRD presentation and biology, using precision medicine approaches to improve risk prediction, target prevention and treatment is likely to improve outcomes for MA and others. The proposed South Texas Alzheimer disease Center (STAC) will exploit its unique geographic location in South Texas, a region of ~5 million, underserved MA to develop infrastructure and data/biosample collections that will support researchers from multiple disciplines to conduct research to diminish the burden of AD in Hispanics. We have 6 specific aims: (1) Collecting and sharing longitudinal data from patients, controls and caregivers (2) Exploring the biological heterogeneity of preclinical and clinical dementia, through deep phenotyping with clinical, imaging, genetic, omic, CSF, blood and sensory-motor biomarkers and autopsy of all these enrollees (3) Focusing especially for Aims #1 and #2 on Hispanic/Latino individuals (4) Identifying novel predictors/ biomarkers of dementia risk and resilience, including for poorly understood clinic-pathologic subgroups such as Suspected Non-Alzheimer (amyloid negative, neurodegeneration positive) Pathology [SNAP] in Hispanics with/without diabetes, (5) To recruit, train, mentor and support a diverse research workforce, largely women and minorities, to become leaders in multidisciplinary, team-based, ADRD research, (6) Bidirectional community education and engagement, research into knowledge, attitudes and practices/preferences. The STAC will develop and share culturally sensitive deep phenotyping methods beyond the Uniform Dataset (including novel cognitive, behavioral, vascular, lifestyle factors, biomarkers), genetics and multi- dimensional omics within community- based and patient and caregiver (dyadic) cohorts. Using state of the art clinical informatics and statistical methods, these rich data should permit an exploration of the molecular heterogeneity of ADRD and uncover novel biology and drug targets, treatment approaches. Finally we will collaborate, share data/samples and expertise with other institutions in Texas and around the world, especially other ADRC Centers, the NACC, NCRAD, NIAGADS. We will achieve these aims through creation of six required Cores and one component: Administrative, Clinical, Data Management and Statistical, Neuropathology, Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement, Biomarker Cores and the Research Education Component. In addition, we propose three Optional Cores: Population Neuroscience, Imaging and Genetics and Multiomics Cores. The STAC will serve as a national resource for disruptive, transformative and innovative research and the design, development, testing and implementation of practical strategies to diminish the burden of AD in Hispanics. Alzheimer´s disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD) disproportionately impacts Hispanics/Latinos, who represent the faster growing segment of the elderly population in the US and particularly in Texas. Building on longstanding strengths in clinical, epidemiological, biomedical, social and behavioral research at the Biggs Institute, University of Texas Health Sciences Center San Antonio (UTHSA) and facilitated by partnership with the University of Texas Rio Grande Valle (UTRGV), the South Texas Alzheimer´s disease Center (STAC) will lead novel precision, personalized medicine approaches to educate, support and improve prevention, treatment and care for patients with ADRD.

"Fast and robust deep learning tools for analysis of neuroimaging data of Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. Interventions at the preclinical and prodromal stages are appealing targets for slowing or halting disease progression. It is desired to achieve accurate prognosis of AD dementia and cognitive decline for people with mild cognitive impairment who have increased risk to develop AD. In order to achieve fast and accurate prognosis of AD dementia based on neuroimaging data, we will develop and validate novel deep learning techniques. Particularly, we will develop unsupervised deep learning methods for segmenting brain images and reconstructing cortical surfaces from structural magnetic resonance imaging data. These fast and accurate image processing methods will be used in conjunction with advanced deep learning methods to build prognosis models of AD dementia and cognitive decline in a time-to-event analysis framework using large-scale imaging datasets. Finally, we will develop and disseminate a user friendly, open source, modular, and extensible software package to improve prognosis of AD dementia. Source code, standalone programs, and web-application interfaces of all the algorithms will be made available on GitHub and NITRC. Our tools will enable real-time neuroimaging data analysis and can find applications in diverse fields, including quantifying brain changes associated with aging and development.

"Effects of Orally Administered Nicotinamide Riboside on Bioenergetic Metabolism, Oxidative Stress and Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild Alzheimer's Dementia Project Summary/Abstract  This study will serve as a supplement to the current NIA funded study “Effects of Orally Administered Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) on Bioenergetic Metabolism, Oxidative Stress and Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild Alzheimer’s Dementia”. The primary study will assess the effect of NR supplementation on oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels and downstream markers of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in the brain of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The study will use NAD+ and redox ratio changes as the primary outcome and changes in CK/ATPase activity and glutathione levels in the brain as the secondary outcome. The parent study will also assess the impact of NR supplementation on mood and functioning as measured by standardized tests of mood, cognition, and daily functioning. However, these outcome measures for these markers of clinical and functional status are all self- or observer-reported measures that are subject to associated limitations, including fewer data points, recall bias, responder bias, require the presence and engagement of an observer, and include no measures to capture variations using continuous measurement in vivo.  We propose a novel approach to augment the current outcome measures with continuous sensor data to facilitate digital phenotyping of functioning and mood using a sensor called Emerald. Emerald uses radio signals to map motion, spatial location and sleep patterns in patients with AD and requires no direct interaction or contact and can collect continuous passive behavioral data. Customized machine-learning algorithms will extract (i) sleep efficiency, (ii) gait speed, and (iii) diurnal rhythm. The Emerald device can also track spatial location within the living environment and quantify levels and patterns of motion, which in turn are markers of psychomotor activity. These variables will facilitate a continuous, temporally dense and highly ecologically valid assessment of day-to-day variations in functioning to augment the data currently being collected. Sensor data will also allow continuous longitudinal mapping of behavioral/functional changes and comparison of trends of change in each individual variable.  We will deploy the Emerald device in the living environment of consenting study subjects and collect data on sleep and behavior for the duration of their enrolment in the parent trial. While the study requires visits at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks, the Emerald will track functioning and mood between visits, chronological patterns of behavior, and functional change in response to NR administration. The Emerald device will be deployed in forty study participants. Due to the small sample size, this is exploratory, but the data generated using digital phenotyping will enable us to develop and test hypotheses about the relationship between NR supplementation, bioenergetics/oxidative stress, imaging markers, and real-world functioning/clinical outcomes in future studies of AD and mild cognitive impairment. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Emerald device passively gathers continuous data on motion, spatial location, psychomotor activity, and sleep patterns in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), allowing longitudinal mapping of their behavioral and functional changes over time. Machine learning algorithms will extract patients’ sleep efficiency, gait speed, and diurnal rhythms to assess changes in their behavior and functioning, capturing in vivo variations possibly attributable to nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation. This administrative supplement will enable us to develop and test hypotheses about the relationship between NR supplementation, bioenergetics and oxidative stress, imaging markers, and real-world functioning/clinical outcomes that will benefit future studies of AD.","Effects of Orally Administered Nicotinamide Riboside on Bioenergetic Metabolism, Oxidative Stress and Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild Alzheimer's Dementia",10394467,R01AG066670,"['ATP phosphohydrolase', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Bed Occupancy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'COVID-19', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diurnal Rhythm', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gait speed', 'Glutathione', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'NADH', 'Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Protocols documentation', 'Questionnaires', 'Radio', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Standardization', 'Study Subject', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'daily functioning', 'digital', 'functional independence', 'functional status', 'handheld mobile device', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'nicotinamide riboside supplementation', 'nicotinamide-beta-riboside', 'novel strategies', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'serial imaging', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep pattern', 'standardize measure', 'tool', 'trend', 'wearable device']",NIA,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,313981
"Endophenotype Network-based Approaches to Prediction and Population-based Validation of In Silico Drug Repurposing for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Although researchers have conducted more than 400 human trials for potential treatments of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the last two decades, the attrition rate is estimated at over 99%. Furthermore, the “one gene, one drug, one disease” reductionism-informed paradigm overlooks the inherent complexity of the disease and continues to challenge drug discovery for AD. The predisposition to AD involves a complex, polygenic, and pleiotropic genetic architecture. Recent studies have suggested that AD often has common underlying mechanisms and pathobiology, sharing intermediate endophenotypes with many other complex diseases. These endophenotypes, such as amyloidosis, tauopathy and neuroinflammation, have essential roles in many neurodegenerative diseases. Systematic identification and characterization of novel underlying pathogenesis and endophenotype networks, more so than mutated genes, will serve as a foundation for generating actionable targets as input for drug repurposing and rational design of combination therapy in AD. Integration of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and the human interactome using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are essential for such identification. Given our preliminary results, we posit that AI/ML-based identification of likely risk genes and endophenotype network modules offer unexpected opportunities for drug repurposing and combination therapy design in AD compared to traditional single-target approaches. To address the underlying hypothesis, we propose to establish an AI/ML-based, multimodal analytic framework to repurpose existing genetics, genomics and transcriptomics data generated from NIA-funded AD genome sequencing projects for druggable target identification with two specific aims under the scope of the parent R01 (#R01AG066707). The central unifying hypothesis of this Supplement project is that a genome-wide, AI/ML infrastructure that enables users searching, sharing, visualizing, querying, and analyzing multi-omics (including genetics and genomics) findings can enable emerging development of molecularly targeted treatments for AD. Aim 1 will test common variant-based risk gene and endophenotype network hypothesis in AD using multi-omics evidence aggregation under a multiple kernel learning framework and the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable digital objects) principles. We will develop and apply AI/ML approach to identify likely risk genes and endophenotype networks though leveraging genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data from AD Sequencing Project (ADSP), the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), NIAGADS, and the AD knowledge portal. Aim 2 will test cell type-specific risk genes and anti-inflammatory endophenotype network hypothesis in AD using a network-based deep learning framework. Following FAIR principles, we will implement command-line and web portal to disseminate all AI/ML toolboxes and AI/ML-ready gene/network data from Aims 1 and 2 into the AD knowledge portal and the Cleveland Clinic-IBM Quantum computing platform for accelerating future AD genetic and multi-omics data analyses, an essential goal of the Alzheimer’s precision medicine. 1 Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, while the current disease incidence indicates approximately 13.8 million Americans will be affected by 2050 without disease-modifying treatments. This proposal will develop artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools, capable of searching human genome sequencing findings and existing drug-target databases for novel AD drug target identification and therapeutic development. The innovative AI/ML toolboxes developed in this proposal will offer powerful approaches for NIH-funded multi-omics data analyses and the AI/ML-identified druggable targets will prove to be novel and effective ways for emerging development of molecularly targeted therapies in AD. 1",Endophenotype Network-based Approaches to Prediction and Population-based Validation of In Silico Drug Repurposing for Alzheimer's Disease,10409194,R01AG066707,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'American', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chromatin', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Data', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'FAIR principles', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Immunologic Tests', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Portal', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutate', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predisposition', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computational platform', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'drug repurposing', 'druggable target', 'endophenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human genome sequencing', 'human interactome', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kernel methods', 'molecular drug target', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'protein protein interaction', 'quantum computing', 'research and development', 'risk variant', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'user-friendly', 'web portal']",NIA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2021,322000
"Complexity of FMRI in Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Considerable efforts have been spent in the past two decades to search for biomarkers for pre-symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For neuroimaging, amyloid-PET imaging of amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is considered an early marker for the preclinical stage of AD, while tau-PET imaging correlates more closely with neuronal injury and cognitive decline. However, PET scans are expensive and involve radioactive tracers. Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) studies in AD have shown that the functional connectivity (FC) of resting brain networks is progressively diminished in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. However, FC analysis of rs-fMRI has limited capability to characterize the dynamic fluctuations of rs-fMRI signals that possess clinically meaningful information. Our group and others have recently explored the use of entropy measures as indices of the complexity and regularity of rs-fMRI time-series. Accumulating data showed decreasing entropy values associated with aging, APOE ɛ4 genotype, cognitive decline in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD). Our group began developing the Complexity Toolbox in 2013 as the first systematic and comprehensive software package dedicated to complexity analysis of neuroimaging (fMRI) data. In particular, a recent independent study using our toolbox to analyze the rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study reported progressive reductions of entropy from healthy controls, early MRI, to late MCI and AD groups, with significant associations between complexity measures of rs-fMRI and cognitive decline in MCI/AD subjects. Our preliminary data in ADAD and LOAD subjects further showed consistent negative correlations between rs-fMRI entropy and tau-PET signal. The goal of this project is to further develop our Complexity Toolbox and a cloud-based pipeline for comprehensive complexity analysis of (large scale) fMRI data. We will systematically evaluate the complexity of fMRI as a novel imaging marker of AD in both ADAD and LOAD populations, using 3 public databases of rs- fMRI and PET including Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), Connectome of ADAD, and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3) with a total sample size >900. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning techniques to evaluate complexity of rs-fMRI as a predictor for transversion from healthy to MCI and to AD. We will generate a disease staging model based on multimodal AD biomarkers including PET, CSF and rs-fMRI measures. We hypothesize that the complexity of BOLD signals provides an index of the information processing capacity of regional neuron populations, and is therefore sensitive to tau- related neuronal injury and cognitive decline in the AD processes. The successful completion of this project will lead to a noninvasive, economical and alternative imaging biomarker of neuronal injury in MCI and AD with relevant tools ready to be deployed in clinical research and care of AD. Relevance to Public Health Biomarkers for pre-clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have become increasingly important for the development of preventative interventions. For neuroimaging, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau protein provide early imaging markers of AD and can track disease progression but are expensive and require the use of radioactive tracers. This project aims to develop and evaluate a noninvasive, quantitative and economical imaging marker of AD based on the complexity or regularity of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).",Complexity of FMRI in Alzheimer's Disease,10137871,R01AG066711,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Entropy', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inherited', 'Ions', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radioactive Tracers', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'abeta accumulation', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'autosomal dominant Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'functional MRI scan', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'mutation carrier', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preventive intervention', 'tau Proteins', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,653961
"Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network (PeCAN) Program for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias ABSTRACT Our healthcare system faces larger numbers of individuals with early to late Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders requiring anesthesia associated procedures for serious health related conditions (e.g., cardiac), screening (e.g., colonoscopy), or quality of life improvement (e.g., joint replacement). Despite evidence that preoperative cognitive status is a risk factor for negative post-operative outcomes, there is a scarcity of research addressing perioperative cognitive-biomarker-anesthesia interactions, and evidence based anesthesia-surgical practices for patients with prodromal or diagnosed dementias. The K07 applicant- an NIH funded independent investigator and board certified neuropsychologist with expertise in the cognitive sequelae and associated neuroimaging markers of AD, vascular dementia, and other neurodegenerative disorders, and cognitive and neuroimaging predictors of perioperative cognitive complications and delirium. The applicant (with support of the institution) is proposing a Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network (PeCAN) Program for AD and related dementia. The purpose– to promote institutional and community awareness of cognition and memory in older adults electing surgical procedures with anesthesia, intensify collaborations on AD biomarkers- anesthesia interactions, and promote translation of research findings to clinical care. The applicant will complete advanced leadership training and three programmatic aims. Aim 1- convene a multidisciplinary advisory team to establish four integrated PeCAN research cores targeting AD and related dementia perioperative research. Cores include a Cognitive-Clinical Core, a Neuroimaging Core, a Biomarker Core, and a Data Science Core. Aim 2- enhance defined and supportive pathways to the PeCAN cores so that early stage investigators can efficiently initiate and complete perioperative-neurodegenerative research. The applicant will integrate pathways between multiple institutional resources including NIH funded 1Florida Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute, the University of Florida (UF) Institute on Aging Pepper Center, and the UF Fixel Center for Neurological Diseases. Aim 3- promote the emergence of highly trained scientists and educators for innovative team science addressing perioperative neuronal risk and mechanisms for protection. Methods will involve implementation of a certificate program, interdisciplinary team-science research opportunities, and pilot funding supported through this grant and institutional matching funds. Trainees will initially include appropriate predoctoral T32 trainees, neuropsychology fellows, and anesthesiology fellows. Milestones- annual analyses of programmatic strengths/weaknesses, multidisciplinary proposal submissions, and evidence of trainee success with perioperative research for AD and related dementias.  Narrative Despite expected exponential increases in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, and an overabundance of research indicating that preoperative cognitive impairment is a major risk factor for negative post-operative outcome, we know very little of AD cognitive, biomarker, and anesthesia/surgical interactions and have little to no evidence-based perioperative medical care strategies for AD patients. Via the K07 mechanism and institutional support, the applicant will leverage novel perioperative clinical and state-of-the-art institutional facilities to develop an institutional wide research and training program addressing these problems. The proposed program will result in improved awareness of cognition and memory status in older adults prior to surgical procedures with anesthesia, intensify collaborative research addressing brain-behavior-anesthesia interactions through both animal and human research approaches, and promote translation of research findings to clinical care.",Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network (PeCAN) Program for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias,10141175,K07AG066813,"['Academic/Teacher Award', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animals', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Capsicum', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Delirium', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Face', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pecans', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Ventricular', 'White Matter Disease', 'brain behavior', 'brain health', 'certificate program', 'clinical care', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'curriculum development', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal human study', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'older patient', 'postoperative delirium', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'symposium', 'trend']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K07,2021,162000
"Artificial Intelligence Strategies for Alzheimer's Disease Research Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common disease that is partly due to protein misfolding and aggregation. Research on AD is a national priority with 5.5 million Americans affected at an annual cost of more than $250 billion and no available cure. This is despite heavy investments in the collection of diverse clinical and biological data in experimental and population-based studies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have the potential to reveal patterns in clinical and multi-source large-scale Alzheimer’s data that have not been found using standard approaches. We propose here a comprehensive biomedical computing and health informatics research project to develop and apply cutting-edge AI algorithms and biomedical software for the analysis of large- scale AD data. At the heart of this proposed informatics program is the PennAI method and software for automating machine learning through an AI algorithm that can learn from prior analyses. This approach takes the guesswork out of picking the right machine learning algorithms and parameter settings thus making this computing technology accessible to everyone. Specifically, we will develop three novel informatics methods to tailor PennAI to the analysis of AD data. First, we will develop a Multi-Modal Interaction (M2I) feature selection algorithm for identifying genetic interactions that are predictive of AD (AIM 1). Second, we will develop a Knowledge-driven Multi-omics Integration (KMI) algorithm for combining omics features for AI analysis of AD (AIM 2). Third, we will develop a Multidimensional Brain Imaging Omics (MBIO) integration framework for the joint analysis of multi-source large-scale data for predicting AD. Finally, we will integrate all three biomedical informatics methods into our open-source PennAI software package and apply it to two large population-based studies of AD. We expect PennAI will reveal new biomarkers for AD that will open the door for better treatments and clinical decision support. There have been no new FDA-approved drugs for Alzheimer’s disease in more than 20 years. The goal of this project is to develop artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for extracting unforeseen patterns from clinical, genetic, genomic, and imaging data that could lead to ideas for new drug development. Our proposed AI methods and software will be open-source, user-friendly, and freely available for all to use.",Artificial Intelligence Strategies for Alzheimer's Disease Research,10142934,R01AG066833,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'FDA approved', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population Study', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'programs', 'protein aggregation', 'protein misfolding', 'user-friendly']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,1609384
"Exploring Common Biological Pathways Underlying Insulin Resistance and Alzheimer Disease using Genetic and Omic Tools Project Summary / Abstract Insulin resistance (IR) is a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but the mechanisms by which IR predisposes to AD is unknown, notably, if IR is causally related to AD and which regulatory mechanisms underlie IR and contribute to AD. The proposal is designed to address these critical gaps in scientific knowledge by using omics to evaluate the causal relationship of IR on AD and to reveal new regulatory mechanisms involved in IR and AD. The Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Sarnowski, is a statistical geneticist and an early career investigator with a research focus on the identification of genetic and environmental risk factors of complex traits. The long-term goal of this project is to identify individuals who will benefit from treatments improving insulin sensitivity to better prevent, delay or stop the progression of AD. The overall objective is to better characterize mechanisms by which IR contributes to AD and evaluate how they may differ from known mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis. The central hypothesis is that omics will help to better understand and characterize the relationships between IR and AD. The rationale is that omics will help to disentangle the mode of action of IR on AD and identify targets for preventive and therapeutic interventions. Guided by strong preliminary results in the Framingham Heart Study, the hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims: 1) Determine if IR is causally related to AD in a Mendelian Randomization (MR) framework with various genetic instrument variables (IVs); 2) Characterize molecular signatures of IR associated with AD using brain and blood omic data; and 3) Develop a joint test to evaluate the genetic contribution at IR signatures associated with AD. In Aim 1, genetic IVs, including standard and pathway-specific genetic risk scores and predictors identified by machine learning, will be constructed to evaluate the causal relationships between IR and AD using various MR methods. In Aim 2, association analyses will be performed to identify brain and blood omic signatures of IR related to AD. In Aim 3, new integrative statistical methods leveraging annotations will be developed to evaluate the genetic contribution on omics at loci involved in IR and AD. Career development activities will include training in AD pathophysiology, multi-omic analysis and machine learning techniques through coursework, seminars, mentorship, and collaborations with a team of leading expert scientists. The approach is innovative by shifting focus to omics to study the regulatory mechanisms involved in IR and AD. The proposed research is significant as the expected outcomes will contribute to a better understanding of how insulin sensitivity can be improved to better prevent, delay or stop the progression of AD, reduce cognitive decline and prevalence of dementia due to AD, and promote brain health in late life. The experience acquired in achieving the aims of this grant will advance the PI’s career to an independent statistical geneticist with bioinformatics expertise, to dissect how vascular risk factors interact with genomics to influence AD and dementia susceptibility using large-scale omics. Project Narrative This research project aims to better characterize the biological mechanisms involved in insulin resistance and their role in Alzheimer’s disease. The proposed research is relevant to public health as it is expected to provide new ways to prevent, delay or treat Alzheimer’s disease, by targeting insulin sensitivity. Thus, the project is relevant to the part of the NIH’s mission that pertains to improving fundamental knowledge that will help to reduce the burdens of complex human diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.",Exploring Common Biological Pathways Underlying Insulin Resistance and Alzheimer Disease using Genetic and Omic Tools,10126565,K99AG066849,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Apoptosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Bypass', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Annotation', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic resistance', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genomic locus', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'insulin sensitivity', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'preventive intervention', 'programs', 'religious order study', 'tau Proteins', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'vascular risk factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K99,2021,89564
"Preclinical markers of Alzheimer's disease using psycholinguistic semantic measures PROJECT ABSTRACT The clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on the core criterion of memory impairment, but biomarker-detectable pathophysiological changes start decades before clinical symptoms. This preclinical phase, in which someone has the neuropathology of AD but does not yet show clinical symptoms, is crucial for potential intervention and timely diagnosis for patient and caregiver. The preclinical phase is currently only detectable with expensive or invasive biomarkers. Because current cognitive measures are not sensitive to the preclinical phase of AD and have low specificity and large variation with regard to individuals' educational and cultural exposure, there is a critical need to develop sensitive, low-cost, and high-access cognitive markers for early detection in diverse older adults. The primary goal of this project is to investigate if novel psycholinguistic metrics of existing cognitive test data can accurately identify people in the earliest stages of AD. The semantic fluency task—naming as many animals in one minute—tests semantic memory, one of the first cognitive domains to become impaired in AD. Traditionally, semantic fluency is scored by the total number of items. However, there is a wealth of information at the item-level of this task, because words are organized in a semantic network that becomes vulnerable during AD, specifically for words that are poorly connected and not often used. These traits of words in the semantic network can be captured with novel psycholinguistic metrics, such as lexical frequency, e.g., `dog' is a high-frequent word in our language, as opposed to `iguana.' Nine novel item-level psycholinguistic metrics of semantic fluency have been selected to: investigate how AD imaging biomarkers in nondemented adults relate to psycholinguistic measures (Aim 1, K99); estimate the temporality of semantic impairment across the AD continuum (Aim 2, R00); and determine the sensitivity and specificity of psycholinguistic measures to predict progression to clinical AD (Aim 3, R00). Since the relationship of demographics to psycholinguistic metrics is not well understood, this project strives to deconstruct cultural and demographic effects on these metrics in order to maximize their potential utility in early diagnosis among diverse older adults. The project will employ advanced statistical analyses to investigate data from three large longitudinal cohorts with diverse participants and semantic fluency data in English, Spanish, and Dutch. This K99/R00 proposal lays the foundation for an independent research program focused on semantic processing in normal aging and across the AD continuum. The proposed project will provide the applicant with 1) new training in computational semantics and structural equation modeling, 2) experience with imaging biomarker data, and 3) a strong foundation in cultural neuropsychology. These experiences will supplement the applicant's strong background in Neurolinguistics and Epidemiology. The results of the proposed research have the potential to translate into a clinical tool that we can use across educationally, linguistically, and culturally diverse individuals to refine who to select for intervention trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE The number of individuals with clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rapidly increasing worldwide due to aging of the population, but current cognitive measures lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to detect subtle decline within the preclinical phase. There is a critical need for tools that are sensitive to AD neuropathology during the preclinical phase that are low-cost, high-access, and fast to administer that can be used across educationally, linguistically, and culturally diverse older individuals. The goal of this project is to identify metrics for semantic impairment in diverse individuals that correlate with AD neuropathology and predict clinical decline.",Preclinical markers of Alzheimer's disease using psycholinguistic semantic measures,10150738,K99AG066934,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animals', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological Markers', 'Canis familiaris', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Demographic Factors', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Episodic memory', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hispanics', 'Iguanas', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory impairment', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Race', 'Research', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Work', 'age effect', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early detection biomarkers', 'experience', 'gender difference', 'imaging biomarker', 'lexical', 'mutation carrier', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropathology', 'non-demented', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prognostic model', 'programs', 'semantic processing', 'sex', 'tool', 'trait']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2021,130841
"Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias that are associated with major adverse effects on daily function and quality of life, and accelerate time to institutionalization. Of all the NPS, depression is the most frequently observed symptom in people with mild cognitive impairment and early AD. As the disease progresses, agitation, delusions and hallucinations become more common, whereas apathy is the most persistent and frequent NPS throughout all the stages of AD. AD-NPS share some clinical features with serious mental illnesses (SMIs), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, but whether these conditions share similar aethiopathies is unclear. Given that reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias do not exist, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses is a critical next step to identify reliable biomarkers that could lead to novel therapeutics.  There are two overarching goals of this proposal. First, we will identify the molecular mechanisms and neuropathological changes that are associated with the presence of NPS in patients with AD. Second, we will examine if the mechanisms of pathology associated with NPS are shared or distinct among AD and SMIs. More specifically, we propose to build multi-scale integrative models using phenomics and genomics data from 1,264 autopsy cases derived from a single brain bank. The bank includes detailed phenomics data such as well characterized NPS, clinical diagnosis (AD and other neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric traits), severity of cognitive decline and neuropathology for each patient sample. From each case, we will apply innovative approaches that reduce the cost and technical biases associated with conventional methods, and capture gene expression signatures and epigenetic regulatory elements at the single-cell level. Novel deep-learning methods will be applied for the multi-scale integration of neuropathologic changes with genetic markers and functional genomic changes (such as changes in gene expression and enhancer sequences) within specific cell types, to predict various NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric traits; we refer to these integrative models as genotype- marker-phenotype models. We expect that these models will enable us to assign genotypes and molecular markers to specific NPS within AD and other neuropsychiatric traits at the single-cell level, an unprecedented level of resolution. In addition, we will test the translational potential of the genotype-marker-phenotype models to predict AD-NPS using independent large-scale biobank datasets, in which genotypes and electronic health records are available. Successful completion of the proposed studies will have immediate utility by generating potential biomarkers for NPS diagnosis and prognosis and by providing predictive models for patient stratification in clinical trials. In the longer term, our models will help us create a blueprint for therapeutic strategies and interventions to treat NPS in AD. PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, that contributes to early institutionalization and causes substantial caregiving and caregiver burden. Despite decades of research, reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias have not been found. The proposed studies will generate and integrate high-dimensional phenomics and genomics data in human brain tissue, that will inform us about the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in the context of AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses.",Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease,10174690,R01AG067025,"['Adverse effects', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epitopes', 'Factor Analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutionalization', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of life', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'brain tissue', 'care giving burden', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular marker', 'neuropathology', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'severe mental illness', 'therapeutically effective', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,1831622
"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate multi-modal neuroimaging to quantify the heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects over 5 million Americans posing a significant burden to the community and health care system. Machine learning (ML) methods have been crucial in detecting the disease and characterizing its progression. Due to the lack of an in vivo “ground truth” diagnosis, ML approaches have typically relied on clinically derived labels and a case-control design in their search for a single imaging pattern that optimally distinguishes between the two groups in the case-control design. However, heterogeneity within clinical labels may degrade performance and interpretability. The goal of this project is to address this limitation and accurately characterize heterogeneity in preclinical and symptomatic AD. Given that age is a major risk factor for developing dementia, we will characterize healthy aging using multimodal neuroimaging data and ML in Aim 1. To this end, we propose to develop a novel unsupervised multi-view machine learning tool that can integrate information from multiple imaging modalities (i.e., structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and amyloid and tau sensitive Positron Emission Tomography) in a principled way. This will enable us to define the normal trajectory of age- related changes across all modalities, providing the necessary context to understand AD pathology. We will characterize AD pathology using multimodal neuroimaging data and ML in Aim 2. To this end, we propose to develop a novel semi-supervised ML framework that integrates multimodal information and derives data-driven disease dimensions. This is achieved by identifying and quantifying at the individual level imaging patterns that capture neuroanatomical and neuropathological alterations. Our approach builds on our extensive prior work on using an advanced, unsupervised multivariate pattern analysis technique, termed orthonormal projective non-negative matrix factorization, for analyzing neuroimaging data. Importantly, our project leverages two large multimodal datasets, the Knight AD Research Center (ADRC) cohort and AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which sample participants across the continuum of AD making them ideal for investigating heterogeneity of AD pathology using advanced ML techniques. If successful, our approaches could be used for studying any brain disorder and could be readily integrated into personalized medicine strategies in the future when rich, multimodal imaging data collection will become a routine diagnostic procedure in hospitals. Project narrative Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects over 5 million Americans posing a significant burden to the community and health care system. Measurements of anatomy derived from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as well as measurements abnormal amyloid and tau protein depositions derived from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are increasingly used in AD research. In this project, we propose to develop advanced machine learning methods that can integrate information from PET and MRI toward characterizing disease heterogeneity in preclinical and symptomatic AD. This can improve our understanding of the underlying biological causes of the disease, leading to improved diagnosis and prognosis as well as therapeutic innovation by enabling patient stratification for clinical trials.",Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate multi-modal neuroimaging to quantify the heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease,10121679,R01AG067103,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Anatomy', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Enabling Factors', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'case control', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'community burden', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder subtype', 'healthy aging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'quantitative imaging', 'supervised learning', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,535629
"SCAN: Standardized Centralized Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Neuroimaging PROJECT SUMMARY Amyloid PET is central to a biological definition of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and has been integrated heavily into the research setting since the first PIB-PET scans in 2004. The SCAN-Amyloid Legacy (SCAN-AL) Project will leverage already established research programs (SCAN, NACC, LONI) along with extensive work that has been conducted over the previous 15 years at the ADRC site level to implement and collect expensive and valuable amyloid PET data on ADRC research participants. The ultimate goal of this effort is to curate and harmonize pre-existing amyloid PET data collected across ADRC sites to create a large-scale resource that can be disseminated to the ADRC community for use in various research endeavors. More specifically, during this award period we will aim to curate 3000 amyloid PET scans, which is similar to the number of amyloid PET scans currently available through ADNI, and to link this data to extensive data already available on these participants (clinical and cognitive data, biofluid data, postmortem data, etc). Whereas the parent SCAN award focuses on processing of prospective PET and MRI data utilizing rigorous standardization methods both during image acquisition and post-acquisition processing, SCAN-AL will allow more flexibility to enable the specific goal of obtaining legacy amyloid PET data on as many unique ADRC Clinical Core participants as possible. This work is significant because we are quickly approaching 2025 and still lack a disease modifying treatment for AD. The data leveraging proposed herein extends the value of the considerable funding has been directed towards cohort studies of AD to contribute towards this goal of curing AD by 2025. Increasing the utilization of pre-existing amyloid PET dataset across ADRCs is particularly significant and unique compared to other large-scale efforts such as ADNI, given the heterogeneity in ADRC participants both in terms of clinical diagnoses and demographics. Whereas ADNI focuses specifically on normal aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD diagnoses, the ADRC program recruits participants spanning a range of neurodegenerative diseases that reflect the focus and expertise of local investigators, such as vascular disease, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, Parkinson’s, etc. Further, the ADRC program is unique in that a broad range of demographics regarding race, ethnicity, and age are reflected. We anticipate that the SCAN-AL Project will contribute to timely scientific opportunities related to the validation of plasma AD biomarkers, support innovative analyses that require large datasets such as work with genetics and machine learning, as well as enable the investigation of rare phenotypes that are difficult to collect at one site alone. This effort will provide ample opportunities to AD investigators and complement the efforts of the SCAN initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE (no changes from original submission) The field of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research has entered the era of “big data”, where large, multicenter data sets have contributed greatly to our understanding of the clinical variability, epidemiology, and genetics of the disease. This project will create an infrastructure for obtaining standardized brain images that can be combined across the 30 Alzheimer’s Disease Centers to create a very large database. Because imaging has become an integral part of the assessment of patients with AD, this work will advance our capabilities for performing high quality research on virtually any topic in this field that is related to brain imaging.",SCAN: Standardized Centralized Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Neuroimaging,10335694,U24AG067418,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Certification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Consent Forms', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injections', 'Investigation', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Sum', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tracer', 'Traction', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'amyloid pathology', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'corticobasal syndrome', 'data sharing', 'demographics', 'disease phenotype', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tau Proteins', 'virtual', 'willingness']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U24,2021,641593
"Statistical Models of Alzheimer's Disease Pathological Cascade Abstract Enormous effort has been made to uncover the series of changes in biomarkers along Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiological pathway and its later clinical manifestations. The most influential hypothetical model proposed by Jack and colleagues has greatly shaped AD research in the past decade, whereas it remains a hypothesis to be validated. The key challenge in the validation is the fact that AD pathophysiological process is not directly observable. The temporal biomarker profile is therefore usually examined against discrete clinical diagnoses, estimated years from clinical symptom onset or test score of cognitive impairment – neither is a good measure of the AD pathogenic process, but merely clinical consequences that have been shown to vary greatly among individuals and also to be affected by other diseases. In this proposal, we will tackle this topic in the following aspects. (1) We will develop appropriate statistical models that directly address the unobservable nature of the AD pathophysiological process and therefore provide the foundation to operationalize and validate hypothetical AD biomarker models. (2) We will utilize data across multiple AD database to provide data-based evidence on the AD biomarker cascade and its clinical manifestations, as well as inform the link between the newly proposed biological AD definition in the 2018 NIA-AA research guideline and the current syndromic AD definition. (3) We will develop a statistical framework for dynamic prediction of AD pathophysiological progression trajectory and its clinical manifestations based on the history of a patient’s biomarker profiles. (4) We will develop a web-based application that allows for expedited delivery of statistical learning into practice. Although the scientific questions are focused, the proposed statistical model is applicable to many observational studies with longitudinal, multivariate biomarker measures to capture an unobservable structure, such as in aging or mental health studies. Narrative The project develops appropriate statistical methodologies to evaluate temporal biomarker changes along a pathophysiological process that cannot be directly observed, bridge the gap between a rigorous evaluation and the practical constraints using existing data sources, and attempt to provide individualized prediction of a patient’s future progression trajectory and associated clinical manifestations based on the biomarker history of this patient. Methods are motivated by the need to understand the series of changes in biomarkers along the Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiological pathway during the asymptotic stage and its later clinical manifestations, but can be applied to many biomarker studies where the outcome is not directly observable, such as in aging or mental health studies.",Statistical Models of Alzheimer's Disease Pathological Cascade,10260514,R01AG068002,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention Trial', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sigmoid colon', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'multiple data sources', 'neuroimaging', 'patient biomarkers', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'research and development', 'semiparametric', 'software development', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'therapeutic development', 'user-friendly']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,409375
"Advancing drug repositioning and development for Alzheimer's Disease using functional genomics and computational phenomics PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder which is highly prevalent in the global population, affecting around 46 million individuals. Due to increased longevity, the prevalence is rising. AD is characterized pathophysiologically by extracellular β- amyloid deposition and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau. Current medications for AD provide some relief from disease symptoms but are not effective in all patients while severe side effects are observed. The disease is highly heritable and has a complex molecular basis, with a substantial polygenic component. There is an urgent need for developing approaches to target discovery and drug repurposing. The combination of methodological analytic advances, functional genomics data, and phenotype-rich datasets can be the foundation for identifying new therapies. Our central hypothesis is that an integrative approach spanning human phenomics and genomics will offer new AD therapeutic possibilities, including drug repositioning, and provide a powerful approach to drug target discovery. We will develop cutting-edge genetics-anchored computational methodologies for AD drug repurposing, generate a community resource to advance research in AD therapeutics development, leverage a collaboration (infrastructure and machine learning) with Google, and conduct target validation in a zebrafish model of AD. We have engaged an interdisciplinary team to ensure the success and broad impact of our proposal and lay the groundwork for future innovative research. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance We will develop cutting-edge genetics-anchored computational methodologies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) drug repurposing, generate a community resource to advance research in AD therapeutics development, leverage a collaboration (infrastructure and machine learning) with Google, and conduct target validation in a zebrafish model of AD.",Advancing drug repositioning and development for Alzheimer's Disease using functional genomics and computational phenomics,10459749,R56AG068026,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Animal Model', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Liver', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proxy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spleen', 'Symptoms', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'Zebrafish', 'abeta deposition', 'advanced analytics', 'biobank', 'brain cell', 'causal variant', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'extracellular', 'functional genomics', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'human disease', 'hyperphosphorylated tau', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'side effect', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'trait', 'transcriptome']",NIA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R56,2021,755981
"Ultrascale Machine Learning to Empower Discovery in Alzheimers Disease Biobanks ABSTRACT In response to PAR-19-269 “Cognitive Systems Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Genetic and Phenotypic Data (U01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)”, our project unites experts in AD genomics, machine learning and AI (including deep learning), large-scale data integration, and international data harmonization to work in a carefully-designed Consortium Structure in close partnership with the NIH, ADSP, and NIAGADS. We will develop a suite of complementary big data analytic approaches for ultra-scale analysis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) genomic and phenotypic data. The vast data volumes now generated by the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Accelerating Medications Partnership AD (AMP-AD), and UK Biobank (UKBB), far exceed the capacity of all current analytic methods, which have not kept pace with the scale and speed of data collection. This vast amount of genetic and phenotypic data mandates new and more powerful algorithms to: (1) store, manage, and manipulate whole-genome sequences and associated data on an ever-growing scale; (2) discover novel AD risk and protective loci by merging informatics and AD genomics databases; (3) relate whole-genome changes to the ATN(v) biomarkers that now define biological AD. Our Ultrascale Machine Learning Initiative, or “ULTRA” - will offer new AI and deep learning tools to discover features in massive scale genomics data - relating whole genome data to biomarker features by merging all relevant data sources. Our team of experienced PIs will coordinate efforts across the U.S. to create these large-scale data analytic tools. Our MPI team and 6 Core Leads have decades of experience working together and with the AD community in pioneering machine learning methods for AD genetics and neuroimaging, including leadership of international neuroimaging consortia across the world. Dedicated Cores focus on Genomic, Imaging, and Cognitive Data Harmonization. Curated data will then be efficiently imported into AI approaches and informatics pipelines that will allow the AD research community to leverage ultra-scale, multidimensional genomic and phenotypic data from the ADSP, NACC, ADNI, AMP-AD, and others. Our work is organized by a carefully-designed and coordinated Consortium guided by all stake-holders, clinical leaders, and pioneering analysts in AD genomics and neuroimaging. Our ultrascale AI tools will advance AD genomics research and will include efforts in training, and a dedicated Drug Repurposing Core. This team effort will accelerate understanding of the genetic, molecular and neurobiological mechanisms of AD, yielding significant translational impact on disease and drug development. NARRATIVE Our Ultrascale Machine Learning Initiative, or “ULTRA” - is a coordinated national initiative to develop transformative AI approaches for high throughput analysis of next generation sequencing (NGS) and related AD biomarker and cognitive data. Biomarker data related to AD are being collected at “ultra-scale” and are likely to unlock numerous opportunities for AD treatment, yet the rapid collection of such data far exceed our current capacity to analyze it.

"Cognitive Computing of Alzheimer's Disease Genes and Risk Cognitive Computing of Alzheimer’s Disease Genes and Risk The molecular basis and genetic architecture of dementia remain a puzzle. As no drug yet prevents, delays, or reverses it, aging populations potentially face a tidal threat of incipient and socially disruptive Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) cases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked over 100 loci with AD and explain much of population attributable risk, but only a fraction of heritability. This heritability gap means it remains difficult to design and assess which surveillance, screening, preventive, and stratification programs are effective. In turn, this hinders therapeutic trials. The challenge in translating genetic variants into patient classifications is twofold. First, AD is polygenic, so relevant disease driving mutations are spread thin across a multitude of different genes and patients. Second, current interpretations of the deleterious effects of mutations lack accuracy, so the impactful few cannot be distinguished from the benign multitude in any given subject. These problems compound and fog the statistical genetics of AD risk and morbidity with poor signal to noise ratio. The crux of our solution is to add a massive amount of new information, exploit it efficiently through computation, then perform rigorous multi-pronged experimental validation. We start from the hypothesis that AD arises through mutational perturbations that affect functional pathways beyond the built-in evolutionary tolerances. New algorithms compute these excessive mutational forces and place them in integrative machine learning frameworks to sort between AD patients and controls, and which can also reflect functional interactions among proteins or genes. Innovations include a mathematical model of evolution based on calculus; ensemble machine learning over human genome variations; and harmonic analysis of mutational perturbations in functional networks. The outcome will, for the first time, integrate genomic variations relevant to AD in the context of all relevant evolutionary history and all known functional interactions. In practice, this will increase power and resolution, enable gender-specific analysis and AD stratification of men and women, and identify new and experimentally validated AD genes. To carry out this program, AIM 1 will fuse a novel mathematical analysis of evolution with machine learning and network wavelet theory. This will yield complementary integrative approaches to identify genes and mutations that sort AD vs healthy subjects based on the abnormal mutational burden of rare gene variants in sequenced cohorts. AIM 2 will focus similar tools on patients and controls with known paradoxical phenotypes that run counter to their APOEɛ2/4 status. The results will identify modifier genes that drive AD in APOEɛ2 carriers or that protect APOEɛ4 carriers from AD. AIM 3 will provide direct experimental validation, leveraging high-throughput, robot-assisted genetic modifier screening in Drosophila models of Tau or amyloid-beta peptide neurotoxicity. Promising targets will be further confirmed in mammalian neuronal cell culture. The work will validate a new approach to enlarge our understanding of genetic complexity in Alzheimer’s Disease for the identification of gene drivers and modifiers to guide clinical assessment of AD risk stratification. Cognitive Computing of Alzheimer’s Disease Genes and Risk Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is devastating and its social and economic impact is projected to rise dramatically. Here, in order to discover genes that underlie its mechanisms and clinical risk, we fuse a new mathematical and machine learning framework with experimental testing in diverse models. The outcome will integrate vast amounts of data from evolution, from genome sequencing from experiments and from patients to guide clinical assessment of risk and open new paths for understanding the disease and for drug development.",Cognitive Computing of Alzheimer's Disease Genes and Risk,10219658,U01AG068214,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer associated neurodegeneration', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autopsy', 'Back', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Calculi', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Fogs', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoblotting', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Impacts', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive computing', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder control', 'drug development', 'economic impact', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'gene discovery', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic variation', 'human data', 'in vivo evaluation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning network', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'nerve stem cell', 'neuropathology', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'risk stratification', 'robot assistance', 'screening', 'social', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2021,799998
"Assessing Alzheimer disease risk and heterogeneity using multimodal machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia characterized by progressive loss of cognitive function. Unfortunately, currently there is no effective treatment for AD and clinical interventions of AD have largely failed despite enormous efforts. For the current application, we seek to develop multimodal machine learning models by leveraging the rich collection of AD-related omics data and phenotypical data recently generated from large-scale collaborative projects such as Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD (AMP-AD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). Three aims will be pursued in the current application. Aim 1. We will build an expandable multimodal unsupervised machine learning framework to investigate AD heterogeneity. Given the multifactorial nature of AD, we will perform AD subtyping by harnessing the rich information across multiple spectrum of data. Aim 2. We will build an expandable multimodal supervised machine learning framework to quantify AD risk from longitudinal follow up of cognitively normal elders. The models will be built from genetic susceptibility and gene regulatory information as well as endophenotypes measured when participants were cognitive normal. Aim 3. We will build AD-related gene interaction networks in post-mortem human brain samples. We will examine the association of multiple omics data with AD in brain samples, and build tissue-specific interaction networks to understand potential molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis. The present application represents an innovative approach to identify individuals at high risk of AD from both clinical and genetic risk factors in ethnically diverse populations. The outlined strategy will provide new insights into the risk stratification and prevention strategies for AD. We also commit to share our methods through GitHub or CRAN for free access across the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia but therapeutic clinical trials for AD have largely failed. The objective of our proposal is to develop and apply multimodal machine learning methods that can identify patterns and/or clusters with similar characteristics using extremely large amounts of data such as have been generated by the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and other large-scale collaborative projects.

"Uncoupling Age- Versus Cognitive-Related Cellular Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering, disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Effectual solutions will come only from innovative research. While aging is the biggest risk factor for developing AD, it is unclear to what extent normal aging is distinct from AD and which age-related factors drive disease. Senescence is a homeostatic response, which aims to prevent the propagation of these damaged cells while they remain viable and metabolically active. Senescent-like phenotypes have been described in neurons despite neurons being post-mitotic cells and these cells may release factors that trigger senescence in surrounding glia. Senescent glia and senescent-like neurons increase in the brain with age and are thought to contribute to the loss of function associated with aging and age-related diseases like AD. Our application, entitled “Uncoupling Age- Versus Cognitive-Related Cellular Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease,” is highly responsive to the objectives outlined in the RFA-AG-20-025, by leveraging an innovative molecular imaging platform we invented at Stanford; multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), in order to uncouple age- from cognitive decline-related cellular senescence. MIBI enables us to quantify, with low nanometer resolution, high-dimensional, protein-level expression patterns, single-cell (neuro/immune) interactions, and spatial localization of senescence- and AD- relevant molecules (Aim 1) in a model of healthy aging (Aim 2) and well-characterized cases of AD related cognitive impairment (Aim 3). Importantly, MIBI allows all of this to be accomplished in archival FFPE material, thus allowing retrospective analysis on a variety of existing cohorts. By creating in-depth, phenotypic cellular signatures with spatial context from our unique aging and cognitive cohorts, we will be able to provide insight for modifiable factors promoting cognitive decline by filtering those specifically associated with aging alone. In this research program, collaborative expertise in clinical neuropathology and cognitive decline, technological advancements in imaging, biochemical/molecular and cellular biology, and machine learning analytics converge in this proposed research program to address the spatio-cellular (neuro/immune, senescent) heterogeneity in non-human primate (NHP) and human models of healthy aging and AD brains. Furthermore, it will be synergistic to, and draw on expertise developed in existing infrastructure to image and organize AD clinical pathology (R01AG056287, R01AG057915, MPIs: SC Bendall, RM Angelo, TJ Montine) as well as the NIA-funded 90+ UCI cohort, control material housed in the Stanford ADRC, and NHP specimens (P50 AG047366 co-I: TJ Montine). We will reveal cellular senescent phenotypes that differentiate AD from normal age-associated senescence. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. By using multi- parametric measurements with enabling technologies like multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) we will be able to uncouple unhealthy brain senescence, that could be therapeutically targeted, from that associated with the normal aging process.",Uncoupling Age- Versus Cognitive-Related Cellular Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease,10222561,R01AG068279,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African Green Monkey', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cell Aging', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dendrites', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inferior', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Microglia', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Parietal', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Validation', 'abeta accumulation', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'brain tissue', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'collaborative approach', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'entorhinal cortex', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mind control', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'nanometer resolution', 'nanoscale', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuropathology', 'nonhuman primate', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'release factor', 'response', 'senescence', 'shared database', 'stressor', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic target', 'vervet']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,386256
"AMYLOIDOGENIC INDUCTION OF CELLULAR SENESCENCE IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular senescence, one of the major hallmarks of aging, describes the sudden inability for cells to divide. Senescent cells often accumulate with age, in response to physical and chemical stressors (genomic instability, telomere attrition, irradiation, etc.), though the overlap between these stressors and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is currently unknown. In-vitro experiments of senescence often utilize contrived stressors such as hydrogen peroxide or radiation, that may not be physiologically relevant for age-related diseases such as AD. Furthermore, the senescence phenotypes observed in vitro are likely not complete models for what is occurring in dynamic biological systems.  Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (Aβo), an important hallmark in AD, have been shown to potently induce senescence in a variety of brain cell types and environments, in contrast to fibrillar Ab. Aβo is thought to bind membrane proteins and subsequently signal downstream aggregation of related amyloids such as tau. In fact, the presence of endogenous Aβo is one of the strongest indicators of disease severity in AD models and organisms, suggesting a link between AD and cellular senescence that is only beginning to be explored.  In order to study this association, we propose to combine gold-standard techniques and single-cell omics data in order to define heterogenous genetic and epigenetic signatures of senescence that are distinctly a function of their induction type. Doing so will also produce robust signatures and biomarkers of senescence in brain cells that can be utilized for the pathological phenotyping of human tissues. These measures will also allow for the comparison of disparate senescent behaviors to help identify lab-derived amyloids that best resemble patient-derived constructs. We will evaluate multiple lab-derived Aβo constructs, including those stabilized from lipids located in predominantly diseased regions of the brain. Observations would be synergistically coupled with solution biophysics experiments and molecular modeling, providing analogous structural data for each inducer type. Taken together, these measurements will uniquely profile senescence in brain cells, define the degree of overlap between endogenous senescence inducers and those reconstituted in the lab, and highlighting how AD risk is modulated by cellular senescence. PROJECT NARRATIVE One of the most well-known hallmarks of human aging is cellular senescence; however the relationship between senescence and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is poorly understood. We hypothesize that soluble amyloids, but not fibrils or plaques, link the induction of cellular senescence in brain cells to neurodegeneration, yet it remains unclear which soluble amyloids modulate these behaviors. In order to test this hypothesis, we will utilize a combination of genetic and epigenetic measurements to compare the ability of synthetic and patient-derived amyloids to induce senescence in brain cells, thereby deducing the molecular and epigenetic overlap between senescence and AD.",AMYLOIDOGENIC INDUCTION OF CELLULAR SENESCENCE IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE,10222562,R01AG068285,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytes', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Aging', 'Cells', 'Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Coupled', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fibroblasts', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Instability', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Oncogene Activation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Radiation', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Solubility', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'abeta oligomer', 'age related', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker development', 'biophysical techniques', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'disorder control', 'experimental study', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'irradiation', 'molecular modeling', 'molecular phenotype', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'oligodendrocyte progenitor', 'reconstitution', 'response', 'senescence', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem cells', 'stressor', 'tau Proteins', 'telomere', 'therapeutic target']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,404248
"Generalizable Deep Learning Networks for Dual-tracer Amyloid/Tau PET/MRI Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and a major public health crisis, currently affecting over 5.8 million Americans and expected to rise as the population ages. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can identify the hallmark proteinopathies of AD, including amyloid protein plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (composed primarily of tau protein) accumulating in the brain. While there is evident need for more PET neuroimaging, for example, to elucidate the sequence of amyloid and tau deposition in preclinical AD, its increased utility in longitudinal imaging studies with large study populations is limited by recruitment and cost. In particular, making multiple visits to the scanning site will be difficult for participants living far away, and the high cost of injected radiotracers will limit the scalability of PET studies.  In this project we propose using deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau PET for imaging AD. Our specific aims are (1) to validate the diagnostic value of the CNNs in actual ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau imaging sessions, with the injected dose as low as 1% of the original, and with actual ultra-low-dose data, to validate simulations for use in subsequent aims and future studies; (2) to apply the ultra-low-dose CNN to data collected on other PET systems and tracers, in order to demonstrate the CNN’s generalizability; and (3) to evaluate the value of deep learning-aided ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau PET for tracking cognitive decline in a preclinical AD population.  The innovation of this work lies in using multimodal imaging in addition to advanced machine learning techniques to enable acquisition of diagnostic-level PET images at extremely low dose levels. Performing actual ultra-low-dose PET acquisitions is also highly novel in itself. The outcome of this proposal is removing the limiting factors to large-scale clinical longitudinal imaging, shortening acquisitions spanning multiple days and visits to several hours in one visit with a successive ultra-low-dose and full-dose dual-tracer scan protocol. Significant dose reduction can also be achieved, allowing for more frequent amyloid/tau PET scanning. This flexibility will not only increase the utility of PET, aid longitudinal studies in dementia, but enable future comprehensive imaging of multiple PET-based biomarkers as these tracers are being developed. Project Narrative  More frequent PET scans can be used for dementia, a major cause of deaths in the United States, to understand the pathogenesis of the brain proteinopathies involved, to identify at-risk individuals, and to provide outcome markers for clinical trials of anti-amyloid/tau therapies; but recruitment for studies, cost, and radiation dose to the scanned participant are critical factors limiting its use. This work aims to train versatile deep learning-based neural networks which can produce diagnostic-level images from ultra-low-dose (as low as 1%) amyloid and tau PET acquisitions. Our study will provide flexibility in recruitment (running ultra-low-dose and full-dose scans in succession for dual-tracer studies), reduce the cost for radiotracer use, and reduce the dose in scanned participants, a “win-win” for researchers and patients.",Generalizable Deep Learning Networks for Dual-tracer Amyloid/Tau PET/MRI Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease,10214874,K99AG068310,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Drowning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radioactivity', 'Reading', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'clinical application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'imaging agent', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'longitudinal positron emission tomography', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'radiotracer', 'recruit', 'research study', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'simulation', 'study population', 'tau Proteins', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,100863
"Circadian Organization and Disorder in Alzheimer's Disease ABSTRACT With an aging population, the impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on public health continues to explode. Altered daily rhythms in physiology and behavior are prominent features of AD. These altered activity rhythms are difficult to treat, disrupting the lives of both patients and caregivers. Mounting evidence suggests that these changes are more than just symptoms. Altered rhythms may contribute to AD progression and development. Many important transcripts, proteins, and metabolites oscillate with a daily cycle. Understanding these rhythms, and their influence on AD, offers the potential to identify new therapies. The translation of circadian biology to Alzheimer's care is limited. Which molecules and pathways show daily rhythms in our human brains? How do those rhythms change with AD? Do changes in molecular rhythms explain changing behavioral patterns? Can these rhythms be exploited for therapeutic benefit? To answer clinical questions, we need human data. AD brain banks provide an invaluable resource. But brain banks almost never provide the time of day when patients died, making it difficult to use these data for rhythms research. We developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure), a machine-learning tool to uncover molecular rhythms using unordered biopsy samples. Evaluating brain expression data, we showed that CYCLOPS could correctly reconstruct rhythms in brain samples and correctly predict the time of death. Here we will order cortical brain samples from control subjects and patients with AD. We will reconstruct the molecular rhythms in these human brains, identifying differences in AD patients and rhythms in known drug targets and AD disease pathways. We will analyze a subset of samples where time of death is known, comparing each subject's “internal molecular time” with the “time on the clock.” We will test the hypothesis that patients with poorly aligned molecular rhythms are more likely to have circadian behavioral disturbance. We will evaluate a measure of transcriptional rhythm strength, testing if “weaker” rhythms predict behavioral or molecular misalignment. Does AD alter rhythm generation? Does it desynchronize still rhythmic cells and brain regions? Using data from multiple brain regions sampled from the same subjects, we will evaluate intracortical circadian synchrony and compare AD patients with controls. Using single-nucleus sequencing data, we will explore the effect of AD on cell type specific rhythms and their synchrony. Finally, we will test the direct influence of important AD causing mutations on molecular clock function, measuring rhythms in isolated cells. This work will advance our understanding of circadian rhythms in AD pathology, clarify the relationship between behavioral and molecular circadian disruption, and catalyze opportunities for AD chronotherapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep and circadian disruption are prominent features of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. This work will help researchers understand how molecular rhythms in the brain may influence the progression of AD, contribute to the sleep disruption experienced by AD patients, and influence the time at which AD targeted medications will be most effective.",Circadian Organization and Disorder in Alzheimer's Disease,10220845,R01AG068577,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biology', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronotherapy', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Nuclear', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Update', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'cell type', 'circadian', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'metabolome', 'mind control', 'molecular clock', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein metabolite', 'relating to nervous system', 'risk variant', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,399859
"Reconstructing the temporal landscape of gene regulation in aging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The circadian rhythm orchestrates a vast repertoire of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes with a 24-hour period. A clock circuit, driven by the oscillatory activation and repression of a set of core clock genes, is present in every cell and regulates the expression of nearly half the genome across all tissues. Abundant epi- demiological evidence links circadian regulation to human health. In particular, sleep and circadian disruption is associated with neurodegeneration, where it is thought to be both a consequence and a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the most common form of dementia in the elderly, AD is rapidly becoming a public health cri- sis, affecting an estimated 5.5M people in the United States (24M world-wide) and is expected to double over the next 20 years. Addressing this crisis requires a deep understanding of disease mechanisms and the identiﬁcation of diagnostic/therapeutic targets. A wealth of existing transcriptomic data, coupled with the development of sophisticated computational tools for temporal reconstruction and analysis, provide an exciting opportunity to identify dysregulation in oscillatory patterns of gene expression associated with aging and AD.  We propose to develop novel computational strategies to decipher the oscillatory patterns of gene expression using existing untimed transcriptomic datasets; and to apply them to existing data from studies of AD to identify dysregulation in the oscillatory patterns associated with AD. Our methods address a number of analytical chal- lenges, including the need to reconstruct temporal information from untimed samples; ensuring generalizability and accuracy across different transcriptomic proﬁling technologies; addressing the fact that untimed samples may not span the full day; and identifying changes in complex, non-sinusoidal rhythms. Together, these studies will reveal oscillatory patterns of gene expression associated with aging and Alzheimers disease, and will provide innovative new methods for the circadian analysis of untimed data that can be applied to other phenotypes. NARRATIVE The circadian rhythm orchestrates critical physiological functions at the molecular, cell, and organismal levels. While degradation of the circadian rhythm is known to be associated with aging and believed to contribute to Alzheimer's and other age-related diseases, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly characterized. This project aims to develop and apply powerful computational tools to investigate circadian patterns of gene activity in older adults, with the goal of enabling personalized circadian medicine for an aging population.",Reconstructing the temporal landscape of gene regulation in aging,10261481,R01AG068579,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Noise', 'Older Population', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Repression', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Systems Theory', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'circadian', 'circadian regulation', 'computerized tools', 'disorder control', 'dynamic system', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'new technology', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'young adult']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,387178
"Learning the Regulatory Code of Alzheimer's Disease Genomes With ageing populations world-wide, neurodegenerative diseases are placing an ever increasing  burden on long- term well-being, healthcare costs and family life. Despite decades of research and  enormous investment, no disease-modifying treatment is available for the most common of these  diseases: Alzheimer’s (AD). The majority of these, to-date unsuccessful, efforts have focused   on one potential cause of AD: amyloid-β aggregation. Combining population-scale data  collection, human genetics and machine learning provides a way forward to uncover and characterize  new causal cellular processes involved in AD. This would provide an array of potential therapeutic  targets, increasing the chance that one will be more easily modulated than the amyloid-β pathway.  AD-specific genomic datasets of unprecedented scale are being actively collected: whole genome  sequencing (WGS) from ~20k individuals, gene expression (RNA-seq) and epigenomics (ATAC-seq,  histone ChIP-seq) from >1000 post-mortem AD brains, single-cell transcriptomes and similar modalities in peripheral and  brain-resident innate immune cells (which we and others have shown to be AD-relevant). Effectively  integrating these diverse data to better understand AD represents a substantial computational  challenge, both in terms of data scale and analysis complexity. This proposal leverages  state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML), combined with human genetic  analyses, to address this challenge. We will train DL models to predict epigenomic signals and  RNA splicing from genomic sequence, enabling in silico mutagenesis to estimate the  functional impact (a “delta score”) of any genetic variant. The delta scores will be used in  genetic analyses that distinguish causal associations: cellular changes that drive AD  pathogenesis rather than downstream/side effects of disease. Delta scores will aid in  associating both rare and common variants to AD. To achieve sufficient power, rare variants must be  aggregated (e.g. for a gene): delta scores will allow filtering out many likely non-functional  (particularly non-coding) variants. Most common variants from AD Genome Wide Association Studies  (GWAS) are simply correlated with the causal variant due to linkage disequilibrium (LD). Delta  scores, combined with trans-ethnic GWAS, will enable estimation of the likely causal variant(s).  These analyses will highlight variants and genes involved in AD. However, genes do not operate in a  vacuum so robust probabilistic ML will be used to learn cell-type and disease-specific gene  regulatory networks from sorted bulk and single-cell RNA-seq. The detected networks will be  integrated with our genetic findings to discover network neighborhoods/pathways especially  enriched in AD variants. Such pathways will be prime candidates for future functional and  therapeutic studies of AD. The goal of this research is to use machine learning algorithms to work out which  genetic differences in the genomes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients might have  caused their disease. We will do this by learning computational models of how genes are  controlled by genetic sequence and other genes. The proposed study will discover what genes,  pathways and molecular mechanisms are involved in AD, which will provide novel  therapeutic targets for AD patients.",Learning the Regulatory Code of Alzheimer's Disease Genomes,10247588,U01AG068880,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histones', 'Human Genetics', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vacuum', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abeta accumulation', 'base', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'diverse data', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'frontal lobe', 'functional genomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'in silico', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'mRNA Expression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'multi-ethnic', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protective allele', 'protein aggregation', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'side effect', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2021,1094724
"Improving the sensitivity and specificity of MRI-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease Finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one the greatest scientiﬁc challenges of our time. There is a growing realization that experimental treatments should target the earliest, presymptomatic stages of disease. But the cost of conducting clinical trials in participants who may not develop symptoms of AD for years can be prohibitive. There is a growing need for more eﬀective biomarkers of AD, particularly biomarkers of therapeutic eﬃcacy that can detect slowing or reversal of AD-related changes due to treatment as early in the clinical trial as possible. These biomarkers must be as sensitive as possible to disease progression and also account for AD heterogeneity, i.e., the fact that the majority of individuals who have AD pathology also have one or more concomitant pathologies that may aﬀect their ability to respond to experimental treatments for AD. This proposal focuses on deriving eﬀective presymptomatic and early symptomatic AD biomarkers from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the imaging modality that provides the most direct evidence of neuritic and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disease. Rather than propose new MRI acquisition protocols, we focus on the most commonly collected type of MRI scan in AD research (T1-weighted 3D gradient echo scans with approximately 1x1x1mm3 resolution) and use advanced computational analysis to quantify changes in the subregions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), the brain region that associated with early stages of AD pathology as well as with early stages of multiple concomitant non-AD pathologies. Aim 1 will develop and validate advanced algorithms that combine conventional multi-atlas segmentation with deep learning to reliably extract small subregions of the MTL, such as Brodmann area 35, explicitly accounting for anatomical variability in the MTL. Aim 2 will correlate quantitative digital pathology measures derived at autopsy with antemortem MRI to discover distinct patterns of change that we hypothesize are associated with concomitant pathologies in AD, including TDP-43 pathology, alpha-synucleinopathy, non-AD tauopathies, and cerebrovascular disease. Aim 3 will apply deep learning to improve the sensitivity of measures of change in longitudinal MRI, hypothetically leading to a more sensitive early marker of treatment eﬀectiveness in trials targeting preclinical AD than existing cognitive and imaging-based measures. Taken together, improved precision of segmentation (Aim 1), determination of spatial patterns of AD and concomitant non-AD pathology (Aim 2), and advanced longitudinal measurement methodology (Aim 3) will optimize MTL subregional sensitivity and speciﬁcity for the earliest neurodegenerative changes of AD, providing a potentially critical therapeutic eﬃcacy measure to accelerate clinical trials of disease modifying treatments in early AD. Treatments for Alzheimer's disease will likely be most eﬀective if applied before patients begin to develop symptoms of cognitive decline. But clinical trials in individuals who do not yet have any symptoms of disease can take a very long time and be very costly. This project uses common magnetic resonance imaging exams and artiﬁcial intelligence tools to detect subtle changes over time in parts of the brain where damage speciﬁcally due to Alzheimer's disease ﬁrst occurs, providing clinical trials with a faster way to determine if treatments are being eﬀective.",Improving the sensitivity and specificity of MRI-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease,10235472,RF1AG069474,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer associated neurodegeneration', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Brodmann&apos', 's area', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Placebos', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'computational atlas', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'digital pathology', 'disease heterogeneity', 'empowered', 'experimental arm', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'phase III trial', 'pre-clinical', 'protein TDP-43', 'recruit', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'synucleinopathy', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,RF1,2021,2094490
"Deep Learning with Neuroimaging Genetic Data for Alzheimer's Disease Summary  Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects over 44 million individuals worldwide, and the number is projected to triple by 2050. However, currently there is no cure for AD. This project aims to develop and apply novel statistical methods, especially deep learning, to advance neuroimaging genetics for AD. It involves novel methodological developments in Aims 1-4, cost-effective applications to the large-scale UK Biobank neuroimaging genetic data for AD (Aim 5), and software development (Aim 6). All four Aims for the methods development tackle emerging impor- tant topics in deep learning with their applications to neuroimaging genetics for AD; although the other three Aims deal with independent topics with their own other broad applications, they in turn serve for Aim 1: 1) Aim 1 applies manually searched deep learning models for automatic feature extraction/phenotyping from neuroimages, by which both the statistical power and biological interpretation of subsequent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are expected to be enhanced; 2) Aim 2 employs (automatic) neural architecture search (NAS) to more efﬁciently identify better deep learning models, which are then applied to Aim 1 for enhancing feature extraction/phenotyping and thus boosting the power of GWAS; 3) Aim 3 focuses on explainable deep learning, offering biological insights by localizing and highlighting the most important features extracted by deep learning models that can be used for Aim 1; 4) Aim 4 develops a novel inferential theory for deep learning, which is then applied to rigorously test for the statistical signiﬁcance of any selected/highlighted features used in Aim 1. In Aim 5, these new methods will be applied to the UK Biobank neuroimaging and GWAS data to identify novel genetic loci and neuroimaging features for AD. As a byproduct, we will develop and distribute software implementing the proposed methods in Aim 6. Project Narrative  This proposed research is to develop new statistical estimation and inference methods for deep learning with their applications to neuroimaging genetics for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is expected to contribute to the elucidation of genetic components and etiology of AD with potential applications to other common diseases, thus facilitating their prevention, early diagnosis and therapeutic development.",Deep Learning with Neuroimaging Genetic Data for Alzheimer's Disease,10267714,R01AG069895,"['Advocate', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Domains', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'biobank', 'combinatorial', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'endophenotype', 'feature extraction', 'feature selection', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'method development', 'model building', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'trait', 'web site']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,667791
"Drug repositioning for Alzheimer's disease via genetics, electronic health records, and human iPSC models Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of  dementia in the United States. Unfortunately, there is no cure for AD. Drug discovery for AD has  suffered significant failures, many at late stage clinical trials, partly due to our poor  understanding of AD pathology and the lack of disease-relevant and human-relevant discovery and  development models. This calls for team efforts with diverse and complementary expertise to tackle  the challenges together, by developing innovative approaches from multiple angles to achieve the  goal of identifying AD drugs.  In this application, we propose three complementary  Specific Aims that together aim to identify  FDA approved drugs with repurpose potential for AD, from distinct but complementary angles that act  synergistically to boost the likelihood of success. AD is a highly heritable disease, with an  estimated heritability of 70%, highlighting the critical role of genetics in understanding  the  disease etiology. Recent genetic studies have identified over 30 loci, enabling us to dissect the  genetic architecture of AD, including the biological processes and cell types involved in disease  etiology. In particular, we aim to dissect the highly polygenic AD etiology into distinct  pathophysiological components to guide drug repurposing,  which is only feasible in recent years  thanks to large scale GWAS and massive genomics data available publicly (Aim 1). In parallel, we  will mine millions of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify drugs that reduce AD risk and  cognitive decline, by developing phenotyping algorithms from EHR for AD related phenotypes (Aim 2).  In addition, we will develop a high­ throughput screening (HTS) gene expression profiling assay and  use human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models to identify candidate compounds, and will  further test the efficacy of the candidates in both patient-derived iPSC lines and AD mouse models  (Aim 3). The three aims are complementary  and synergistic, in the sense that they independently   tackle the same problem from drastically distinct angles, while findings from one can be served as  validation for others. Altogether, leveraging distinct and complementary  expertise, we expect to  yield bona fide repurposable drugs for AD with orthogonal support.

"TargetAD: A systems multi-omics approach to drug repositioning in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a slowly progressing, untreatable neurodegenerative disorder that affects a substantial fraction of the aging population today. Hundreds of clinical trials and massive investments into drug development efforts have so far not resulted in a single disease-modifying therapy that showed a significant beneficial effect on the disease. Drug repositioning, the application of approved drugs in a novel disease context, has gained increasing attention as a promising alternative to identify treatment options for AD. For successful pharmaceutical intervention in AD, a drug or drug combination needs to target the complex molecular changes observed in AD in a specific manner. To identify drugs exerting these desired effects a detailed understanding of the molecular networks across regulatory layers that underly the biological system is required. However, these networks are not readily available and are scattered across hundreds of studies and complex databases. To address this challenge, we propose TargetAD, a network-based framework that builds this molecular network from genetic associations, co-expression/correlation networks, metabolic pathways, gene regulation data, protein-protein interactions, and tissue-specific gene and protein expression data augmented with AD multi-omics associations, as well as drug-drug target data and molecular drug signatures. We will achieve this by leveraging the power of large-scale, multi-omics association results generated within NIH's large “Accelerating Medicines Partnership - Alzheimer's Disease” initiative and other large-scale population-based studies. The collective evidence will be stored in a publicly accessible graph database, which we then use for the identification of candidate drugs or drug combinations (“candidates”). Through the development of a novel network-based machine-learning method, we will rank candidates in the database by their probability to affect AD networks in a beneficial way. High-ranking candidates will be subjected to a comprehensive prioritization pipeline. To this end, we will retrospectively investigate whether longitudinal AD-related biomarker profiles of individuals who took a repositioning candidate show evidence for healthier aging in large studies of AD. These analyses will be complemented by examining whether the post- mortem neuropathological burden supports a beneficial effect of the candidate. To increase power and coverage of candidates, we will further analyze electronic health records from the UK Biobank for additional evidence. The three most promising candidates will be selected in discussion with a panel of experts. These will be evaluated by preclinical validation studies in animal models of AD. In summary, the unique combination of multidisciplinary expertise, access to high-profile datasets and advanced computational integration pipelines will allow us to identify molecular pathways disturbed in AD that are targetable by drug repositioning candidates, which thus are prime candidates for testing in clinical trials. Project Narrative Drug repositioning - the application of approved drugs in a novel disease context - has gained increasing attention as a way to identify alternative treatment strategies for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We here propose a novel machine-learning approach to identify drug repositioning candidates in a network-based framework by combining multi-omics associations from large studies of AD with molecular pathway information, extensive drug-drug target data, as well as molecular drug effect data. In silico repositioning candidates will be further prioritized through retrospective analyses in studies of AD and large-scale mining of electronic health records, and the resulting top three candidates will be experimentally validated in mouse models of AD.",TargetAD: A systems multi-omics approach to drug repositioning in Alzheimer's disease,10299231,R01AG069901,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Animal Model', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Graph', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population Study', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Route', 'Scoring Method', 'Screening Result', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'aged', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'amyloid pathology', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological systems', 'candidate identification', 'clinical biomarkers', 'data mining', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'endophenotype', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'protein expression', 'protein protein interaction', 'religious order study', 'standardize measure', 'study population', 'synaptic function', 'tau Proteins', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,624944
"Genetic and molecular correlates of white matter pathology in Alzheimers disease PROJECT SUMMARY: Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is typically defined by the accumulation of beta- amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, synaptic loss and neuronal degeneration, the disease is not restricted to the gray matter. Neuroimaging and neuropathological studies have documented a significant loss of white matter in AD, which begins early in the disease course and is correlated with cognitive decline. In addition to contributions of hypoperfusion-related ischemic injury and neurodegeneration-associated axonal loss, emerging evidence indicates a decline and dysfunction of oligodendrocyte populations as additional factors in this multifactorial white matter disease process. Oligodendrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type in the brain, but are the least studied cell population in the context of neurodegeneration despite their vital role for myelin maintenance and neuronal support. With the increasing recognition of the role of myelin in AD, it becomes important to understand the genetic and molecular factors that link oligodendrocytes to the AD process. Our knowledge about genetic variants contributing to overall AD risk and influencing AD-associated endophenotypes is accelerating. Our proposal is designed to bring these two lines of investigation together and begin to explore genetic modifiers of oligodendrocyte and myelin abnormalities in AD and underlying molecular mechanisms using a quantitative trait approach of neuropathologically defined myelin endophenotypes.  The central hypothesis of our proposal is that loss of myelin integrity and oligodendrocyte dysfunction in AD are associated with genetic variants and molecular changes. We will test this hypothesis by first performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of white and gray matter neuropathological endophenotypes in human postmortem brain tissue samples and will then conduct bulk and spatially defined gene expression studies to explore underlying molecular mechanisms. Our experiments are divided into two specific aims: Aim 1) To determine genetic modifiers of myelin and oligodendrocyte pathologies in AD. Aim 2) To determine associations between white matter gene expression changes and white matter pathologies in AD.  The above aims benefit from the tight integration and leveraging of a diverse group of investigators with expertise in the neuropathology of AD and digitally quantified pathology endophenotypes (PI Kofler), AD- associated oligodendrocyte pathology (Co-I Herrup), GWAS data analysis (Co-Is Kamboh and Fan), biostatistical analysis of transcriptomics datasets (Co-I Ding) and digital image analysis and machine learning (Co-I Pearce). Upon completion of our proposed studies, we will have identified novel candidate genes as mediators of myelin pathology in AD, increased our understanding about the biology underlying their linkage to AD and revealed novel targets for therapeutic interventions. As our study design includes separate analyses of gray and white matter regions and stratification by sex, we will have further delineated regional and sex- specific differences in myelin and oligodendrocyte pathobiology in the context of AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Alzheimer's disease is not restricted to the gray matter regions of the brain but also affects the white matter, and these changes contribute to cognitive decline. We propose to evaluate the contributions of genetic variants to the development of oligodendrocyte dysfunction and myelin integrity loss in Alzheimer’s disease using postmortem human tissue samples. We will then conduct gene expression studies to identify underlying molecular mechanisms.",Genetic and molecular correlates of white matter pathology in Alzheimers disease,10093220,R01AG069912,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Astrocytes', 'Attention', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Complement', 'DNA Damage', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Molecular', 'Myelin', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Optics', 'Pallor', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'SNP array', 'Sex Differences', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue Sample', 'White Matter Disease', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'abeta accumulation', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'cell population study', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'endophenotype', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'gray matter', 'human tissue', 'hyperphosphorylated tau', 'hypoperfusion', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'interest', 'ischemic injury', 'nano-string', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'protein aggregation', 'regional difference', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'white matter', 'white matter change', 'whole slide imaging']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,521155
"Genetics of deep-learning-derived neuroimaging endophenotypes for Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive impairment of cognitive and memory functions and is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. It affects 5.6 million Americans over the age of 65 and exacts tremendous and increasing demands on patients, caregivers, and healthcare resources, making this condition among the most significant public health problems of our time. Despite extensive studies, our understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of AD is still limited, hindering advances in the development of therapeutic and preventive strategies. Genetic studies of AD have successfully identified 40 novel loci but these explain only a fraction of the overall disease risk, suggesting opportunities for additional discoveries. Advanced neuroimaging is an essential part of current AD clinical and research investigations, which generally focus on relatively few imaging phenotypes developed by neuro- radiologists. However, there is a growing interest in exploiting the high-content information in large-scale, high dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to identify novel AD biomarkers. Deep learning (DL) methods, an emerging area of machine learning research, uses raw images to derive optimal vector representations of imaging contents, which can be used as informative AD endophenotypes. To overcome the low interpretability traditionally attributed to DL, whole genome sequence data provide an opportunity to identify novel genes underlying the DL- derived imaging endophenotypes and test their association with AD and AD-related traits in large cohort samples. The proposed project will leverage existing neuroimaging and genetic data resources from the UK Biobank, the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, and will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team of investigators. We will derive AD endophenotypes from neuroimaging data in the UK Biobank using deep learning (DL). We will identify novel genetic loci associated with DL-derived imaging endophenotypes and optimize the co-heritability of these endophenotypes with AD-related phenotypes using UK Biobank genetic data. We will leverage resources and collaborations with AD Consortia and the power of DL-derived neuroimaging endophenotypes to identify novel genes for Alzheimer's Disease and AD-related traits. Also, we will develop DL-based neuroimaging harmonization and imputation methods and distribute implementation software to the research community. We expect to discover new genes relevant to AD which may leads to understanding of molecular basis of AD and potential new treatment. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is sever neurodegenerative disease affecting aging Americans and exacts tremendous and increasing demands on patients, caregivers, and healthcare resources.

"Brain entropy mapping in Alzheimer's Disease ABSTRACT. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has affected tens of millions of people but remains incurable. The major risk factor for AD is aging, which entails high brain entropy due to the progressive brain damages. Notably, the brain constantly consumes a large amount of energy to maintain its functional integrity, likely creating a big “reserve” to counteract the high entropy. Malfunctions of this reserve may indicate a critical point of disease conversion and progression. Reserve malfunction can be measured by the compensation outcome: functional brain entropy (fBEN), which may reveal critical information for bridging the knowledge gap between AD pathology and clinical symptoms: AD pathology begins long before AD symptoms and may not lead to dementia, and may provide a brain marker for early disease detection. This project is proposed to characterize fBEN in normal aging and the AD continuum and test an inverse U-shape fBEN model: fBEN increases with age and AD pathology in normal aging but decreases in the AD continuum. We will test the model using large existing resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data. Our group started rsfMRI-based fBEN mapping in 2010 and released the first open-source fBEN mapping tool. The tool has been widely used in many neuroscientific and translational studies. To be scalable for large data, we will develop a further accelerated version in this project. In Aim 1, we will calculate fBEN using data from 2000+ young and old healthy individuals from public databases and examine the associations of fBEN to age, education, and cognitive function. We hypothesize that the brain has a reserve-related network whose fBEN decreases with years of education and is negatively correlated with brain function, suggesting low fBEN in this network as an indicator of brain reserve. Aim 2 will characterize fBEN in AD and assess its associations to AD pathology and clinical symptoms. We hypothesize that there is a strong pathology vs disease interaction on fBEN: fBEN increases with age and pathology in normal aging and lower fBEN correlates with better cognition; those associations will be reversed in the AD continuum so that fBEN will decrease with pathology level and lower fBEN will correlate to worse cognition. Aim 3 will evaluate the feasibility of baseline fBEN in regions elucidated in Aims 1 and 2 for early disease detection. Because fBEN may only reflect some part of the functional abnormalities in AD, we will combine fBEN with other imaging biomarkers in the model in order to achieve higher prediction accuracy. We will also build a model to use fBEN to predict AD pathology in normal aging. The clinical impact of this project includes: 1) testing the hypothetical fBEN model will help delineate the pathology vs clinical discrepancy in AD; 2) finding the disease related fBEN patterns may provide a potential intervention target; 3) testing the prediction model will aid early disease detection; 4) AD pathology prediction is of great clinical value for normal aging and AD management as current AD pathology measurement is either painful or too expensive. The feasibility of this novel project and the many new hypotheses have been initially demonstrated by our extensive preliminary data. Alzheimer’s Disease is a currently incurable brain disease. Brain entropy is an important trait of brain function and may provide critical information for unveiling neuromechanisms of complex disorders like AD. Using large existing data, this project will examine brain entropy change in AD and to assess brain entropy as a potential biomarker for AD. Given our aging population and the increasing prevalence of AD, performing this project is likely to have significant public health impact.",Brain entropy mapping in Alzheimer's Disease,10306016,R01AG070227,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Entropy', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Normal Range', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Symptoms', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'glucose metabolism', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'open source', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'sex', 'support vector machine', 'tau Proteins', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational study', 'uptake']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,588793
"Characterization of Alternative Polyadenylation in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly progressive brain disorder characterized by cognitive decline, irreversible memory loss, disorientation, and language impairment. Recent advances in genomic technologies and the explosive genomic information related to disease have accelerated the convergence of discovery science with clinical medicine. We aim to utilize cutting-edge techniques in computational biology, RNA biology, and systems biology to identify novel prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers and to develop innovative therapeutic strategies for AD. We will establish a comprehensive archive of human polyadenylation sites by combining various APA databases. We will train a reliable deep neural network (DNN) model by considering both cis ad trans factors, and then apply this DNN prediction model to characterize APA events in AD samples across several AD consortia (Aim 1.1). We will develop highly efficient and accurate approaches based on deep learning to identify apaQTLs in order to maximize the utility of genotyping data to understand the functional effects of genetic variants in AD. We will perform integrative analysis with multi-omics data generated by other projects to understand the regulatory network, aiming to provide additional evidence for functional interpretation of apaQTLs in AD (Aim 1.2). We will perform integrative analysis with our established rigorous computational approaches to identify APA events associated with AD traits, in order to identify novel prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for AD (Aim 2.1). To facilitate the utilization of large-scale data by the broad biomedical community, we will develop a comprehensive data resource to provide a computational framework that enables user-friendly interactive exploration and visualization of the biomedical significance of APA events (Aim 2.2). We expect to build a critical foundation to demonstrate that APA events represent novel types of biomarkers and serve as promising therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes. Our proposed research could pave the innovative way for aiding precision medicine because we will develop highly innovative computational framework based on deep learning to identify APA events and perform apaQTL analysis to identify a novel class of APA-based biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The proposed research is of high significance because it will fundamentally advance our knowledge about the molecular basis of AD and contribute to a broader understanding of the overall complexity of AD.

"Digital Biomarkers for Alzheimers Disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by progressive neuropathological changes that begin decades before cognitive and functional symptoms, and thus efforts have been focused on developing innovative tools and biomarkers for early identification of pre-dementia stages. To date, clinical ability to identify those with pre-dementia stages of AD has been limited and requires expensive (Amyloid PET) or invasive (Lumbar Punctures, LP) testing. However, subtle changes in connected speech may be detectable years before overt disease symptoms present.

We plan to extend this cohort of 400 participants for 3 more years to collect additional waves of voice recordings, cognitive assessments, and follow-up CSF biomarkers and neuroimaging. Our overarching hypothesis is that the derived novel features reflecting poor lexical-semantic connectedness or acoustic perturbations are significantly different between biomarker positive and negative participants, have better diagnostic performance than traditional cognitive tests (e.g. confrontation naming), and are associated with a longitudinal change in cognition and AD-related biomarkers. The Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the accuracy of the derived digital biomarkers in detection of in-vivo AD pathology in the B-SHARP cohort; 2) Investigate longitudinally the association of the derived features with cognitive decline and their ability to reflect changes in AD biomarkers; and 3) using resting state functional MRI, identify the networks in the brain that map to derived lexical semantic and acoustic features with brain connectivity at baseline and during follow-up.

"Social spatial navigation assessment for early-stage Alzheimer's disease Project Summary  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a public health epidemic, laying an enormous mental, physical, and financial burden on individuals, families, and societies. Despite significant research efforts around the world, the specific link between cognitive / functional deficits and the underlying pathology remains unclear. Critical to solving this is the evaluation of novel cognitive tests within cohorts that have detailed biomarkers for AD pathophysiology. Widely used cognitive tests for AD focus on episodic memory deficits, but recent work led by us and others indicates that tests of spatial navigation and orientation may provide significantly more accurate detection of the earliest signatures of AD. Our hypothesis is that integrating tests of navigation and orientation (to people, places, and events) into one test will prove particularly sensitive. Currently no such test exists.  Our aim is to develop and evaluate a novel ecologically valid cognitive test which probes both navigation and orientation in order to assess cognitively normal older adults (CN), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild AD dementia participants from two ongoing imaging studies (R01 AG053184 and R01 AG067021) of the Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Gad Marshall. Participants will undergo amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) as part of those studies, which we will leverage in relating those biomarker findings to our novel cognitive test across the early AD continuum. Creating the new test will require combining the expertise of Co-PI Dr. Hugo Spiers (expert in spatial navigation) and Co-PI Dr. Shahar Arzy (expert in orientation). Dr. Spiers has recently developed a virtual reality (VR)-based assessment tool for smartphone and tablet devices that has tested 4.3 million participants on their navigation ability. While this enables an unparalleled opportunity for machine learning to detect subtle impairments, the task is not tailored to the individual’s personal world, which clinical experience as well as research from the Co-PI, Dr. Arzy, indicate to be critical in AD. We therefore propose to develop a novel patient-tailored digital personalized tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of early- stage AD. Building on our recent work, Google Street View (GSV) images will be used to display and enable navigation of the participant’s familiar environment. Overlaid text messages will pop up to provide information about the overriding cover-story and to test navigation and orientation. We will benchmark how hard each person’s environment is to navigate using reinforcement learning (RL) agents trained on the local street networks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to understand the brain networks engaged by the new task and allow a comparison with the pathological and clinical data collected by Dr. Marshall. Machine learning models will be used to detect subtle impairment in the individual participant level. Following Dr. Spiers’ success in mass appeal and the access to advanced machine learning analyses, the project will enable precision personalized diagnostics of people at the earliest symptomatic stages of AD, and later on, a digital tool to conveniently follow patients over time. Project Narrative  The development of a new digital diagnostic test for the assessment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that is ecologically valid is of great importance. In the process, we will gain a new understanding of how people orient and navigate in familiar places and social networks and obtain a more detailed understanding of the changes in the brain that take place in AD in relation to the main problems that occur early in the disease. Finally, new insights into the brain dynamics involved in navigating space and social networks will be gained.",Social spatial navigation assessment for early-stage Alzheimer's disease,10126352,R21AG070877,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease test', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory impairment', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neighborhoods', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Space Perception', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Work', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'digital', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peer', 'personalized diagnostics', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'social', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality', 'way finding', 'young adult', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,190054
"Gene Profile Analysis of Associations between Alzheimer’s Disease and Circadian Rhythmic Patterns of Human Brain Regions Using Machine Learning Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading form of dementia, and it has an increasing death rate throughout the world. It gradually damages a patient’s memory, speech, thinking, and ability to perform routine activities. While a few drugs may temporarily relieve some mild early AD symptoms, they cannot stop or reverse cognitive and memory impairment. Multiple studies have shown that circadian rhythm and AD have a close, intricate, bidirectional relationship. Accumulating evidence indicates that the disorder of circadian rhythm is not only a pathological marker but a putative risk factor of AD. Improved understanding of the relationship between AD and the circadian rhythm has the potential to guide the development of effective AD interventions or treatment. Timed gene expression data human brains are rare because of its highly invasive nature. In general, brain gene expression studies in neurodegeneration are based on post-mortem tissue samples with no or inaccurate, if any, time labels. Currently, there is a pending need for characterizing molecular mechanisms which underlie the relationship of AD with human brain circadian rhythms. However, effective methods are yet to be developed to analyze whole-genome gene expression data with none or inaccurate time labels to discover AD-specific differentiated circadian rhythmic patterns. Toward filling this urgent unmet need, our overall aim is to develop innovative algorithms to discover circadian oscillation patterns based on genome-wide gene profile analysis, and leverage them to identify and understand the associations of AD with circadian rhythms of different brain regions. This project will bridge a critical methodological gap to enable innovative discovery from untimed high- dimensional human brain data. It has a great potential to advance the understanding of the impact of circadian rhythm on AD, and also provide researchers with a host of potential therapeutic targets for AD, e.g., rhythmic synchronization of brain regions, to guide the development of future interventions. This project is highly innovative. For the first time, gene profile analysis based on untimed expression data of tens of thousands of genes will be performed to pinpoint the AD-specific differentiated rhythmic patterns of different brain regions. To our knowledge, this is the only capacity of its kind, which permits the most direct glimpse into the circadian events in the human brain at the brain region- or tissue-level. The algorithms will be used to find oscillation patterns and rhythmic correlations between brain regions for cohorts with or without AD and unique subsets of AD patients. Because a clear understanding between AD and the disturbances of human brain circadian rhythms is elusive, deciphering oscillation patterns of brain regions and accounting for patient heterogeneity should advance our understanding of the complexity of AD and its intricate relationship with circadian rhythms of regions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This R21 study is a retrospective study, and we will conduct genome-wide analyses of secondary untimed gene expression data in existing large-scale databases of randomized cohorts for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The goal is to discover circadian oscillation patterns and using them to pinpoint associations of AD with circadian rhythms of human brain regions to guide future development of interventions.",Gene Profile Analysis of Associations between Alzheimer’s Disease and Circadian Rhythmic Patterns of Human Brain Regions Using Machine Learning,10126568,R21AG070909,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Circadian Rhythm Disorder', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Dementia', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Randomized', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sample Size', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'circadian', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'gene expression database', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large-scale database', 'patient subsets', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'whole genome']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R21,2021,420750
"Diagnosing the undiagnosable: studies of Alzheimer disease mimics and confounders via ""neuropathometry"" of dissection photos with 3D scanning Project Summary Title: Diagnosing the undiagnosable: studies of Alzheimer disease mimics and confounders via ""neuropathometry"" of dissection photos with 3D scanning Summary: While most patients with late life dementia have Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there are conditions that overlap or even mimic AD, confounding clinical diagnosis, and thus representing a barrier to accurate predictions of rate of progression and to effective therapeutics. Examples of these diseases include concomitant TDP-43 pathology, Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and microvascular lesions associated with poorly defined white matter lesions. A critical barrier to studying these diseases is that there currently is no reliable premortem biomarker. Here we propose a collaboration with two Alzheimer’s Research Centers to evaluate anatomical signatures of these three conditions, in contrast to AD, in order to enable research into them, and ultimately port back to MRI in order to directly enhance clinical care.  Specifically, we propose to use advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to perform volumetric photographic scanning post mortem (at autopsy), on patients seen at the Massachusetts Alzheimer Disease Research Center (MADRC). Reconstructing imaging volumes from dissection photographs, which are routinely acquired at brain banks and neuropathology departments, will enable us to correlate neuropathology with macroscopic measurements (e.g., volume and shape of brain structures, cortical thickness) without the need for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. This is crucial because diagnostic MRI is not always acquired close to autopsy, or at all, and ex vivo MRI is expensive, technically challenging, and not available at many research sites. Therefore, our technique has the potential of greatly increasing sample sizes, especially with asymptomatic individuals who were not scanned in life, and who would likely manifest the earliest and purest neuropathological changes.  Our tools will combine ML with 3D shape scanning, which is an increasingly inexpensive technology ($1,000 - $10,000 for a scanner), to produce very accurate reconstructions of the brain shape. Moreover, we will also build an “atlas” version of the tool, that replaces 3D scanning by a probabilistic atlas, thus enabling analysis of retrospective data. We will develop the tools in collaboration with a second ADRC, the University of Washington ADRC, which has slice photographs for approximately one thousand cases.  The new tools will be used to closely study a prospective cohort at MADRC, consisting of 200 subjects. We seek to identify neuroimaging signatures of the AD mimics mentioned above, which can be ported to in vivo MRI scanning. Moreover, we will also distribute and maintain the tools as part of our neuroimaging package FreeSurfer (over 40,000 worldwide licenses), so they can be used by research sites around the world to augment neuropathology with macroscopic morphometric measures at little or no cost. Project Narrative There are conditions that overlap or even mimic Alzheimer’s disease, confounding clinical diagnosis, and thus representing a barrier to effective treatment. Here we propose a collaboration with two NIH Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers to build advanced Artificial Intelligence tools that, combined with a 3D shape scanner, convert dissection photographs (routinely acquired by research centers) into 3D datasets. We will use these tools to unravel the connection between brain shape and microscopic diagnosis of AD mimics, and will also distribute them as part of our widespread software package FreeSurfer (over 40,000 worldwide licenses), so they can be freely used by research laboratories around the world.","Diagnosing the undiagnosable: studies of Alzheimer disease mimics and confounders via ""neuropathometry"" of dissection photos with 3D scanning",10125271,R01AG070988,"['3-Dimensional', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Back', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Dementia with Lewy Bodies', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Photography', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Senile Plaques', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'design', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'heterogenous data', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in-vivo diagnostics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'object shape', 'open source', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,502096
"Delaying Alzheimer's Disease Progression Through Intranasally Administered Nano-Antioxidants Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the neuropathological accumulation of amyloid beta (Ab) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau. Recent data from multiple groups support that given enough time, Ab and tau spreads throughout the brain in a well-defined manner along brain networks, very similar to the way a prion protein travels throughout the brain. Notably, the olfactory system has been reported to be one of the first systems affected in AD. Our past work has focused on using Manganese Enhanced MRI (MEMRI) to assess axonal transport in the olfactory system in mouse models of AD. Indeed, we have reported that axonal transport deficits in the olfactory system are detectable prior to the development of learning and memory deficits and well before plaque formation. These data are consistent with the idea that AD pathology spreads throughout the brain, beginning with the olfactory system. Additionally, our prior work has also focused on the effects of reducing oxidative stress in mouse models of AD. When we reduced oxidative stress by overexpressing superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD-2) in mouse models of AD, we observed a complete recovery in learning and memory deficits, a complete recovery in axonal transport deficits in the olfactory system as well as an over 50% reduction in Ab plaque formation. Although oxidative stress has been identified as a significant player in the development of AD, efforts to reduce oxidative stress with antioxidants has met with limited success. Some of the reasons for this are thought to include the inability to target sufficient quantities of administered antioxidants to the appropriate regions within the brain. Additionally, clinically available antioxidants have poor solubility and do not readily enter cells. Thus, we have turned to nanotechnology and have been working with nano-antioxidants that are much more potent than clinically available antioxidants, are non-toxic and readily enter cells. We therefore hypothesize that protecting olfactory and adjoining structures with intranasally administered nano-antioxidants (PEG-HCCs) will slow down the progression of AD as assessed with behavioral assays, MEMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) as well as 31P measurements and histology. We will also incorporate machine learning, specifically, a probabilistic graphical model, to determine the interactions of the readouts in Aims 1 and 2 in mouse models of AD and controls with and without treatment with PEG-HCCs. We also propose to incorporate machine learning to predict 1) the degree to which superoxide levels should be reduced to improve AD pathology and 2) which stages of AD (e.g. pre vs post plaque) are beyond rescue. Completion of this highly innovative project will have significant impact towards future AD therapeutic strategies. The proposed research is relevant to public health because we are conducting research that will advance our understanding of network spread that occurs in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) leading from the olfactory system but also the roles of oxidative stress in AD. As a result, the proposed work is relevant to the component of NIH’s mission of developing novel and innovative methods such as machine learning to understand and potentially treat AD, a disease that is on the rise and has significant health consequences.",Delaying Alzheimer's Disease Progression Through Intranasally Administered Nano-Antioxidants,10395142,R56AG071152,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Axonal Transport', 'Bayesian Network', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Intranasal Administration', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manganese', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Phosphocreatine', 'PrP', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'SOD2 gene', 'Senile Plaques', 'Solubility', 'Structure', 'Superoxides', 'Support Groups', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abeta accumulation', 'awake', 'behavior influence', 'disorder control', 'hyperphosphorylated tau', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mouse model', 'nano', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'sensory system', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'time use']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R56,2021,730015
"CRCNS: Investigating Brain Dynamics through the Lens of Statistical Mechanics Synaptic dysfunction has been hypothesized to be one of the earliest brain changes in Alzheimer’s  disease (AD), leading to hyper-excitation in neuronal circuits. However, network changes related to age  and sex tend to overlap with disease neuropathology, increasing the difficulty of separating  disease-specific alterations from those related to normal aging trajectories in males and females. Indeed,  AD disproportionately affects women, who comprise two thirds of all persons diagnosed with AD dementia.  Leveraging resting state fMRI connectome and diffusion MRI-derived structural connectome, we will use a  novel hybrid resting-state structural connectome (rs-SC) to study excitation-inhibition balance. Recently,  using a group of cognitively normal APOE-ε4 carriers and age/gender matched non-carriers we  demonstrated a sex-by-age-by-phenotype interaction, with significant hyperexcitation with increasing age  only observable in women, but not in men. Further, hyperexcitation in female carriers began to exhibit at  age 50 in the anterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus and temporal lobe regions, and the degree of  hyperexcitation is linked to compensatory recruitment of neuronal resources during a spatial learning  memory task.  In this proposal, we will characterize 1) sex-specific normative trajectories of excitation-inhibition balance  using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data, and 2) altered excitation-inhibition balance in  abnormal aging using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, as well as 3) further  test and validate our hyperexcitation framework in longitudinal mouse models of AD. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  In this proposal, we will develop novel computational tools to characterize hyper-excitation patterns in  aging and Alzheimer's Disease and validate our hyperexcitation framework on human data (ADNI and  HCP) as well as longitudinal mouse models of AD.

"Microglia models for Alzheimer's disease drug screening PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disease marked by a progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions, resulting in profound dementia. AD is the most common late-onset dementia affecting millions of people in the developed countries of the world and the AD population predicted to reach 130 million by 2050. There has been a concerted effort to identify the mechanism of disease, development of models and therapeutics. In AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, the observations of uncontrolled chronic inflammatory pathology in the CNS and genetic associations of immune pathways have implicated the microglia. The microglia are the key immune cells in the CNS which provide immunesurveillance, secrete inflammatory molecules, and clear cell debris from the extracellular space. In AD, there is an uncoupling of microglial activation and phagocytosis functions suggesting that these cells are targets for AD drug discovery. Recently, human iPS-derived microglia (iMGLs) models have started to become available. Therefore, the overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize an in vitro high throughput, high content functional suite of AD iMGLs assays with the Phenovista’s proprietary culture screening system. These assays will allow for a next-generation in vitro system for ranking the relative efficacy of AD microglial based therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is among the disorders that represents an underserved area for drug discovery and development. As a result, the successful development of a low-cost, high-performance technology for predicting the efficacy of drugs on human microglia, an important immune cell type in the brain, would help improve the development process for new AD therapies. Therefore, the goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize an in vitro high throughput human microglial assay suite using Phenovista’s proprietary culture screening system.",Microglia models for Alzheimer's disease drug screening,10156247,R43AG071341,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antibodies', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clear Cell', 'Client', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Protein', 'Extracellular Space', 'Fingerprint', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'In Vitro', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-4', 'Knock-out', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory Loss', 'Microglia', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurites', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phagocytosis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'System', 'TNFSF5 gene', 'TREM2 gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inflammatory milieu', 'macrophage', 'migration', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mutant', 'neuroinflammation', 'next generation', 'pathogen', 'screening', 'screening services', 'synaptic pruning', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'underserved area', 'uptake']",NIA,"PHENOVISTA BIOSCIENCES, LLC",R43,2021,249900
"Translational big data analytic approaches to advance drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease Project Summary  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major public health crisis with no available cure. Given recent failures of many AD clinical trials, there is an urgent need for developing effective strategies to identify new AD targets for disease modeling and new candidates for drug repurposing and development. We propose here a research project to develop transformative big data analytic approaches in the fields of translational bioinformatics, machine learning and deep learning to advance drug repurposing for AD. Our overarching goal is to develop innovative machine learning and deep learning approaches as well as informatics tools and pipelines that leverage big data in relevant biomedical domains. These big data include large-scale genetic, multi-omics, imaging, cognitive and other phenotypic data from landmark AD studies, functional interaction data among drugs, proteins and diseases, pharmacologic perturbation data, electronic health record data, and MarketScan data. Our proposed computational research is aimed at developing novel translational informatics approaches to analyze various types of molecular, clinical and other relevant data to identify individual drugs or drug combinations with favorable efficacy and toxicity profiles as candidates for repositioning against AD or AD- related dementia (ADRD). To achieve our goal, we have four Aims. Aim 1 is to develop network-based multi- omics data integration methods to identify genes and pathways as novel targets for AD drug repositioning research. Aim 2 is to develop informatics strategies to prioritize and evaluate promising candidate targets via examining their associations with AD biomarkers and phenotypes. Aim 3 is to develop knowledge-driven drug repurposing methods using network reinforcement and drug scoring to identify AD candidate drugs. Aim 4 is to prioritize and evaluate the identified candidate drugs for repurposing against AD/ADRD using pharmacologic perturbation, EHR and MarketScan data. Successful completion of these aims will produce novel translational big data analytic methods and tools to improve our understanding of the genetic, molecular and neurobiological mechanisms of AD, facilitate the identification of novel promising targets and drugs for repurposing, and ultimately have a translational impact on disease treatment and prevention. These advances are fundamental to the NIA NAPA goal of effectively treating or preventing AD/ADRD by 2025. The resulting methods and tools are also expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes.

"Alzheimer's Clinical Trial InnOvatioN (ACTION) Initiative Abstract The National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Research Implementation Milestones articulate the goals of the Institute for advancing Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. The Leadership Award for AD and Related Disorders requires that the applicant address objectives of the Milestones and provide mentorship to new and early stage investigators. The research proposed must be groundbreaking and paradigm changing. Among the eight focus areas within the Implementation Milestones' framework are Trial Innovation and Translation and Clinical Research – Pharmacological. The Alzheimer's Clinical Trial InnOvationN (ACTION) Initiative proposed here embraces both the research and mentoring aspects of the Leadership Award. The ACTION Initiative will include development of a Clinical Trials Observatory (CTO) and an embedded mentorship program. The CTO builds on the principal investigator's prior analyses of clinicaltrials.gov. This federal registry contains all trials conducted in the US and many trials conducted ex-US. It includes Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials of preclinical, prodromal, and AD dementia trials. The PI has conducted and published research on the trial design, biomarker, and clinical outcomes data from the registry. In 2016, Congress passed a law requiring that trial outcomes be posted on the site within 1 year of completion of the trial. The PI proposes to build a multi-disciplinary team of engineers, computer scientists, statisticians, and bioinformatic experts to interrogate the range of data now available using artificial intelligence techniques including machine learning and deep learning. An external advisory committee will ensure quality and dissemination. The Alzheimer's Association will collaborate on results dissemination. An accessible web portal for the database will make reviewed data readily available for analyses and prediction/modeling of planned clinical trials. The growing database of real-world AD trial data will allow increasingly precise prediction of trial outcomes based on complex relationships among baseline features, trajectories of decline, drug mechanisms, and clinical and biomarker characteristics across all stages of AD. The data will be used by the PI, mentees, academic trial leaders, and industry trial sponsors. Three initial mentees are identified from neuropsychology, psychiatry, and engineering; more will be added with growth of the program. The ACTION Initiative has the potential to transform clinical trial planning and outcomes, leading to substantial impact on the Implementation Milestones of the NIA and accelerating development of new therapies for patients with AD and those at risk. Mentees will power the future of AD drug development and clinical trial planning. Project Narrative The ACTION Initiative will develop a Clinical Trial Observatory (CTO) with an embedded mentorship program to address the NIA Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Research Implementation Milestones. The CTO will use artificial intelligence with machine learning and trial statistics to interrogate Alzheimer's clinical trial data from the comprehensive federal trial registry, clinicaltrials.gov.

"Small Molecule Modulation of S1PR Signaling for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. A disease- modifying therapeutic does not yet exist for AD and currently represents a significant, unmet medical need. Tiaki Therapeutics has discovered a signature of neuroinflammatory disease biology that is present in several neurodegenerative disorders, including a neuroinflammatory subpopulation of AD patients. Neuroinflammation plays a substantial role in the development and progression of AD and is increasingly recognized as a third disease pathology. Dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism and signaling is a significant contributor to the shared neuroinflammatory disease biology. Tiaki has created an ex vivo systems biology assay that models the same neuroinflammatory disease biology seen in patients for use in both target validation and as a functional assay to support drug discovery. Eight targets were assessed and only antagonism of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor consistently and robustly reversed the disease-associated neuroinflammatory signature. Microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the CNS, subserve a critical role in maintaining homeostasis in under normal conditions. However, under extreme circumstances microglia can be induced to enter a toxic, pro-inflammatory state. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid created through the action of sphingosine kinases (SPHKs) and signals through a family of GPCRs (S1PR1-5). Exposure of microglia to pro- inflammatory stimuli results in an increase in activity of SPHKs, production and release of S1P and subsequent activation of S1PRs, which ultimately drives NF-κB-mediated transcription and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This feedback loop establishes a self-sustaining cycle of local microglial activation that can mediate propagation of pro-inflammatory signaling. We hypothesize that alleviation of this pro-inflammatory feedback loop will restore a CNS environment where microglial protective functions are favored, thereby decreasing neurotoxicity and promoting neuronal homeostasis. The S1PR of interest is expressed on microglia and the expression of this gene is dysregulated in AD patient transcriptomes. Tiaki’s lead small molecule reverses the neuroinflammatory signature in the ex vivo slice culture assay and in vivo in a bespoke animal model that recapitulates the neuroinflammatory changes observed in patient transcriptomic data. Using a homology model and targeted analogs, we have established a robust structure-activity-relationship for modulation of the specific S1PR. Tiaki proposes further optimization and development of this lead molecule to enable clinical studies investigating the potential for specific modulation of microglial S1PRs in treating AD. To this end, we propse to: 1) Optimize the bioactivity and physicochemical properties of our lead compounds, 2) Confirm anti- inflammatory activities of lead compounds in neuroinflammation assays, and 3) obtain toxicological and safety profiles of the microglial S1PR modulators. At the end of this project, Tiaki will have a clinical candidate compound and an IND supporting future clinical studies for the modulation of neuroinflammatory AD. Narrative Neuroinflammation is a key aspect of disease biology in Alzheimer’s disease. We discovered a new way to reduce neuroinflammation by interfering with a novel signaling pathway in microglia, the immune cell of the brain. This proposal would create new compounds that could be used to develop drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease.",Small Molecule Modulation of S1PR Signaling for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,10186241,U01AG071494,"['Agonist', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Inflammatory', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Myelogenous', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Slice', 'Solubility', 'Sphingolipids', 'Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor', 'Stimulus', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'Validation', 'analog', 'base', 'brain cell', 'clinical candidate', 'cytokine', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxicity', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'receptor', 'safety study', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sphingosine 1-phosphate', 'sphingosine kinase', 'tau Proteins', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,TIAKI THERAPEUTICS INC,U01,2021,1099720
"Machine and deep learning for finding multimodal imaging biomarkers in prodromal AD Our proposed study focuses on developing deep neural networks and sophisticated multivariate analysis methods for studying episodic memory activations in prodromal AD subjects and age-matched normal controls. We are particularly interested in investigating the effects of spatial and object pattern-separation in subfields of the hippocampus, nearby regions of the medial temporal lobe, and functional whole-brain connections. In order to acquire a fuller understanding of the underlying physiological processes driving AD pathology, activations in hippocampal subfields must be investigated in further depth and with methodologies that exceed the current limitations of fMRI at 3T. Acquiring data that will yield a more accurate view of these hippocampal interactions is far more easily facilitated with 7T technology, although barriers complicate such a study even at 7T. Our proposed study centers on circumventing these barriers, particularly data contamination from excessive system noise, head-motion noise, and physiological noise which is proportional to the field strength, to develop methods that will allow investigators to work within the parameters of 7T at its fullest capacity toward the development of more powerful imaging biomarkers for diagnosing AD. To increase the likelihood of the successful completion of our study, we consider it imperative to develop better task fMRI designs and imaging protocols (Aim 1), automatic segmentation methods (Aim 2), noise-reduction methods (Aim 3), and multivariate analysis methods, such as novel algorithms and software tools based on constrained canonical correlation analysis (constrained CCA), kernel CCA, and deep CCA and relevant group-level analysis using fusion CCA, multiset CCA, and machine learning and deep learning techniques (Aim 4) for studying memory function to obtain novel imaging biomarkers (Aim 5) to identify individuals at risk for AD. This study will enable the creation of clearer and more detailed brain activation maps and thus promote the discovery of currently unknown aspects of brain function in prodromal AD. The successful completion of our objectives could lead to more effective diagnostic tools for AD, including an fMRI-based diagnostic test for memory impairment to characterize abnormal memory function in people at risk for AD. Our advanced methodology, combining 7T high-resolution fMRI, automatic segmentation, data denoising and multivariate analysis, will be essential for detecting subtle functional changes in subfields of the hippocampus and its connections to other cortical regions. Results from this study are expected to broadly impact scientific understanding of brain function beyond only enhancing current understanding of memory function in AD. We anticipate that the methods developed from findings acquired in our proposed study will have a far-reaching influence on improving fMRI data quality, enable more accurate detection of brain activation, open a path toward better automated and instantaneous hippocampal subfield segmentation for many other MRI/fMRI applications of neurodegenerative diseases, and contribute new and vital discoveries to the field of neuroscience in general. Project narrative The proposed study is highly relevant to public health because advanced mathematical and statistical methods will allow for more in-depth analysis of high-resolution fMRI data, in particular, data used in the characterization of brain function, which offers significant potential for more effective diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study will investigate memory activation in the medial temporal lobes with high-resolution imaging at 7 Tesla with multivariate analysis to identify brain dysfunction in prodromal AD. The methods developed from the findings acquired in this study will have a far-reaching influence on MRI/fMRI research in neurodegenerative diseases by improving fMRI data quality, facilitating automated and instantaneous brain segmentation, and more accurately identifying individuals at risk for AD.",Machine and deep learning for finding multimodal imaging biomarkers in prodromal AD,10181265,RF1AG071566,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Elderly', 'Encephalitis', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Work', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive function', 'data fusion', 'data quality', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'denoising', 'dentate gyrus', 'design', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'interest', 'mathematical methods', 'memory process', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prodromal Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,RF1,2021,2331558
"Beta-Amyloid Clearance Mapping in Alzheimer’s Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia that can be characterized by brain imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). MRI explains the structural changes, while PET measures represent plaque deposits in the brain according to the disease progression. The plaque deposition reflects early AD pathophysiology and presumably caused by a decrease in the removal rate of beta-amyloid through the cleaning systems of the brain. Recent studies have suggested the potential role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in carrying waste from brain tissue to the cleaning system. However, it is still not well understood how CSF flow in the brain affects waste removal. Therefore, the proposed multidisciplinary research project will involve the collaboration of investigators from diverse and complementary backgrounds (a biomechanical engineer, an MR physicist, a neuroradiologist, and cognitive neuroscientists) to address CSF flow-related AD pathophysiology. To analyze CSF flow in the narrow space between the skull and brain tissue (subarachnoid space [SAS]), we will employ computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling technique and correlate CSF flow with neuroimaging markers measured by MRI and PET. Here, the overarching hypothesis is, “Disturbed CSF flow in the SAS leads to the deposition of Amyloid plaque.” To test the hypothesis, we will take the following two steps: 1) Fifty healthy older adults will be recruited for an MRI scan. Based on anatomical and CSF velocity information measured by MRI, three-dimensional flow dynamic properties in SAS will be analyzed through CFD simulation, 2) The simulated CSF properties will be correlated with local amyloid plaque deposition by taking advantage of PET imaging data from the NIH-funded parent study (Wake Forest Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center). Here, we will propose a new imaging marker for amyloid removal for each functional brain region by combining imaging, CFD, and clinical measures. As an alternative approach, in case the new imaging markers are not useful in healthy older adults due to the small sample size, we will apply the CFD model to larger datasets for early AD adults. At the completion of this project, a new imaging tool to quantify CSF flow in the SAS and evaluate its effects on amyloid deposition and removal will be proposed. AD pathophysiology at an early stage in older adults can be analyzed using the proposed approach. Ultimately, this project will provide a biomechanical framework for the design and test of interventional and surgical procedures for the treatment of AD. The developed software programs and imaging protocols will be shared through a public software development/sharing platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, which involves structural changes as well as plaque deposits in the brain. In this research, we will develop a novel way to analyze the risk of plaque deposition and test its clinical utility. Our research will provide additional scientific insights into AD pathophysiology and improve the diagnosis of neurological diseases at an earlier stage and their monitoring over time.",Beta-Amyloid Clearance Mapping in Alzheimer’s Disease,10196303,R21AG072097,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abeta clearance', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anatomy', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animals', 'Applications Grants', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Process', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Equation', 'Excision', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging', 'Fissural', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laws', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meningeal lymphatic system', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Pontine structure', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Senile Plaques', 'Structure', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Subarachnoid Space', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Velocimetries', 'abeta accumulation', 'aging brain', 'arachnoid villi', 'base', 'biomechanical engineering', 'brain parenchyma', 'brain tissue', 'cerebrospinal fluid flow', 'cisterna magna', 'clinical center', 'cohort', 'cranium', 'design', 'forest', 'glymphatic system', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'lateral ventricle', 'lymphatic vessel', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'population based', 'pressure', 'programs', 'recruit', 'segmentation algorithm', 'serial imaging', 'sharing platform', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tau Proteins', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,426250
"KBASE2: Korean Brain Aging Study, Longitudinal Endophenotypes and Systems Biology Project Summary/Abstract The Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early Diagnosis and Prediction of AD (KBASE) is a comprehensive prospective cohort study launched at Seoul National University (SNU) in 2014 using a similar design and methods as the North American Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The KBASE cohort consists of well-characterized participants including cognitively normal (CN) controls with a wide age range (20 to 90 years), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia (AD). A unique aspect of KBASE is the systematic longitudinal collection of comprehensive clinical, cognitive and lifestyle data, multimodal neuroimaging (MRI/MRA, DTI, rsfMRI, amyloid, tau and FDG PET), and bio-specimens in Korea for the first five years (“KBASE1”). Some KBASE data have been analyzed and reported but much of the extensive KBASE data set and samples await comprehensive analysis. The proposed project (“KBASE2”) represents a collaboration between the NIA Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and partners, Indiana University (ADNI Genetics Core, Indiana NIA-designated ADRC, and IU Network Science Institute), the KBASE team at SNU in Korea, University of Southern California (USC), and the University of Pennsylvania. Over 1000 whole genome sequences (WGS) of Korean participants will be contributed to the ADSP, and the extensive ADSP multi-ethnic data set will be analyzed. WGS data will be harmonized by the NIA Genetics and Genomics Center for AD (GCAD) and shared via the NIA Genetics of AD Data Storage Site (NIAGADS). The Laboratory of Neuroimaging (LONI) at USC will support sharing of MRI and PET and related endophenotypes, as it does for ADNI. KBASE2 will continue longitudinal data and sample collection and provide high throughput WGS and RNA-Seq as well as data harmonization and sharing (Aim 1), perform intensive brain network-based analyses of longitudinal amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration and vascular (A/T/N/V) imaging biomarkers in relation to clinical data (Aim 2), employ integrative systems biology and functional genomics methods to analyze multi-omics data for association with A/T/N/V biomarkers for AD, and provide new insight into AD biomarker-related dysregulated gene modules and pathways (Aim 3). The overarching concepts driving this multidisciplinary international collaborative project are that 1) development of precision medicine for AD and related disorders (ADRD) requires systematic multi-modal biomarker collection in diverse cohorts during early at-risk stages of disease to identify robust diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets and 2) sophisticated analytic strategies that address the complexity of multi- layer multimodal data and heterogeneous and diverse participant cohorts are essential. We hypothesize that integrative longitudinal analysis of genetic and -omics networks with structural and functional brain networks will yield new diagnostic and treatment-relevant insights related to A/T/N/V and other aging related pathways. Results of this collaboration and data sharing will facilitate translation of ADSP findings for therapeutic development in support of the National Alzheimer's Project Act goal of prevention and treatment of AD by 2025. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias are a widely recognized major public health problem in the U.S. and globally.

"Muli-scale Structural Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathology and Neurodegeneration Project Summary/Abstract. Advanced biomarker mapping has led to the current understanding that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an extremely complex neurodegenerative disorder, with substantial heterogeneity in temporal and spatial characteristics of the classical amyloid and tau pathologies and resultant neurodegeneration among patients (as described by the amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration, ‘A-T-N’ biological framework that is the new standard for characterizing the neuropathology of AD). This complexity is a major barrier to clinical care and to the development of effective therapies, highlighting the importance of integrated biomarker neuromapping for understanding AD. However, substantial challenges remain in the neuropathologic characterization of patients. Current procedures for mapping the neurodegenerative component (N) of AD are limited in sensitivity to early pathology. Additionally, the specific biomarkers of the amyloid- and tau-based primary AD neuropathologies are only available through relatively invasive and/or expensive positron emission tomography (PET) and lumbar puncture (LP) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) procedures in specialized laboratories and clinics. We aim here to advance AD neuropathology mapping on multiple levels: 1) we will implement a novel multi-scale structural mapping (MSSM) MRI procedure for sensitive quantification of the neurodegeneration component of AD; 2) we will use the MSSM procedure to differentially predict amyloid and/or tau positivity in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, providing a highly accessible method for pathology detection when advanced biomarkers are not available; 3) we will create individualized ‘A-T-N’ brainmaps through the integration of the MSSM metrics with existing PET amyloid and tau data; and 4) we will use MSSM features for the regional prediction of amyloid and tau pathology for use when PET data are not available. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1. To test the accuracy of a novel MSSM procedure for probabilistic classification of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals as being amyloid “positive” or tau “positive.” Hypothesis 1a (H1a). We hypothesize that MSSM ‘N’ metric can be used with a high level of sensitivity to predict whether an individual is A+ measured via PET using standard thresholds and/or T+ measured via PET using standard thresholds, or both. H1b. MSSM will provide better separation of individuals as N+ vs. N- than conventional MRI-based atrophy measures, validated through concordance with molecular pathology and clinical progression. Aim 2. To utilize the novel MSSM features for synthesis of PET-like maps of AD neuropathologic change. H2a. MSSM features will provide accurate spatial prediction of specific regional neuropathologic changes. Prediction accuracy will be measured against independent in vivo datasets including a subset with autopsy confirmation and regional quantification of plaques, tangles, and neuronal loss. Successful MSSM implementation would greatly advance the ability to screen for early and complex AD neuropathology. Successful MSSM implementation would greatly advance the ability to screen for AD neuropathology. Project Narrative.

"Identification of Mild Cognitive Impairment using Machine Learning from Language and Behavior Markers Project Summary Recent estimates indicate that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may rank as the third leading cause of death for older people in the United States, just behind heart disease and cancer. While scientists know that AD involves a progressive brain cell failure, the reason why cells fail is still not clear. To understand the progression of the disease, one of the keys is to investigate the cognitive changes in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Even though biomarkers such as imaging and clinical functions are found to be outstanding in differentiating AD patients from those with normal cognition (NC), studies suggest that their discriminative power in early-stage MCI are rather limited. Detecting signals which distinguish subjects with MCI from those with NC is challenging due to the low sensitivity and high variability of current clinical measures such as annually assessed neuropsychological test results and self-reported functional measurements. Moreover, even though in-vivo biomarkers such as beta-amyloid and tau can be used as indicators of pathological progression towards AD, the screening of biomarkers are prohibitively expensive to be widely used among pre-symptomatic individuals in the outpatient setting. We hypothesize that progressive cognitive impact from MCI has elicited detectable changes in the way people talk and behave, which can be sensed by inexpensive and accessible sensors and leveraged by machine learning (ML) algorithms to build predictive models for quantifying the risk of MCI. Our preliminary results on a small cohort indicated that there are significant differences between MCI and NC subjects during a semi-structured conversation, and ML algorithms can use such differences for differentiating MCI and NC with promising performance. Our preliminary results in behavior monitoring also suggest highly predictive performance using temporal patterns of behavior signals. In this project, we plan to build upon our initial success and conduct comprehensive studies on language and behavior markers in larger-scale cohorts to build high-performance and interpretable ML models for screening MCI. Our three Specific Aims are: (1) Discover language markers and develop predictive models characterizing MCI. Using interview recordings from the I-CONECT project, we will use natural language processing and ML algorithms to extract linguistic and acoustic markers and develop multi- modal learning algorithms to fuse the two types of information. (2) Discover behavior markers and develop predictive models characterizing MCI. Using the in-home monitoring data from ORCATECH, we will extract short-term and long-term behavior patterns and integrate multi-granularity behavior markers to differentiate MCI and NC. (3) Linking language and behavior markers with an information framework. We will use demographics and common clinical information to profile the patients and match the two cohorts via certain similarity metrics, creating complementary features for improved prediction. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently affects more than 5 million Americans and leads to progressive memory loss without effective treatments to date. Early and accurate identification of its prodromal state, mild cognitive impairment, are critical for clinical-trial enrichment as well as early intervention of the AD.

"Validation of a Virtual Reality Floor Maze Test to Detect Early Signs of Cognitive Impairment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Early diagnosis and identification of predictors for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is crucial as it allows intervention with prevention and treatment strategies when neuronal loss is at its minimum. Spatial navigation is a complex and multi-component skill that gets impaired early in the course of brain diseases and may be considered a relevant, sensitive and specific marker for future clinical progress of AD, even in its preclinical stage. Active spatial navigation assessments allow to identify modifications of gait associated with cognitive decline, and to amplify the difficulty of the test through a dual task effect created by the increased postural demands of walking. This study will validate the first motor-cognitive screening instrument able to extract digital markers in the form of navigational and gait performances in people at risk of developing AD. We propose that a fully immersive Virtual Reality (VR) navigational test has numerous advantages with respect to classical tests because it allows the manipulation of environmental features based on specific needs. We will use a VR version of the Floor Maze Test (VR-FMT) to create virtual mazes with preferred complexity and display them within a commercial VR headset. Cognitively normal adults at low risk and higher risk of developing AD and subjects with amnesic mild cognitive impairment will complete two visits. In the first visit, a battery of neuropsychological tests will be taken. In the second, participants will perform multiple navigations inside the VR-FMT. Two visuals representations (vista and environmental), and two explorations types (real walking and with a joystick) will be tested. Gait will be recorded using VR trackers and a motion capture system. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will be used to measure resting-state brain connectivity. In Aim 1 we will validate the gait measures and the manipulations operated by the VR-FMT. We hypothesize that the portable trackers will show comparable validity in measuring gait compared to the optical motion capture system and that participants will show different navigation performance in the walking and the in-place versions and in the environmental and vista spaces versions of the VR-FMT. In Aim 2 we will investigate the ability of the VR-FMT as a test to differentiate the various levels of cognitive impairment. We hypothesize that navigation performance while performing the active version of the VR-FMT in the environmental space would show superior ability to distinguish the groups. Then, a machine learning algorithm will be used to extract the most significant features and classify participants. We hypothesize that both gait and navigation performances would increase the sensitivity of the classifier. In Aim 3 we will explore associations between performance in the VR-FMT, neuropsychological tests, and brain connectivity. We hypothesize that lower navigation performance will be associated with altered brain connectivity and lower psychomotor speed, memory and executive function scores. Findings from this research will set the stage for further longitudinal studies which will be aimed at predicting accumulating AD biomarkers. The long-term goal is to develop an accurate, low-cost, user-friendly, and portable system that can be used to predict cognitive decline. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early diagnosis and identification of predictors for dementia is crucial as it allows for intervention with prevention and treatment strategies which can stop or delay progress. This 2-year project will develop and validate a real-space navigation test with a fully immersive virtual reality headset that detects signs of dementia by measuring navigation and gait abilities. The knowledge generated during this study will help scientists and engineers understand how navigational abilities change in older adults at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and could be useful to develop an affordable and accurate test to predict and detect cognitive decline using a portable virtual reality system.",Validation of a Virtual Reality Floor Maze Test to Detect Early Signs of Cognitive Impairment,10214391,R21AG072469,"['Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Joystick', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Optics', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Posture', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'functional decline', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'minimally invasive', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'portability', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual reality headset', 'virtual reality system', 'visual-vestibular', 'way finding']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R21,2021,355890
"Smartphone Pupillometer for At-Home Screening for Risk of Alzheimer’s Disease Project Summary/Abstract Dementia represents one of the most important public health concerns in the coming decades. Among the most important research goals will be to identify the earliest, most reliable and easily obtainable biomarkers of degeneration, because early identification of individuals most likely to decline now represents the most promising window for therapeutic interventions. The main objective of this project is to develop an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) screening solution based completely on a smartphone application that converts the phone’s facial recognition IR camera into a mobile pupillometer. Our scientific premise, demonstrated by our recent clinical findings, is that pupillary responses provide a biomarker of cognitive effort required to perform tasks before overt performance declines are manifest. Pupil size during cognitive tasks (e.g., digit span recall) increases in response to increased demands, is inversely related to cognitive ability (individuals with lower ability show greater dilation/compensatory effort), and pupil size decreases and performance declines when task demands exceed abilities and compensatory capacity. Someone requiring more effort to achieve the same score as another person is likely to be closer to maximum compensatory capacity and, therefore, at higher risk for decline. We have found that individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who are at greater risk for AD, show greater dilation (effort) on the digit span task, and that greater dilation is associated with greater polygenic risk for AD and neuroimaging indicators of locus coeruleus (LC) dysfunction. This is important because pupillary responses reflect LC functioning, and postmortem studies implicate the LC as an early site of AD pathogenesis and degenerative changes with disease progression. Thus, pupillary responses may serve as a specific biomarker of functional alterations in a brain system affected by the earliest manifestations of AD. Currently, pupillary responses can be measured in as little as 5 minutes using minimally invasive, but expensive and complicated office-based devices. To increase the scalability of pupillometry screening in AD, we propose to develop a smartphone assessment that older adults can administer themselves at home that tracks small changes in pupil dilation during cognitive tasks. We will further develop and evaluate different machine learning algorithms that use the pupillary response biomarker measured by the phone to perform automated risk assessment of severity of mild cognitive impairment at the early stages of AD. Because the project would be carried out in the context of a larger NIA-funded RF1 affiliated with the UC San Diego Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), it will be possible to validate mobile pupillometry assessments against gold-standard in-lab pupillometry in older adults with MCI, early AD, and healthy controls. Our translational goal is to provide access to low-cost at-home screening for people who are potentially at early stages of dementia. In addition, the creation of a low-cost and accurate pupillometer that can be immediately deployed through smartphones will open-up new opportunities for large scale cognition studies that require measurement of pupillary response frequently in daily life settings. Project Narrative Recent research has shown that pupillary responses, an index of how much cognitive effort is needed to perform a memory task, may provide a new biomarker of early risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD); people who have to try harder to perform the task may be closer to cognitive decline. This project aims to develop a self- administrable pupillometer for older adults that uses a smartphone’s built-in IR camera to record pupillary responses during a digit span memory task, with the goal of enabling a machine learning-based automated assessment of risk for cognitive decline. An automated phone-sensor based early stage AD screening tool has the power to enable broad screening of the population of older adults at low cost at-home, in low-resource clinics, and through community health services.",Smartphone Pupillometer for At-Home Screening for Risk of Alzheimer’s Disease,10214386,R21AG072534,"['Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Community Health Services', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digit structure', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Home', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mydriasis', 'Older Population', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'minimally invasive', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'specific biomarkers']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2021,392099
"Multi-omic functional assessment of novel AD variants using high-throughput and single-cell technologies PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Through decades of research, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified heritable coding and noncoding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that lead to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the vast majority of these SNPs remain largely under-characterized, and their contribution to AD pathogenesis remains unclear, marking a critical roadblock to our understanding of AD genetics and pathogenesis. While SNPs within the APOE and TREM2 genes have identified vital nodes in AD biology, most AD-related SNPs reside within the noncoding genome, making their functional roles in the disease less clear. Co-inheritance of nearby SNPs (linkage disequilibrium) and the cell type-specificity of noncoding regulatory elements further complicate functional annotation of noncoding SNPs in AD. As part of the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Functional Genomics Consortium (ADSP FGC), this project will provide a robust and conclusive functional characterization of AD-related noncoding SNPs. To do this, we will first create a comprehensive single-cell atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility across a cohort of diverse clinico-pathologic states related to AD (Aim 1). Using these cell type-specific gene regulatory landscapes, we will develop and implement innovative machine learning and statistical genomics methods to predict functional noncoding, splicing, and coding SNPs (Aim 2). We will then validate these predictions using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and large-scale, scarless, single-base CRISPR editing of iPSCs followed by cell type-specific differentiations (Aim 3). Taken together (Aim 4), this project will pinpoint the functional SNPs and target cell types for dozens of AD-related risk loci and provide an unprecedented picture of the gene regulatory landscape of AD. This work will be performed as a joint collaboration between Stanford University and the Gladstone Institutes at UCSF. Our team, with many long-standing collaborations, has extensive experience in consortium science with long-term involvement in the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and The Genotype-Tissue Expression Project. The proposed project is thus well- positioned to integrate into the highly collaborative ADSP Functional Genomics Consortium. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease, the third most common cause of mortality in the United States, and a looming public health crisis. Despite over a decade of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), our understanding of the genetics of this devastating disease remains incomplete, as functional validation of relevant polymorphisms has proved challenging. Through a platform of multi-omic single-cell data generation, innovative machine learning and statistical genomics refinement, and functional characterization, we will pinpoint AD-relevant polymorphisms that will identify novel aspects of disease pathogenesis and nominate candidate avenues for therapeutic intervention.",Multi-omic functional assessment of novel AD variants using high-throughput and single-cell technologies,10217784,U01AG072573,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia with Lewy Bodies', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Inherited', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Specificity', 'TREM2 gene', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome editing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'presenilin-1', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'single cell technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'syntax', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,1698183
"Validation of the DCTclock drawing task as a cognitive screening tool for prodromal Alzheimers disease in the Framingham Heart Study Abstract. The diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has traditionally depended on fluid biomarkers and neuroimaging. However, these tests are often invasive, expensive, and generally available only in specialty clinics. Common neuropsychological tests used to screen for dementia (e.g., Mini-Mental State Examination) are not sensitive enough to detect early cognitive changes that can predict the emergence of prodromal AD. The DCTclockTM is an FDA approved digital neuropsychological test with the potential to be deployed in primary care and clinical trials research as a non-invasive and cost-effective screening tool for detecting the earliest stages of AD. The DCTclockTM can be easily administered by any healthcare professional and uses cutting-edge methods to capture nuanced neuropsychological behavior. Initial studies suggest that the DCTclockTM has high sensitivity to predict cortical amyloid (Aß) deposition and parietal hypometabolism on neuroimaging, suggesting that it could serve as a surrogate for more invasive or costly biomarker testing. This project will validate the DCTclockTM in a large sample of older adults from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), using cross sectional and longitudinal approaches with the goals of determining: (1) the DCTclock’s ability to distinguishing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from normal aging relative to existing cognitive screening measures, (2) its associations with genetic biomarkers of AD and neuroimaging measures of AD pathology, including MRI metrics and brain Aß levels on a PET scan. DCTclockTM drawing data has been collected in the FHS since 2011 from over 1,600 older adults without dementia, making it an ideal database for this validation study. Project Narrative. The development of efficient and cost-effective screening tools that can accurately detect cognitive changes during the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is of paramount importance for the advancement of AD clinical research and care. The objective of this study is to conduct a large-scale validation of the DCTclock, a digital cognitive screening measure, using existing data from the Framingham Heart Study. Our goal is to advance the DCTclock as a first line screening measure for identifying persons at risk for AD and related dementias in order to improve early detection and facilitate prevention research.",Validation of the DCTclock drawing task as a cognitive screening tool for prodromal Alzheimers disease in the Framingham Heart Study,10214193,R21AG072588,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'FDA approved', 'Foundations', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention Research', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Validation', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Work', 'abeta deposition', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical care', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'genome wide association study', 'gray matter', 'health disparity', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'medical specialties', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropathology', 'normal aging', 'patient screening', 'primary care setting', 'processing speed', 'prodromal Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'validation studies', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,231533
"Lens β-Amyloid Biomarker for Early Detection of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Study Recent research advances have led to detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and development of emerging disease-modifying therapies. Yet effective treatment remains elusive. Repeated failure of AD clinical trials has focused attention on preclinical AD that begins with clinically silent accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain and progresses to onset of cognitive symptoms. Early detection of preclinical AD is now recognized as a prerequisite for effective treatment. Aβ is an accepted “gold standard” AD biomarker. Available methods to assess Aβ burden rely on positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. These methods are expensive, invasive, cumbersome, not widely available, and difficult to scale. The NIA has identified development of new, safe, sensitive, cost-efficient, point-of-care technology to detect preclinical AD as a high-priority goal. This project addresses this unmet need by accelerating testing of an innovative drug-device combination eye scanner (Sapphire II) that detects AD-related Aβ in the lens. This novel approach is based on our discovery of AD-specific Aβ lens pathology in patients with pathologically-confirmed AD, but not other non-AD neurodegenerative diseases or normal aging. Moreover, we found that AD-related pathology and phenotypes are expressed far earlier in lens than brain in Framingham Eye Study participants. This and related research led to development of the Sapphire II system that combines a topically-applied Aβ-binding fluorescent ligand (Aftobetin) and a purpose-designed eye scanner with integrated fluorescent lifetime decay spectroscopy analyzer. The eye scanner and ligand reliably measure lens Aβ with high specificity, sensitivity, and signal-to-noise ratio. In Phase 2 clinical trials, the Sapphire II system showed high positive and negative predictive values for AD diagnosis and differentiated mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and clinical AD from normal controls with greater sensitivity and specificity than amyloid-PET scans. This project leverages opportunistic timing of NHLBI-funded basic health exams by adding lens Aβ measurements in well- characterized, community-based longitudinal cohorts in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Specifically, we will evaluate lens Aβ burden in two older FHS cohorts (Aim 1; Gen 2, multi-ethnic OmniGen 1) and two middle-aged FHS cohorts (Aim 2; Gen 3, multi-ethnic OmniGen 2), each with longitudinal neuropsychological test battery results, concurrent MRI brains scans, and ancillary datasets relevant to cognitive decline and AD. Lens Aβ measurement will be evaluated using stratified analyses for age, sex, ApoE genotype, and AD risk factors (Aim 3) and computational modeling to construct multi-marker predictive profiles for AD (Aim 4). Results will be used to test our project hypothesis that lens Aβ burden will be elevated in middle-aged and older FHS participants who show evidence of cognitive decline (memory deficits, executive dysfunction), AD neuroimaging biomarkers, or clinical AD. Project results are expected to accelerate clinical introduction of lens Aβ burden as an objective measure to evaluate AD risk, detect preclinical AD, and assess early AD and progression in individual patients. This project will accelerate evaluation of an innovative drug-device combination eye scanner that specifically measures β-amyloid (Aβ) in the ocular lens for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We will test the project hypothesis that elevated Aβ burden in the lens is predictive of cognitive decline and early, pre- symptomatic (preclinical) AD in older and middle-aged longitudinal community-based cohorts in the Framingham Heart Study.",Lens β-Amyloid Biomarker for Early Detection of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Study,10214179,RF1AG072589,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain scan', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Cost of Illness', 'Crystalline Lens', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Down Syndrome', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Fluorescence Spectroscopy', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Point of Care Technology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sapphire', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Topical application', 'Woman', 'abeta accumulation', 'age group', 'amyloid pathology', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'beta amyloid pathology', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning algorithm', 'delta-catenin', 'design', 'detection platform', 'disease phenotype', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'genome wide association study', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'lens', 'medical schools', 'men', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multi-ethnic', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging marker', 'non-demented', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'presenilin-1', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'white matter', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,RF1,2021,1682982
"Precision Brain Health Monitoring for Alzheimer's Disease Risk Detection in the Framingham Study Project Summary The path to effective treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) depends on disease detection that occurs before it is too late to reverse progression. Amyloid beta (Aß) is the widely accepted ""gold standard"" biomarker of AD and current methods for measuring this biomarker rely on positron emission tomography (PET) scans and/or analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These AD biomarker acquisition methods, however, are expensive, invasive, and difficult to scale and reliance on these approaches have exacerbated racial and ethnic disparities in AD research. Digital technologies offer an alternative method for clinical phenotyping that can detect AD-related changes well before the threshold of clinical symptom severity meets diagnostic criteria. Further, digital phenotyping makes possible the identification and validation of digital biomarkers by determining digital indices that correlate highly with more widely-accepted biological biomarkers. Within this context, this application seeks to capitalize on the opportunistic timing of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) middle-aged Generation 3 and Omni Generations 2 cohorts as participants return for their NHLBI-funded 4th health examination. The NHLBI funding, however, only covers costs associated with about 20% of the health exam components. The remaining 80% of the health exam will be determined by ancillary studies such as the project proposed here. This project aims to add two new components to the Gen 3/OmniGen 2 health exam. Aim 1 proposes conducting a novel lens Aβ eye scan that pairs a topically-applied fluorescent Aβ-binding ligand with a specialized spectroscopic eye scanner that can detect Aß deposition in the lens of the eye and has demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity to detect early AD-related Aβ pathology compared to amyloid-PET brain scans. Aim 2 seeks to use a smartphone application to collect 3 years of longitudinal cognitive metrics from which to characterize those with stable cognition versus declining cognition. Proposed analyses across these two aims will test the overall hypothesis that novel digital cognitive profiles that are unique combinations of digital features (e.g., item-specific responses, latencies, error rates, acoustic and linguistic measures) can detect those who are lens Aβ positive and/or at high AD risk (e.g., high cardiovascular risk, ApoE4+, family history of dementia, women, age >60+). Aim 3 will further apply traditional a priori and novel data-driven machine learning computational tools to construct multi-marker profiles that are highly predictive (AUC > .85) of stable cognition and cognitive decline. We posit that machine learning methods will generate more highly predictive models specific to digital cognitive profiles as compared to a priori methods. Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to collect a novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker and longitudinal digital cognitive data using a smartphone. Together these data will allow testing the overall hypothesis that it is possible to detect preclinical AD at a much earlier age than previously assumed.",Precision Brain Health Monitoring for Alzheimer's Disease Risk Detection in the Framingham Study,10214162,RF1AG072654,"['Acoustics', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Crystalline Lens', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Eye', 'Family history of', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Ligand Binding', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Response Latencies', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Topical application', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abeta accumulation', 'abeta deposition', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data resource', 'dementia risk', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'indexing', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'middle age', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'sex', 'smartphone Application', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,RF1,2021,1836408
"NOVEL EXOSOME BIOMARKERS OF IRON PATHOLOGY IN AD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) afflicts millions of Americans, yet no effective treatments exist. Iron has been shown to be involved in key AD pathologic processes, including amyloid and tau aggregation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death mechanisms. Despite this growing evidence, it is challenging to ascertain alterations in iron metabolism in vivo, limiting potential translation to biomarkers and novel therapies. Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles shed by cells to transport proteins, nucleic acids, metals, lipids or metabolites. While exosomes reflect cellular processes and can reveal disease-related pathologies in human tissues and biofluids, iron abnormalities in AD exosomes have not yet been investigated. We will address this knowledge gap through state-of-the-art exosome isolation technology combined with advanced iron imaging, protein quantification and next generation sequencing methods. Our goal is to investigate iron dysregulation in exosomes from post- mortem AD brains, in order to unveil AD-specific biomarkers and facilitate the development of novel therapies.  The project aims are: (1) To determine whether the quantity, oxidation state, and cellular origin of exosomal iron is altered in AD. Using MRI and synchrotron X-ray microscopy, we will quantify tissue iron content and oxidation state in human AD and control hippocampal specimens. We will then use our novel exosome isolation platform, ExoTIC, to isolate exosomes from regions of high hippocampal iron content in the same specimens. Using antibodies that target cell-surface proteins, we will enrich the isolated exosomes based on their cellular origin (e.g. neurons, microglia, etc.). We will quantify exosomal iron content from each cell type using mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and measure exosomal iron oxidation state using electron microscopy. Taken together, we will determine whether iron content and oxidation state are altered in Alzheimer’s exosomes compared to controls, in particular in exosomes originating in microglia, the brain’s immune cells. (2) Detect dysregulation of iron-related proteins and RNAs in AD exosomes. Using Western blotting on the enriched exosomes, we will determine whether levels of proteins that play a role in iron metabolism are altered in AD compared to controls. Because exosomes are generally rich in microRNAs that are known to regulate gene expression, we will use RNA-Seq to determine whether exosomal microRNAs regulating these same iron-related proteins are also altered in AD. Machine learning algorithms will enable the creation of an atlas of microRNAs linking iron, iron-related proteins, and neuropathology, which should provide a deeper understanding of AD biology.  Characterization of exosome content in the AD brain should result in cell-specific signatures of iron dysregulation associated with neurodegeneration. This approach may elucidate novel aspects of AD biology, lead to novel assays to detect early AD, and facilitate a much-needed future therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence and cost, investigations focusing on abnormal proteins (amyloid and tau) have yet to yield an efficacious treatment, so alternative mechanisms need to be investigated. Iron dysregulation is widespread in AD yet is difficult to quantify in living humans using existing methods: we propose to investigate iron dysregulation using exosomes, tiny vesicles shed from brain cells that offer unique information on active cellular processes. Using a novel exosome isolation platform integrated with advanced iron imaging and next generation sequencing, we will identify signatures of iron dysregulation associated with brain cells in AD, which can provide novel pharmaceutical targets towards a much-needed future therapy.",NOVEL EXOSOME BIOMARKERS OF IRON PATHOLOGY IN AD,10223789,R21AG072675,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Antibodies', 'Astrocytes', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Ceruloplasmin', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electron energy loss spectroscopy', 'Exhibits', 'Ferritin', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pensions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproducibility', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Synchrotrons', 'TFRC gene', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transferrin', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vesicle', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'X ray microscopy', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'disorder control', 'divalent metal', 'effective therapy', 'efficacious treatment', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'hepcidin', 'human tissue', 'image reconstruction', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intercellular communication', 'iron metabolism', 'iron oxidation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metal transporting protein 1', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oxidation', 'population based', 'specific biomarkers', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,433029
"Understanding the dynamic interactions between tau pathology and microgliamediated inflammation in Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract The etiology, mechanism and progression of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and the relationship of AD pathology to clinical manifestations, are not fully understood. Emerging studies suggest that inflammation and microglial activation is an important contributor to AD pathogenesis and progression. The association between tau and microglia is especially critical, since tau is most closely associated with AD. The conventionally accepted sequence of this interaction is that misfolded tau, which is pro-inflammatory, causes microglial activation, leading to dendritic pruning and eventually neuronal cell death. However, it is recently emerging that microglial activation can itself cause tau aggregation and subsequent propagation. Therefore the causality of these interactions is controversial, and requires much needed elucidation in humans in vivo. The goal of this proposal is to understand the interaction and causal sequencing between tau, neurodegeneration, microglia and systemic inflammation in governing the etiology and progression of human AD. This proposal involves a series of principled statistical and mathematical model-based tests that will uncover these relationships, for the first time, directly in patients. This proposal involves a new prospective longitudinal study of 100 AD spectrum patients acquiring brain MRI and PET imaging of activated microglia using a new generation TSPO ligand called DPA-713 and tau-PET imaging using a relatively novel ligand, MK6240. The same imaging protocol (MRI, DPA-713 and MK6240 PET) will be repeated at 18- and 36-month follow up time points. All subjects will have amyloid neuritic plaque density measured at baseline using florbetaben PET. Next this proposal involves developing and testing a model of microglial inflammation-tau interaction via mathematical models to determine whether regional microglia-mediated neuroinflammation measured by DPA-PET is higher in AD spectrum patients or in cognitively normal older adults; and whether regional microglial activation is predictable directly from tau and/or amyloid. Finally, this proposed research includes testing a network spread model of tau and microglia. Mounting animal data implicate a trans-neuronal transmission mechanism of tau through brain networks. Using a network diffusion model of disease spread, this proposal will further investigate the role of microglia in tau progression directly in humans. Since tau and microglia provide complementary signal about evolving pathology, this proposal will determine whether combining imaging studies that measure both biomarkers will result in a uniquely powerful and predictive test of AD progression. Given the rapidly evolving understanding of the role of microglia and systemic inflammation in dementias, the current proposal is timely, topical and necessary for advancing human dementia research. If successful, it will give the first validated spatiotemporal model of the causal interactions between pathology and neuroinflammation in AD, catalyzing future advances in prognostication and targeted anti-inflammatory therapies. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) poses an increasingly large public health burden. By providing new insights into the role of neuroinflammation in AD, this study will provide the foundation for future advances in prognostication and targeted anti-inflammatory therapies for this devastating disease.",Understanding the dynamic interactions between tau pathology and microgliamediated inflammation in Alzheimer's Disease,10317631,R01AG072753,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Atrophic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Risk', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Linear Models', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Senile Plaques', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'TREM2 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'animal data', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'follow-up', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'model design', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prognostic', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tau interaction', 'tau mutation', 'tractography', 'transmission process']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,1141642
"A Study of Race Differences in Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers Abstract  We propose to combine mass spectrometry and machine learning to address racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. While African Americans have two to three times the incidence rates of AD than people of European Ancestry, they are underrepresented in past and current AD research studies. The lack of representation leads to a weaker understanding of disease progression and poorer diagnostics for this population. The overarching premise, that advances in diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease for all Americans will be stymied unless differences among racial groups are considered, is supported by the literature and demonstrated with preliminary data in the application. The aims of this proposal are, therefore, designed to specifically address the need for a better understanding of Alzheimer's disease in minority groups and to increase the diversity of patients that could be correctly diagnosed with serum-based biomarker panels for AD. Successful completion of the proposed research would accomplish several objectives: We would identify optimal feature selection methods for `omics data; generate the best possible plasma biomarker panel for AD in African Americans; and provide a systematic investigation of the extent to which existing MS- `omics studies' accuracy of predicting AD are modulated by the participants' race. Project Narrative: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a better understanding of race-associated differences in Alzheimer's disease so that plasma-based biomarker panels can be developed for a diverse group of Americans.",A Study of Race Differences in Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers,10234957,RF1AG072760,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Education', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Goals', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Institutional Racism', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer biomarkers', 'design', 'feature selection', 'field study', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'lipidomics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial bias', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'research study', 'sex']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,RF1,2021,1123467
"Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Project Summary – IADRC Overall The Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (IADRC) was established in 1991 to bring investigators and institutional resources at the Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) together to address the fundamental causes and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Despite many important gains, the need for targeted research is greater than ever, with an estimated 5.8 million people in the U.S. suffering from AD/ADRD. Unfortunately, we do not yet know how to prevent AD or have an approved disease modifying intervention. Both are critical to stem the growth in dementia prevalence. The overarching goal of the IADRC going forward is to support the goal of the NAPA to prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025, through innovative research on etiology, early detection, and therapeutics. Biomarker studies indicate that processes leading to AD begin at least 20 years prior to dementia, suggesting that successful interventions must be implemented early. This presents a potential opportunity for early intervention, but the field is challenged by critical barriers decreasing the prospects of timely success. The IADRC has identified the barriers as: a) The current understanding of etiology and pathophysiology is fragmented and incomplete; b) Sensitive, specific, and cost-effective methods for early detection are not available; c) Therapeutic development is hampered by the heterogeneity and complexity of ADRD; d) Shortage of data and translational scientists; and, e) Inadequate diversity at all levels. The IADRC specific aims entail innovation to overcome these barriers and accelerate research toward prevention and effective treatment: 1) Support, enhance, and expand innovative research on ADRD targeting causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention; 2) Provide critical research resources and infrastructure to support existing studies and enable new innovative research, utilizing a well-characterized longitudinal clinical cohort, with prioritization of diverse populations including underrepresented groups (URG) and those in preclinical and early symptomatic phases, including subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment, which will help to advance the identification of easily accessible biomarkers for early detection; 3) Identify and prioritize novel therapeutic targets from high-throughput approaches with rapid translation to proof- of-concept studies using genetic and other enrichment strategies for better biological targeting and reduction of phenotypic and biological heterogeneity for more efficient and cost-effective clinical trials; 4) Increase the number of investigators with deep expertise in advanced data sciences to bridge cellular/molecular processes of neurodegeneration and clinical phenotypes, as well as clinical and translational researchers who can move therapeutic approaches from model systems to clinical trials; 5) Provide educational and training opportunities related to dementia for a broad array of learners, with special emphasis on increasing participation from URG in ADRD related research and healthcare specialties. The IADRC is well-positioned to help achieve the NIA/NAPA goals through sustained and impactful contributions towards prevention and treatment of AD/ADRD.

"Development of perivascular space mapping toolset as a diagnostic aid for Alzheimer's disease Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating disease that affects millions of Americans and imposes a huge socio- economic burden. AD-related cognitive decline is associated with the accumulation of Aβ (Amyloid beta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which are insufficiently cleared and degraded by mechanisms such as the glia-lymphatic system or by transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Animal research has shown that the glia-lymphatic pathway plays a substantial role in the net clearance of Aβ. In addition, reduction of interstitial fluid efflux to the cerebrospinal fluid, or reduction of transport across the BBB, could lessen the Aβ clearance. Human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have also shown that the integrity of the perivascular space (PVS), the pathway of glia-lymphatic system, is a marker of glia-lymphatic brain health and its alteration is an important feature of AD pathology. PVS alteration in AD has been shown to be independent of Amyloid uptake, implicating astroglial involvement specific to AD. Information about PVS integrity could assist clinicians with making specific diagnosis about patients AD status and mechanism. Therefore, a tool that allows non-invasive in-vivo mapping of PVS from clinical MRI is of high significance to aid AD diagnosis and disease monitoring but does not yet exist. Current clinical routine to investigate PVS is a relatively crude approach based on counting total number of observed PVS in MRI by neuro-radiologists, which is non-specific, rater-dependent, and does not capture the distribution, whole extent of PVS change nor volumetric features of the PVS. From a practical point of view, this technique is time consuming and laborious. These limitations in part have prevented neurologists from adopting PVS quantification into their clinical routine. We have developed computational techniques for mapping and quantifying PVS morphology from MRI, which enables automated and accurate quantification of PVS across the brain without the need for time consuming manual intervention. These techniques were developed on research data, which had slightly higher resolution than clinical MRI. The goal of this proposal is to validate and optimize this technology on clinical MRI data, which can be variable in quality and resolution. We also aim to develop a scanner- and hardware-agnostic deployable analytical solution for automated PVS quantification, so that PVS mapping can be performed independent of the radiology/imaging IT infrastructure. If successful, we will have a fully developed and validated backend software that enables automated assessment of PVS and aids specific AD diagnosis and disease monitoring. Upon the completion of this goal, our Phase II will focus on translation of the technology via implementation and testing of the technology in collaboration with our strategic partners in clinic (Neuroradiology division of Keck School of Medicine), industry (BioGen Inc.) and research (MarkVCID and NASA). Our ultimate goal will be to integrate PVS measures into clinical diagnosis, disease monitoring and intervention efficacy assessment, as a specific non-invasive and in-vivo imaging marker of AD pathology that can be automatically and reliably measured. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because identifying pathological alterations to the brain perivascular spaces is expected to aid in Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and disease monitoring. Traditionally, assessment of perivascular spaces in clinic was limited to visual counting on MRI, which is time consuming and inaccurate. The aim of this proposal is to develop and optimize reliable automated techniques to map perivascular spaces in clinical setting.",Development of perivascular space mapping toolset as a diagnostic aid for Alzheimer's disease,10255954,R41AG073024,"['Abeta clearance', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Axon', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intercellular Fluid', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphatic', 'Lymphatic System', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologist', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Senile Plaques', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Distribution', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'brain health', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost estimate', 'efficacy evaluation', 'human data', 'hyperphosphorylated tau', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'insight', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'medical schools', 'neuroimaging', 'neurovascular', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protein aggregation', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'technology validation', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vascular cognitive impairment and dementia', 'wasting']",NIA,NEUROSCOPE INC.,R41,2021,461031
"An AI-assisted screening platform within a multivariate framework for biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease PROJECT SUMMARY Accumulating evidence indicates that every 65 seconds, someone develops Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the United States, and over 5.7 million Americans have the condition. Alzheimer's and other dementias will cost the nation $277 Billion by 2050. The major problem is that many people with cognitive impairment (CI) may not know they have it because dementia is underdiagnosed and underreported. There is a lack of low-cost and non- invasive screening instruments to identify individuals at risk for CI with high accuracy automatically. Therefore, considering the global and societal implications of the dementia epidemic, better strategies are needed to identify patients at risk for dementia. An eye health evaluation offers a unique perspective on the health of our eyes and our bodies. For example, visual observation of the retina as a diagnostic modality is already widely used to detect high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and even brain tumors since a physician can see the optic nerve, which is part of the brain. Thus, an eye test may also be a potential solution to detect CI. While early manifestations of numerous risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease) have been found in the human retina, they may confound the first signs of CI. In healthcare, the complexity and rise in data volume have contributed to the remarkable worldwide interest of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in medicine. Therefore, we aim to provide a practical near-term risk assessment of CI through AI, by identifying and utilizing novel multivariate biomarkers (including eye markers) with a better discrimination power. In this Phase I STTR, iScreen 2 Prevent, LLC, the University of Miami, and the iCareHub, LLC, will develop an AI-based screening platform for early detection of CI due to AD. Our preliminary data show that multivariate eye biomarkers are related to cognitive status and can be used to discriminate mild CI patients from cognitively healthy subjects (age-matched (55+ years old), area under the receiving operating curve (AUROC)=0.90 (SE=0.050), p<0.001). However, multivariate biomarkers need to be combined at the point of screening to enhance the accuracy of predictions, and biomarker methodologies could be advanced using AI. We aim to integrate and optimize our eye screening framework (iScreen 2 Predict™) into a digital health platform (iCAREHub) that collects personalized, comprehensive clinical data at the point of care. We also aim to develop an AI-based model with the integrated multivariate markers and test the iScreen 2 Predict™ software's ability to discriminate patients with mild CI due to AD. This project fills a critical technology gap in the field of AD diagnostics. While the number of screening tools using unimodal and expensive biomarkers continues to grow, these tools do not consider multivariate data generated during the routine care in a collective and automated way. Thus, their diagnostic potential is limited. The development of our software as a medical device (SaMD) for detecting CI due to AD earlier, considering multifactorial variables and relevant biomarkers of ocular-brain abnormalities related to cognitive status, will allow earlier intervention and facilitate better management of the disease's primary cognitive symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia among older people. Unfortunately, current diagnostic technologies are limited because they predict cognitive impairment too late and cannot capture various risk or protective factors, increasing healthcare spending. In this project, we aim to develop iScreen 2 Predict™, an AI- based diagnostic platform for predicting persons at risk of AD in primary and community health care settings.",An AI-assisted screening platform within a multivariate framework for biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease,10252098,R41AG073066,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnostic', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caregivers', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Eye', 'Financial Hardship', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Legal patent', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Optic Nerve', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Quality of life', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Smoking', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visual', 'accurate diagnostics', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical care', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'diagnostic platform', 'diagnostic technologies', 'digital health', 'feasibility testing', 'flexibility', 'health care settings', 'health data', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'intervention program', 'medical complication', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'routine care', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,ISCREEN 2 PREVENT LLC,R41,2021,461215
"Causal and integrative deep learning for Alzheimer's disease genetics Summary  In response to PAR-19-269, “Cognitive Systems Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Genetic and Phenotypic Data”, we propose developing and applying more powerful and robust machine learning methods for causal and integrative analysis, especially deep learning approaches for instrumental variable analysis, to identify causal risk/protective factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the post-GWAS era by leveraging published large-scale GWAS, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and other omic and neuroimaging data. Our main motivation is to ex- tend an emerging and increasingly inﬂuential approach of integrating GWAS with gene expression data, called transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), aiming to improve over the current practice of GWAS by not only increasing statistical power, but also identifying (putative) causal genes, thus gaining insights into the genetic basis of common diseases and complex traits. The statistical principle underlying TWAS is the (two-sample) two-stage least squares (2SLS) for linear models in the framework of instrumental variable (IV) analysis for causal inference. In practice, however, TWAS may fail to identify true causal genes while giving false positives due to the violation of its modeling assumptions, e.g., due to non-linear effects of IVs or gene expression, or due to invalid IVs (in the presence of horizontal pleiotropy of SNPs). First, we propose developing linear models and neural network models incorporating a large number of functional annotations on the genome (e.g. various types of functional genomic and epigenetic data from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects) as prior knowledge to improve im- puting/predicting gene expression (or other molecular or imaging endophenotypes or complex traits/diseases) via SNPs, corresponding to the ﬁrst stage of 2SLS. Second, we propose neural networks as more ﬂexible non-linear models for the second stage of 2SLS in the presence of invalid IVs, which may be the SNPs having direct (or horizontal pleiotropic) effects on the outcome as expected from the wide-spread pleiotropy. Then we combine the approaches in the above two stages to form a more ﬂexible and robust neural network approach as an extension of 2SLS for causal inference. Third, we consider inferring causal directions between two traits, e.g. a gene's expres- sion and AD, allowing non-linear relationships between SNPs and traits and between the two traits. This is critical in reducing false positives, e.g. due to reverse causation, but has been largely under-studied. Fourth, we apply the new (and existing) methods to transcriptomic, proteomic, neuroimaging and AD GWAS/WGS data to identify (pu- tative) causal genes, proteins and brain regions of interest (ROIs) for AD, while building the corresponding genetic prediction models for endophenotypes and AD risk. Finally, we will develop and disseminate publicly available software implementing the proposed analysis methods, e.g. as Python programs or R packages, to facilitate the wide use by the scientiﬁc community. Project Narrative  This proposed research is expected to not only identify novel and (putative) causal genes, proteins and brain re- gions for Alzheimer's disease through integrative post-GWAS data analysis, but also contribute powerful and robust statistical and machine learning methods for causal inference as valuable computational tools for the elucidation of genetic components of common diseases, thus facilitating their prevention, early diagnosis and therapeutic development.",Causal and integrative deep learning for Alzheimer's disease genetics,10267373,U01AG073079,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Motivation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-linear Models', 'Operant Conditioning', 'Outcome', 'Prevention', 'Protein Region', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cognitive system', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drug development', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genetic association', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'modifiable risk', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'response', 'software development', 'statistical and machine learning', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy development', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2021,733352
"Alzheimer's MultiOme Data Repurposing: Artificial Intelligence, Network Medicine, and Therapeutics Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Predisposition to AD involves a complex, polygenic, and pleiotropic genetic architecture; furthermore, there are no disease modifying treatments that slow the neurodegenerative process for AD. Traditional reductionist paradigms overlook the inherent complexity of AD and have often led to treatments that are lack of clinical benefits or fraught with adverse effects. Existing multi-omics data resources, including genetics, genomics, transcriptomics, interactomics (protein-protein interactions and chromatin interactions), have not yet been fully utilized and integrated to explore the pathobiology and drug discovery for AD. Understanding AD genetics and genomics from the point-of-view of how cellular systems and molecular interactome perturbations underlie the disease (termed disease module) is the essence of network medicine. Systematic identification and characterization of novel underlying pathogenesis and disease module, will serve as a foundation for identifying and validating novel risk genes and drug targets in AD. Given our preliminary results, we posit that a genome- wide, multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) framework to identify new risk genes and networks from human genome/exome sequencing and multi-omics findings enable a more complete mechanistic understanding of AD pathogenesis and the rapid development of targeted therapeutic intervention for AD with great success. Aim 1 will determine whether rare coding and non-coding variants by whole-genome/exome sequencing (WGS/WES) are enriched in protein-functional and gene-regulatory regions using sequence and structure-based deep learning models. These analyses will assemble WGS/WES and clinical data from Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), publicly available protein structure (i.e., protein-protein interfaces, protein-ligand binding sites, post-translational modifications) and sequence (expression quantitative trait locus [eQTLs], histone-QTLs, and transcription factor binding-QTLs) information from the PDB database, GTEx, NIH RoadMap, FANTOM5, PsychENCODE, and NIH 4D Nucleome. Aim 2 will determine whether GWAS common variants linked to AD pathobiology and endophenotypes are enriched in gene regulatory networks in a cell-type specific manner using a Bayesian framework. We will validate risk gene and network findings using WGS/WES and protein panel expression data from our existing cohorts: The Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease Biobank (CBH-Biobank) and the Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (CADRC). Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that risk genes and networks can be modulated via in silico drug repurposing, population-based validation, and functional test, to identify candidate agents and drug combinations that will modify AD. The successful completion of this project will offer capable and intelligent computer-based toolboxes that enable searching, sharing, visualizing, querying, and analyzing genetics, genomics, and multi-omics profiling data for genome-informed therapeutic discoveries for AD and other neurodegenerative disease if broadly applied. Project Narrative It is estimated that more than 16 million people with AD live in the United States by 2050 and the predisposition to AD involves a complex, polygenic, and pleiotropic genetic architecture. This proposal will develop intelligent computer-based network medicine and systems biology tools, capable of identifying and validating human genome sequencing findings for novel risk gene discoveries and targeted therapeutic development in AD. The innovative network-based, artificial intelligence toolboxes and novel risk genes and biologically relevant targeted therapeutic approaches developed in this proposal will prove to be novel and effective ways to improve outcomes in long-term brain care for the rapidly growing AD population, an essential goal of AD precision medicine.","Alzheimer's MultiOme Data Repurposing: Artificial Intelligence, Network Medicine, and Therapeutics Discovery",10276964,U01AG073323,"['Adverse effects', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chromatin', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Hi-C', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Intelligence', 'Investments', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Transgenic Mice', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker panel', 'brain health', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'drug repurposing', 'endophenotype', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human genome sequencing', 'improved outcome', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'kernel methods', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neglect', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'protein expression', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'rare variant', 'research and development', 'risk variant', 'single cell analysis', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,U01,2021,796538
"Advancing methods for mapping short-range association fibers in the aging brain PROJECT ABSTRACT White matter (WM) microstructural and connectional alterations are increasingly recognized as sensitive biomarkers of early pathological changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Due to limitations in spatial resolution and diffusion-encoding sensitivity of conventional diffusion MRI techniques, only long-range fiber tracts in deep WM have been accurately mapped and studied in AD. Little is known about the short-range association fibers (SAFs) in superficial WM, even though they contribute to 90% WM connections and are more vulnerable to age-related degeneration than deep WM according to the retrogenesis model of AD. This proposal aims to improve the accuracy and feasibility of SAF mapping using ultra-high-resolution (1 mm isotropic or higher) and high-sensitivity diffusion MRI in AD. Specifically, the candidate will develop an optimal acquisition strategy for in vivo mapping of SAFs, leveraging knowledge learned from histological validation using ex vivo diffusion MRI and polarization- sensitive optical coherence tomography; and employ developed methods to quantitatively determine when, where and how aberrant tissue properties and connections of SAFs occur in AD and how they relate to cognitive and molecular biomarkers in individuals with concurrent MRI and PET, as well as elucidate the role of short- range cortico-cortical connections in the spread of pathological tau proteins in AD. This proposal will advance next-generation diffusion MRI tractography and microstructural imaging at 1 mm isotropic or higher resolution for mapping SAFs and fine-scale structures across the whole brain in AD, clarify the effectiveness of SAFs as biomarkers of early pathological changes in AD, and shed light into the spread of tau through axonal connections.  The candidate’s long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator dedicated to developing cutting-edge neuroimaging methodology, advancing the clinical utilization of these advanced neuroimaging technologies in the diagnosis, characterization and tracking of neurodegenerative diseases, and advancing understanding of the pathological mechanisms that cause dementia. This candidate has in-depth training in state-of-the-art diffusion MRI and tractography, image processing and analysis, and deep learning. During this K award, he will work with a multi-disciplinary team of mentors and collaborators to acquire additional expertise in histological validation, brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases as well as clinical translational research, which are essential for him to implement the proposed research and lead an independent laboratory. The exceptional resources, mentorship and collaboration at the Massachusetts General Hospital Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging and Alzheimer's Disease Research Center will provide an ideal environment for the candidate to achieve both his scientific and career development goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE White matter demyelination and degeneration are important indicators of early Alzheimer’s disease pathology, but the majority of white matter fibers in superficial white matter have been underinvestigated and remain largely unknown, despite their abundance and importance in mediating cortico-cortical connectivity. In this study, we propose to develop, validate and translate next-generation ultra-high resolution diffusion MRI and tractography methods for enabling accurate and efficient mapping of the superficial white matter in Alzheimer’s disease. We will reveal alterations in the microstructural and connectional anatomy of short-range association fibers as more sensitive biomarkers of early pathological changes in AD and elucidate their role in mediating the spread of pathological tau proteins in Alzheimer’s disease.",Advancing methods for mapping short-range association fibers in the aging brain,10284540,K99AG073506,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Choristoma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Connective Tissue', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Distant', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Fiber', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histologic', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Noise', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive development', 'connectome', 'data quality', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'early detection biomarkers', 'entorhinal cortex', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular marker', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'pre-clinical', 'research study', 'skills', 'tau Proteins', 'tractography', 'ultra high resolution', 'uptake', 'white matter']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2021,133920
"Motor Profiles as Novel Biomarker for Alzheimer’s Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Established biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as amyloid beta measured with PET, are expensive and invasive. Cost-efficient, quick, and easy-to-administer motor measures, such as grip strength and walking speed, have shown to precede the cognitive symptoms of AD by several years. Relative to single measures, combining ambulatory and strength measures boosts predictive value for AD. This suggests that a composite motor profile score that weighs functions spanning the breadth of motor domains will have optimal predictive power. Cognitive and motor brain regions that are known to degenerate early (e.g., the hippocampus and fornix) and later in the AD disease process (e.g., the cerebellum, (pre)motor cortex, and corticospinal tract) are candidates for the prediction of motor dysfunction in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. The objective of this K01 proposal is two-fold: 1) to further develop the research skills of the applicant with a series of mentored activities, and 2) to identify the behavioral and neural motor profiles of MCI and AD with the aim of developing a robust and valid risk scoring algorithm. Our central hypothesis is that a motor behavioral composite score and neural motor profile score distinguish individuals with MCI and AD from healthy control subjects, and are related to established AD biomarkers (amyloid burden, hippocampal volume, and APOE e4 status). The project has three specific aims: 1) Quantify behavioral and neural motor dysfunction in MCI and AD; 2) Identify behavioral and neural motor composite scores as novel AD biomarkers; and 3) Replicate a motor composite score as AD biomarker in a large independent sample from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging.  The training plan aims to establish expertise in areas that are crucial for the candidate to conduct the proposed research and to become an independent investigator in the field of AD. The following training goals have been identified in close collaboration with the mentoring team: a) establishing a clinical perspective and the conceptual framework required to implement effective research in MCI and AD; b) develop expertise in machine learning relevant to prediction modeling; c) gaining an in-depth understanding of neurological motor signs and function in MCI and AD; and d) develop expertise on AD biomarkers and their perceived role in AD etiology. The training will be closely supervised by clinical experts of AD (Dr. Duff), and leaders in the field of neural motor dysfunction in aging (Dr. Rosano), AD biomarkers (Dr. Foster), MCI risk factors (Dr. Kremen), and machine learning (Dr. Tasdizen). The candidate's optimal institutional environment further ensures the success of the training and research plan that will provide data for an R01 application on the prediction of MCI to AD transition from a motor profile composite score. The proposed research makes a significant contribution towards the development of novel cost-efficient AD biomarkers that can serve to enrich clinical trials and for diagnostic purposes, consistent with the mission of the NIA. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) often suffer from motor problems such as slowness and loss of strength. Constructing a composite score of multiple motor domains in AD can result in a marker that could be used to indicate the risk to develop the disease. In the proposed study we will use machine learning to identify which motor measures are best used together to create such a composite score, and to define the neural mechanisms that underly motor dysfunction in AD.",Motor Profiles as Novel Biomarker for Alzheimer’s Disease,10283297,K01AG073578,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapy', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrum', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hand Strength', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Studies', 'Vietnam', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vector', 'walking speed', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2021,130140
"Neurobehavioral phenotyping of AD model mice using Motion Sequencing Abstract  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by progressive changes in neural circuits that culminate in memory loss, confusion, difficulty completing tasks, withdrawal, mood changes and ultimately death. Alterations in body movement — such as slowed gait, and difficulty in avoiding obstacles — have been associated with AD, are predictive of AD, and often appear in the pre-clinical stage, before cognitive changes are apparent. These observations raise important questions about how AD targets the cognitive and motor systems that support movement and/or action selection; addressing these questions in turn requires a clear view of how AD pathophysiology influences behavior both early and late in disease, and particularly how these changes in behavior are distinguished from the many motor-related changes apparent during normal aging. However, to date behavioral analysis of movement in AD mouse models have not yet yielded a clear and consistent view of how AD affects the neural circuits responsible for selecting, composing, sequencing and implementing ongoing behaviors. At least in part this failure reflects the methods used to characterize behavior in mouse models, which depend upon a set of reductionist assays that capture limited aspects of a mouse's overall behavioral comportment within a given experiment; as a consequence we do not know whether different AD models share core movement phenotypes, nor do we understand whether or how AD targets the cortico-striatal circuits that create the coherent, moment-to-moment patterns of action used by mice to interact with the world. Our laboratory has recently developed a novel behavioral characterization technique, based upon 3D machine vision and unsupervised machine learning techniques, called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq). MoSeq automatically and without human supervision identifies the behavioral modules (“syllables” e.g., a left turn, the first half of a rear, etc.) out of which spontaneous and self-directed behavior is composed, as well as the statistical rules governing the sequencing of these syllables (“grammar”). We have previously demonstrated that the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) contains explicit neural correlates for both syllables and grammar, and that the DLS is causally required to assemble syllables into meaningful and adaptive sequences. Here we propose to use MoSeq to characterize behavioral phenotypes expressed by a variety of AD mouse models, to perform joint neural-behavioral recordings to probe circuit mechanisms that underlie these observed phenotypes and, finally, to develop MoSeq into a broadly-applicable platform for studying the movement-related signatures of cognition. Taken together, these experiments promise to revitalize the study of behavior and neuro-behavioral relationships in pre-clinical models of AD, and to reveal key mechanisms that tie together AD-related genetic lesions, neural circuit function, and ongoing naturalistic patterns of action. Narrative In Alzheimer's disease (AD), changes in movement often presage cognitive decline; in these proposed experiments, we will characterize behavioral changes in mouse models of AD using advanced machine learning techniques, and ask how AD-related pathophysiological lesions might lead to altered neural codes and therefore changes in movement.",Neurobehavioral phenotyping of AD model mice using Motion Sequencing,10281230,RF1AG073625,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Confusion', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Emotional', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial cost', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Mouse Strains', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'loss of function', 'machine vision', 'mouse model', 'movement analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobehavioral', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'pre-clinical', 'relating to nervous system', 'unsupervised learning']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,RF1,2021,1931938
"Use of machine learning to quantify cognitive function in AD, FTD, and DLB Project Abstract / Summary Cognitive assessment is a key element of the diagnostic evaluation of patients suspected of having early symptomatic stages of neurodegenerative brain diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD), and Lewy Body Disease (LBD). As biomarkers mature, the field is separating clinical syndromes arising from these diseases from the neuropathologic changes themselves, leading to concerns about classification systems for the illnesses these diseases produce. Many tests typically employed in cognitive assessment are verbal, often implemented by an examiner asking the patient a question and the patient answering. These tests are typically scored by hand, with the examiner counting correct or incorrect answers and a simple score being generated against normative scores. Many of the tests still in use were developed 30+ years ago. An exciting array of recent advances in artificial intelligence methods has begun to enable the measurement and classification of language and other cognitive characteristics captured in audio recordings. Here we introduce a new approach to accomplishing both of these possibilities. Recent developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) have now made possible the automated discovery and classification of features measurable in speech samples. Once established, these feature sets can be connected to distributions of cortical atrophy, thus enabling links between specific cognitive abnormalities and underlying neural networks. This approach to the analysis of clinical dementia syndromes can be achieved through a sufficiently large number of cognitive test measures recorded as speech samples. In addition, such analyses require the use of the latest generation of artificial intelligence models, called transformer-networks, to be able to learn the unique ways in which individuals with cognitive impairment or dementia respond to questions requiring memory, executive function, emotion, or language. In Aim 1, we will investigate the validity of an unsupervised artificial intelligence model for measuring cognitive abnormalities in patients with AD, FTLD, or DLB against traditional clinical measures and against MRI measures of regional brain atrophy. In Aim 2, we will investigate the performance of an unsupervised artificial intelligence model for classifying cognitive abnormalities in AD, FTLD, and DLB patients into clusters. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the reliability of these automated measures of cognitive abnormalities in AD, FTLD, and DLB. Through a finer-grained analysis of cognition in people with AD, FTLD, or DLB, it should be possible to develop better understanding of the overlapping and dissociable features of these dementias, aiming for improved diagnostic classification and better monitoring. We will use innovative Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methods to determine whether particular types of cognitive abnormalities, linked to regional MRI- derived cortical atrophy, can delineate overlapping and dissociable features of AD, FTD, and DLB, aimging to improve diagnostic classification and outcomes monitoring.","Use of machine learning to quantify cognitive function in AD, FTD, and DLB",10288487,R21AG073744,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Generations', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Lewy Body Disease', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Psychometrics', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Speech', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'executive function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural network', 'neurodegenerative dementia', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'patient response', 'performance tests', 'phonology', 'prognostic', 'syntax', 'tau Proteins', 'unsupervised learning']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2021,203241
"Uncovering the Heterogeneity of Neurodegeneration Trajectories in Alzheimer's Disease Using a Network Guided Reaction-Diffusion Model Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heterogeneous, multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder. Due to the multiplicity of clinical symptoms, standard neuropsychological assessments inadequately reflect the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, which renders a significant gap between neurobiological examinations of AD pathology and clinical diagnoses. Mounting evidence shows that AD is caused by the build-up of two abnormal proteins, beta-amyloid and tau. Over time, these AD-related neuropathological burdens begin to spread throughout the brain, which results in the characteristic progression of symptoms in AD. Although striking efforts have been made to investigate the neurobiological factors behind the acquisition of amyloid (A), protein tau (T), and neurodegeneration [N] biomarkers, a system-level understanding of how these neuropathological burdens promote neurodegeneration and why AD exhibits characteristic progression is still largely elusive. In this study, we will combine the power of systems biology and network neuroscience to disentangle the heterogeneous trajectories of cognitive decline in AD population by understanding the dynamic interaction and diffusion process of AT[N] biomarkers from an unprecedented amount of longitudinal neuroimaging data. The backbone of this project is our recently developed network guided reaction-diffusion model that characterizes not only the interaction of AT[N] biomarkers at each brain region but also their propagation pattern across the brain networks using PDEs (partial differential equations). Given its promising results in predicting the evolution of AT[N] biomarkers, we will further develop our current PDE-based model by incorporating spatiotemporal-adaptive mechanistic pathways of AT[N] biomarkers. Then, we will investigate the system behaviors that steer the trajectory of cognitive decline in Aim 1. After that, we will develop a novel deep learning approach to stratify aging brains into a set of fine-grained categories (aka. subtypes) with distinct neurobiological underpinnings, where individuals within the same subtype are expected to have very similar trajectories of cognitive decline. We will evaluate the novel population stratification result using the longitudinal imaging data from the ADNI database in Aim 2. The success of this project will allow us to have a new understanding of the neurodegeneration process in the cognitive continuum spectrum. This is an important step because slowing down this spread at an early stage might prevent or halt the symptoms of AD. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to disentangle the heterogeneity of neurodegeneration trajectory in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by understanding the mechanisms of how neuropathological events spread throughout the brain. To that end, we will first refine our network guided reaction-diffusion model to characterize the complex and evolving mechanistic pathways of AT[N] biomarkers and study the resulting system behaviors that govern the trajectory of cognitive decline in Aim 1. Second, we will develop a novel machine learning approach to stratify the aging brains based on the system behaviors and investigate the neuroscientific and clinical underpinnings of the identified subtypes in Aim 2.",Uncovering the Heterogeneity of Neurodegeneration Trajectories in Alzheimer's Disease Using a Network Guided Reaction-Diffusion Model,10288783,R03AG073927,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severities', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'Yang', 'aging brain', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'deep learning', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'insight', 'method development', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'population stratification', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R03,2021,165383
"Stricker Learning Span: A Computer Adaptive Word List Memory Test Optimized for Remote Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Due to COVID-19, remote cognitive assessment has transitioned from an important research aim to an immediate and urgent research and clinical need. This need has underscored the lack of well-validated, sensitive, reliable, and well-normed tests available for remote assessment. Word list memory performance changes early in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), up to 20 years prior to onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Although delayed word list recall is viewed as the most sensitive memory measure in studies of MCI and AD dementia, traditional word list memory test paradigms require interactive administration with an examiner. Further, recency effects may influence the sensitivity of delayed word list recall: correct recall of words at the end of the list during immediate recall trials may represent attentional span/working memory for some individuals. When these words are subsequently not recalled at delay, they are considered forgotten, but an alternate view is that the words were never fully encoded during repeated learning trials. In line with this, the central deficit in AD may be one of learning. To help address the critical need for a sensitive and brief remote learning measure, we have developed a new word list learning paradigm. The Stricker Learning Span (SLS) aims to achieve the known sensitivity of word list memory tests to the earliest preclinical AD changes while allowing reliable remote self-administration on a smartphone or alternative device (e.g., PC, tablet) through a web-based platform. This flexible approach is necessary to reach the most users and eliminate potential health disparities. We have transformed the traditional manner of administering a word list memory test in several important ways, resulting in a novel paradigm that takes full advantage of computer- based administration through use of a computer adaptive testing procedure focused on learning, visual presentation of the word list, 4-choice recognition to assess words learned, and a complete data capture approach to allow future studies focused on process-based measures and application of machine learning techniques. This study will leverage the resources of the ongoing population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, which already incorporates in-clinic and remote computerized cognitive assessment. Specifics aims include to (1) determine the acceptability and efficiency of the unsupervised SLS, (2) demonstrate the construct validity of the SLS by examining association with a traditional word list memory measure, (3) determine the criterion validity of the SLS through sensitivity to preclinical AD (cross-sectional effect sizes between cognitively unimpaired amyloid PET positive and negative groups) and associations with continuous AD neuroimaging biomarkers (tau PET, hippocampal volume) in all participants with neuroimaging data, and (4) determine 7.5 month test-retest reliability for the SLS. Sensitive, remotely administered computerized measures will help to identify individuals with preclinical AD for anti-amyloid and anti-tau clinical trials, as well as individuals meeting criteria for treatment once anti-amyloid or anti-tau therapies are approved. PROJECT NARRATIVE/LAY SUMMARY There is a critical need to develop tools to assess cognitive function remotely for both research and clinical purposes. The Stricker Learning Span is a novel computer adaptive word list memory test that has strong potential to be sensitive to preclinical Alzheimer’s disease, in addition to aging and other neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIA’s mission and will specifically (1) improve our understanding of the aging brain, Alzheimer’s disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases and (2) promote broad use and dissemination of digital technology for early detection and monitoring of cognitive decline in aging, Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementias.",Stricker Learning Span: A Computer Adaptive Word List Memory Test Optimized for Remote Assessment,10295468,R21AG073967,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Amyloid', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'COVID-19', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Distance Learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home', 'Immediate Recalls', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychology', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Self Administration', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specificity', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Work', 'aging brain', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive test', 'response', 'screening', 'tau Proteins', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2021,437250
"Development of a cost-effective and neurobiologically valid VR assessment tool for   early detection of AD PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with significant impact on patients, families and the public health system. At the time of clinical manifestation of dementia, significant irreversible brain damage is already present, rendering the development of cost-effective, biologically informed assessment tools for early detection of the disease an urgent prerequisite for potential therapies to delay or prevent symptoms. While significant advances have been made in characterizing early stages of AD for research, current standard-of-care measures used for clinical diagnosis of prodromal AD lack the ability to identify AD in early stages. The overarching goals of the proposed study are to integrate VR, advanced neuroimaging technologies, and computational techniques to refine, optimize, test and validate a VR-based assessment tool that is cost-effective and ecologically and neurobiologically valid for early detection of AD. Particularly, we will integrate performance on a VR-based multidomain cognitive assessment battery combined with real-time performance data across multiple sources (e.g. kinematic) to identify subtle factors underlying VR task performance that contribute the most to sensitive detection of prodromal AD. Most importantly, using advanced quantitative MR measures of brain microstructure, we will test the association between VR measures and early markers of microstructural changes in brain networks to identify the most biologically valid VR measures of prodromal AD. Our central hypothesis is that VR measures of episodic memory, spatial navigation, and visuospatial skills are most sensitive in detecting prodromal AD, and that these VR measures predict AD- related brain pathology in medial temporal and posterior parietal cortical regions as well as in cingulum and hippocampal white matter fascicles. Our preliminary data using an in-house, novel, multidomain VR assessment battery on a sample of individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and older healthy controls (HC) (N = 23, 17 with aMCI) supported our hypothesis. We propose to refine, optimize, test and validate our suite of VR measures in a larger sample (N = 50 total, 30 aMCI) to accomplish the following Specific Aims: To optimize and test a suite of VR assessments for sensitive detection of prodromal AD (Aim 1) and to test the biological validity of the proposed VR measures in detecting prodromal AD pathology (Aim 2). Successful validation of the proposed VR battery may lead to development of a cost-effective, ecologically and biologically valid assessment tool for early detection of AD. Further, these measures can potentially be used as sensitive behavioral markers for monitoring the response to experimental AD treatments and predicting cognitive and clinical trajectories. PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant microstructural changes occur in the brain years before clinical manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), rendering the urgent need for cost-effective, neurobiologically informed assessments for early AD diagnosis.

"Decoding the impact of sex differences on Alzheimer's disease risk Decoding the Impact of Sex Differences on Alzheimer’s Disease Risk The molecular basis and genetic architecture of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) remain poorly defined. Solving these problems is further complicated by the differences that exist between men and women with respect to the prevalence, onset, progression and comorbidities of AD, suggesting that some contributing genetic variants are sex-specific. So far, mixed-gender Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked over 100 loci with AD. These loci explain much of the population-attributable risk but just a fraction of heritability, and with no distinction between men and women. It is unlikely that this heritability gap would improve just by splitting studies by sex, however, since separate analyses on about half as many patients would be less powerful. Rather, in order to design effective surveillance, screening, preventive, and stratification programs tailored to each sex, there is a critical need for more sensitive and accurate methods, able to compute the link between genetic variants and AD risk separately and specifically in men and women. To do so, we propose an integrative computational approach that will be validated by experimental and translational studies of candidate genes. Rather than seek individual variants, we focus instead on genes and their coding regions. In order to increase the power of our studies, we developed an unbiased evolution-based continuous score for the functional impact of any coding variant, from 0 (neutral) to 1 (complete loss of function). Using this scoring system adds to the usual analyses of human variants a vast number of amino acid mutation experiments already performed by evolution over billions of years, with each mutation being tied to a functional readout based on the context of its phylogenetic divergence. With this score, we now propose to identify genes that carry significantly more impactful coding variants in AD women, or AD men, compared to sex-matched controls. The gain in statistical power of this approach compared to GWAS has been demonstrated in preliminary data. In Aim 1 we propose to discover sex-specific AD genes on more than 1000 Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) men and 1400 ADSP women; and in Aim 2 to discover sex-specific modifiers of APOE. Aim 3 will include validation of computationally-derived candidate genes in human brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and thorough experimental characterization in AD animal-models (mouse and Drosophila). Together, this combination of novel, integrative computational approaches and multi-model systems validation experiments will yield new biomarkers that improve sex-specific risk stratification of AD status and reveal differences in disease mechanisms between women and men that highlight potential therapeutic targets specific to each. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not exactly the same in women and in men, so that in order to design more effective surveillance, screening, preventive, and risk assessment programs, we need new methods that are sensitive and accurate enough to detect differences in how genetic variants are linked to AD risk in women and men. For this we propose a variety of new statistical and machine learning tools that will interpret the variants observed in human genomes from patients in light of the entire history of past evolutionary mutations and adaptations. The best candidate genes we find will then be tested experimentally in AD animal-models (mouse and Drosophila) to yield highly validated sex-specific predictors of AD status that could enable precise risk stratification, provide sex-specific biomarkers, highlight sex-differential disease mechanisms and reveal potential therapeutic targets.",Decoding the impact of sex differences on Alzheimer's disease risk,10300802,R01AG074009,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amino Acids', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Code', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Drosophila genus', 'Evolution', 'Female', 'Freezing', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anillin', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'candidate validation', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'loss of function', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'marginalized population', 'men', 'mouse model', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protective effect', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'robot assistance', 'screening', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistical and machine learning', 'stem', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,1201822
"Digital biomarker for a low cost ambulatory test for early detection of Alzheimer's disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Presently, no established biomarker exists to robustly predict the clinical manifestation of cognitive symptoms in persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias. PET and MRI brain biomarkers are costly and invasive, thus there is a critical need for a noninvasive, inexpensive, and portable AD screening tool that can be easily deployed in-home or in residential communities. While non-brain signals characterizing biological and behavioral traits may prove valuable, two types of brain signal also hold strong promise as digital biomarkers of early stages of AD: epileptogenic activity (EA), and aberrant functional brain networks. Importantly, both biomarkers can be collected affordably and reliably with the latest dry-electrode ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) technology. AD patients have a tenfold higher seizure prevalence compared to the general population (Pandis and Scarmeas, 2012); however, the use of EA as an AD digital biomarker is largely unexplored. It is also well known that amnestic MCI (aMCI) and AD patients show subtle functional network disruptions that are promising predictors of AD, as shown by our group (e.g Pusil et al., 2019) and others, but there is no previous research assessing the joint impact between EA and functional networks. The scientific premise of this proposal is two-fold: (i) a combinatorial EA and functional network biomarker will predict conversion from aMCI to AD more robustly than a single signal in isolation, and (ii) a novel deep learning model that performs multimodal (MEG and EEG) learning to find shared signatures of AD, but ultimately yields a model that needs affordable EEG-only data, will yield a powerful biomarker. This proposal will pursue three specific aims. 1) Identify specific features of EA that prognosticate aMCI conversion; 2) Design a digital biomarker that predicts aMCI conversion from EA features and functional brain networks; 3) Extend the digital biomarker to ambulatory EEG with dry electrode technology. To achieve these aims, we will collect MEG, wet-electrode EEG, and dry-electrode (ambulatory) EEG data from 200 aMCI patients, evaluate their signals with expert epileptologists, and monitor the patient’s yearly conversion rate to AD. We will then design and validate a deep learning model called Siamese Multiple Graph to Gauss (SMG2G), which performs multimodal learning on MEG and EEG network (graph) data but ultimately yields a model that needs EEG-only data to make predictions of aMCI conversion. The final product will be a dry-electrode ambulatory EEG digital biomarker that can be readily measured in home or in a residential facility. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it is the first to combine EA and functional network signals to design an AD biomarker and achieves this by cutting- edge machine learning. It is also significant because it will advance the field vertically both scientifically and clinically by enabling large-scale, early detection of AD. Our team is especially well-prepared to undertake this project, with clinical and engineering expertise, strong collaboration over the years, with preliminary data supporting the aims, and institutional support. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it develops a new biomarker to predict early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using machine learning technology applied to cutting-edge dry-electrode ambulatory electroencephalography data. Prediction will rely on the development and validation of a state-of- the-art system that combines epileptogenic activity and functional brain networks. Once such a biomarker has been developed, this will provide the basis for a noninvasive, inexpensive, and portable AD screening tool that can be easily deployed in-home or in residential communities.",Digital biomarker for a low cost ambulatory test for early detection of Alzheimer's disease,10301875,RF1AG074204,"['Address', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer disease screening', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Sciences', 'Home', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residential Facilities', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'portability', 'predictive marker', 'prodromal Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'prospective', 'real world application', 'tool', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,RF1,2021,2050969
"Drug Discovery for Alzheimer’s Disease Enabled by Multi-Omics and Artificial Intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how amyloid beta oligomers (AβO) induce neurotoxicity and neuron death in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as evidenced by a dearth of therapies to prevent or halt AD progression. Continued existence of this knowledge gap represents a major issue for public health and the mission of the NIH because, until it is filled, development of treatments for neurodegeneration in AD will remain largely intractable. The long-term goal of this work is to discover pathways that enable resistance to AβO- induced neurotoxicity thereby allowing discovery of new AD therapeutics. The overall objective here, which is the next step in pursuit of this goal, is to build AI that accurately predicts the ability of drug candidates to cure or prevent toxicity of AβO in human stem cell-derived cortical glutamatergic neurons. To train this AI, a library of proteomic and metabolomic (hereafter referred to as multi-omic) phenotypes will be generated from neurons that are: 1) healthy, 2) AβO-treated (AD-like), or 3) drug library+AβO-treated. The central hypothesis is that some drugs at least partially palliate AβO-induced neurotoxicity, which is observable as a shift in multi-omic state toward the healthy state, and that AI can learn to predict this curative potential from drug structures. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data generated by the applicant and literature. The rationale for the proposed research is that mapping the difference in multi-omic phenotypes of healthy and AβO-stressed neurons, and mapping how chemical structures induce changes between those states, will allow AI to learn to make accurate predictions of whether additional, unmeasured molecules can improve neuron health. This will result in new and innovative approaches for prevention and treatment of AD. Guided by preliminary data and literature, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) validate the multi-omic phenotype landscape of healthy and AD-like neurons; and 2) build AI to discover new drugs that prevent AβO-induced neuron death in AD. The first aim will validate the human disease relevance of our model system using cell- based assays and by comparing omic profiles from our system to those observed in human AD brains. The second aim will build a map of how drugs candidates alter neural multi-omic states to use for training predictive AI. Completion of these aims will contribute (1) an in vitro system that mimics physiological milieu, and also (2) molecular ‘omics’ signatures of those healthy and AD-like human iPSC-derived neural cells, which are two areas of high program relevance defined in NOT-AG-19-007. This approach is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it departs from the status quo by using highly translatable human iPSC-derived neurons for unbiased discovery of palliative drug candidates using a unique combination of multi-omics and AI. This contribution will be significant because it is expected to vertically advance our understanding of basic neuron stress resistance, as well as result in the first drugs that prevent AβO neural toxicity. Ultimately, such knowledge will be useful for other neurodegenerative disorders of aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of new neural resilience mechanisms is ultimately expected to result in new therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease. This project also produces molecular omics profiles from human iPSC-derived neurons, which will serve as a resource for Alzheimer’s disease researchers.

"Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization Consortium Abstract In response to PAR-20-099 “Harmonization of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (AD/RD) Genetic, Epidemiologic, and Clinical Data to Enhance Therapeutic Target Discovery”, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team that includes experts in neuroimaging, neuropsychology, fluid biomarkers, neuropathology, and vascular contributions to ADRD to work in close partnership with the NIH and the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). Our ADSP Phenotype Harmonization Consortium, or “ADSP-PHC”, seeks to work in coordination with existing ADSP workgroups and initiatives to (1) streamline access to endophenotype data, (2) provide high quality endophenotype harmonization across multiple research domains, and (3) provide comprehensive documentation of both data availability and harmonization procedures. This project includes two coordinating centers, three cores, and eight domain- specific harmonization teams led by world-renowned experts in their fields. While our efforts will focus on data access, documentation, and harmonization, we will work closely with other ADSP workgroups and other large-scale harmonization efforts to maximize the impact and align with NIH priorities. In particular, we will focus harmonization on ADRD-related endophenotypes, including cognitive scores derived from detailed neuropsychological assessments, measures of neuropathology measured both ex vivo (neuropathological assessment at autopsy) and in vivo (fluid biomarkers and positron emission tomography biomarkers), concomitant pathways of injury (vascular risk factors and vascular brain injury), and measures of neurodegeneration focusing on both white (diffusion-weighted MRI) and grey matter (T1-weighted MRI). The proposed harmonization effort will provide an unprecedented opportunity to disentangle the genetic architecture of individual biological contributors to ADRD risk and progression. The harmonized data, protocols, and educational tools developed by the ADSP-PHC will transform the ADRD landscape, accelerate discovery, and facilitate the application of emerging big data analytic approaches leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence. NARRATIVE The growing availability of endophenotypic data in cohort studies of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) provides an exciting opportunity to further characterize the genetic architecture of this devastating disease. However, there is a pressing need to develop and apply advanced harmonization approaches to align AD-related endophenotypes across cohorts. The goal of this coordinated national initiative – the AD Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization Consortium, or “ADSP-PHC” - is to provide a centralized database of robust endophenotypes for large-scale genomic analyses that will accelerate the identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention in AD.",Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization Consortium,10332468,U24AG074855,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloidosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Trauma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Letters', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Movement', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'case control', 'central database', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'data access', 'data dissemination', 'data harmonization', 'data repository', 'dementia risk', 'endophenotype', 'epidemiologic data', 'genetic architecture', 'gray matter', 'in vivo', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'online tutorial', 'resilience', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vascular contributions', 'vascular risk factor', 'web portal']",NIA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U24,2021,6835050
"Exploring mechanisms driving microbe-induced AD risk using next generation sequence data. Multiple lines of evidence suggest microbial infections are risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides possess antimicrobial activity and may protect against human herpes viruses (HHV). Viral DNA is also detectable in Aβ plaques, and HHV DNA detected in next generation sequencing (NGS) experiments is associated with AD risk. Although neuroinflammation is the mechanism assumed to drive this association, several questions remain. Foremost, it is unclear whether infections precede AD or are the result of an aging immune system or AD pathology itself. The specific aspects of AD pathology that are affected by infections are also unknown, as is the role of the host genome in mediating risk. The objective of this project is to answer these questions by leveraging large AD cohorts with NGS data derived from blood and brain samples to detect the presence of microbial DNA. Microbial DNA can be detected and quantified in human NGS experiments by aligning reads that do not map to the human genome to microbial reference genomes, and depending on the species identified, may be evidence of either an active or latent infection. Any microbe for which a reference genome is available can be detected. The cohorts include the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD), and Gwangju Alzheimer's & Related Dementias project (GARD). The long-term goal of this project is to provide evidence that interventions targeting microbial infections could prevent AD or slow its progression. Our central hypothesis is that infections increase AD risk and cause observable changes to specific facets of AD pathology. We also hypothesize that variants in the human genome mediate these processes. We will test these hypotheses through the following specific aims. In Aim1, we will develop a pipeline to accurately quantify and match DNA fragments generated by next generation sequencing to microbial DNA sequences, including inserted viral DNA. In Aim2, we will leverage longitudinally followed cohorts with multi-omics data to establish a temporal relationship between infection and AD, and test for associations between microbial DNA and AD-related traits, including biomarkers, structural brain changes measured by magnetic resonance imaging, neuropathological traits, disease progression, brain cell type sub-fractions, and cognitive function. In Aim3, we explore the role of the host genome in mediating microbe induced AD pathology, including testing for associations between SNPs and microbes, and for interactions between known AD risk variants/HLA serotypes and microbial DNA to predict AD. This project is significant because it could provide evidence that preventing or treating infections could treat or prevent AD. The project is innovative because it will be the first to leverage very large AD NGS cohorts, in many of which the tissue used for DNA sequencing was collected prior to AD diagnosis, and use case-only analysis to link microbial DNA to specific aspects of AD pathology. Microbial infections are likely risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Evidence of infections can be found by aligning DNA fragments from samples collected in humans to microbial reference genomes. This project will leverage large, existing next generation sequencing cohorts of AD cases in controls to explore mechanisms driving microbe-mediated AD risk, including the role of variants in the human genome.",Exploring mechanisms driving microbe-induced AD risk using next generation sequence data.,10381136,R01AG076002,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Herpesviridae', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Link', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Other Genetics', 'PLCG2 gene', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SPI1 gene', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Serotyping', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TREM2 gene', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'acute infection', 'antimicrobial', 'antimicrobial drug', 'brain cell', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chronic infection', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'human DNA', 'human tissue', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'latent infection', 'microbial', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'next generation sequence data', 'next generation sequencing', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'reference genome', 'risk variant', 'trait', 'viral DNA']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,335749
"LifeBio-ALZ: AI driven digital biomarker engine leveraging natural conversation to widely scale accessibility for early detection and assessment of Alzheimers disease progression Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia to occur in elderly populations, affecting over 30 million individuals worldwide. As the U.S. elderly population continues to increase, AD incidence rises as well, as there is no neuroprotective therapy or cure. Common symptoms include memory loss, cognitive impairment, disorientation, and psychiatric issues. Traditionally, diagnosis is achieved through a combination of clinical criteria such as neurological examination, mental status tests & brain imaging. However, these strategies are challenging for detection of early AD or patients with mild symptoms, specifically during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. Mental status tests & subjective journals, kept by patients or caregivers, can track AD progression, but have low sensitivity and reliability. The most strongly established biomarkers for AD, including amyloid beta, tau protein, & phosphorylated tau, are all obtained thru CSF requiring invasive lumbar puncture.  The LifeBio-ALZ technology will provide a convenient and accessible, yet comprehensive digital biomarker and analytics suite to detect & assess Alzheimer’s progression. The platform will integrate a suite of assessment domains all seamlessly captured through a single, patient-centric app that engages users in natural video chat conversation via smart digital assistant. During brief, but regular sessions, an individual answers questions following a smart sequence to evaluate awareness, engagement, cognition, reaction time, speech patterns, & emotional state. The platform will record audio/video during the conversation. Type and timing of assessments, as well as specific questions will be adaptively modulated based on AD stage, personal demographics and previous analytics to minimize user burden while still providing rich data for algorithms. Quantitative features across multiple domains will be extracted from digital speech and eye movements, and then used as inputs to an AI engine to detect and assess Alzheimer’s’ disease progression. Data will be aggregated in secure cloud storage with clinician access to dashboard visualization tools.  Phase I will demonstrate core feasibility. Development will build on a strong tech foundation of an existing LifeBio platform to increase likelihood of success. Currently, LifeBio is deployed in several formats including web, phone, & mobile apps to record life histories of people reaching advanced age or facing life-threatening illnesses or memory loss. Natural language processing tools parse information into life stories shared by family or used by staff to personalize engagement in care facilities. While the existing tech provides a base, significant enhancements will be executed in Phase I. More specifically, Phase I tasks will first update platform architecture to integrate novel data domains, build on smart sequenced multidimensional questions, and enhance patient workflow interfaces. Once the enhanced app passes all technical verification testing, it will be deployed in a field data collection and usability study with wide ranging AD patient demographics and stages. Finally, collected data will be used to build and validate an AI engine for detection and assessment of Alzheimer’s progression. The Phase I objective is to design, develop and demonstrate feasibility of LifeBio-ALZ, an artificial intelligence (AI) driven, digital biomarker engine leveraging natural conversation to widely scale accessibility for early detection and assessment of Alzheimer’s disease progression. Current biomarkers for early prediction of Alzheimer’s include cerebral spinal fluid, circulatory biomarkers, blood based amyloid markers, inflammatory markers, & oxidative stress; which are expensive, time-consuming, & invasive. Therefore, a low-cost, patient- centered, & scalable tool with suite of digital biomarkers processed from natural conversation would have a significant impact on healthcare outcomes and costs.",LifeBio-ALZ: AI driven digital biomarker engine leveraging natural conversation to widely scale accessibility for early detection and assessment of Alzheimers disease progression,10381308,R43AG076341,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease test', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disorientation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Journals', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Memory Loss', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Price', 'Process', 'Reaction Time', 'Research Personnel', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Update', 'Videoconferencing', 'Visualization software', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'cloud storage', 'common symptom', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'demographics', 'design', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'improved outcome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'intelligent personal assistant', 'language processing', 'life history', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'person centered', 'personalized strategies', 'prototype', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,LIFEBIO INC,R43,2021,448462
"Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate is an epileptologist and neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School, whose long-term career goal is to become an independent- ly funded translational investigator with expertise at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and patients with epilepsy often suffer from cognitive co-morbidities. The ability to translate the clinical experience, research tools, and intellectual framework from the field of epilepsy to that of the neurodegenerative diseases, and vice versa, could be a powerful approach to studying both processes. During the proposed training period, the candidate will combine her prior training in epilepsy, EEG signal processing, and machine learning, with newly acquired skills in neuroimaging (functional MRI), biostatistics, and additional clinical exposure to patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Under the mentorship of Dr. Sydney Cash, an expert in epilepsy and neurophysiologic signal processing, and the co-mentorship of Dr. Reisa Sperling, an expert in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and neuroimaging approaches, the candidate proposes to: 1) Delineate the spectrum of epileptiform activity in early stages of AD and develop computa- tional tools to identify this activity; 2) Establish the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie epileptiform activity in AD; and 3) Determine how epileptiform abnormalities are associated with cognitive trajectories in patients with early stage AD. Visual and computational analysis of 24- hour scalp EEGs will be integrated with resting-state and task-based fMRI measurements, amy- loid PET imaging, and longitudinal cognitive testing from subjects with AD, to develop a com- prehensive understanding of the role of epileptiform abnormalities in early stages of AD. In addi- tion to the research proposed, the candidate’s career development plan entails rigorous coursework and seminars, practical hands-on experience, and close guidance from a board of academic advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow the candidate to establish a clinical and research niche at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases, and to develop a comprehensive toolbox with which to probe human brain function from the standpoint of neurophysiology, structure, connectivity, and tar- geted pathology. Collectively, these will form the foundation for a successful career as an inde- pendent investigator pursuing important clinical and translational research projects to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, or both. Project Narrative People with Alzheimer’s disease are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and people with epilepsy commonly suffer from impairments in memory and cognition. Our goals are to better understand the interplay between epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, and to determine whether epileptiform activity may be a treatable contributor to cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease. This has important public health implications, as according to the Alzheimer’s Association, a treatment that slows the rate of progression of Alzheimer’s disease by five-fold would reduce the number of people with severe Alzheimer’s disease from 6.5 million to 1.2 million and reduce Medicare costs by 50% by the year 2050.",Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease,10130638,K23NS101037,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperactivity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Technical Expertise', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Visual', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,200880
"Examine the risk of Alzheimer's disease in sexual and gender minorities ABSTRACT Although there is an increasing amount of research on the unique health issues that sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals face, prior studies on SGM health are still limited and have primarily focused on mental health, substance use and abuse, and sexual transmitted infections and diseases. In particular, few SGM studies have examined age-related chronic conditions such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the 2nd and 6th leading causes of death for Americans, respectively. Despite both being associated with aging, cancer and AD do not often occur together; nevertheless, they share a number of common risk factors such as obesity, especially social & behavioral determinants of health (SDoH & BDoH) that are more prevalent among SGMs. Considering that SGMs have different health risk profiles compared to non-SGMs, it is crucial that we examine how these two groups differ in cancer and AD risks and the associated risk factors for early prevention and better clinical prognostication. The proliferation of large clinical research networks (CRNs) of real-world data (RWD) including electronic health records (EHRs), claims, and billing data among others, offer unique opportunities to generate real-world evidence (RWE) that will have direct translational impacts on cancer and AD prevention and care in SGM populations.  In our parent award R21 CA245858-01A1, we proposed to: (1) develop computable phenotype (CP) algorithms to identify transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals (a subgroup of SGM) using RWD from OneFlorida—a large clinical data network covering 15 millions of Floridians as well as develop a NLP pipeline to extract cancer-related risk factors, and (2) conduct a population-based cohort analysis to estimate and compare cancer incidence and cancer risk factors between TGNC and non-TGNC individuals.  In this administrative supplement, we propose to (1) extend the TGNC CP to include sexual orientations (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual among others), and (2) conduct a retrospective study to examine whether SGMs and non-SGMs differ in cancer and AD risk, separately. Our aims are to: (1) develop phenotyping algorithms to accurately identify SGM individuals and extract risk factors associated with cancer and AD, leveraging both structured and unstructured EHR data; and (2) estimate and compare the cancer and AD incidences and risk factors in SGM versus non-SGM individuals. This admin supplement will (1) fill a gap as no population-based studies on SGMs’ cancer and AD risks exist; (2) create a large SGM cohort that can be tracked longitudinally by virtue of routine care, and (3) fill a critical gap in our understanding of SGMs’ risks and risk factors at the intersection of cancer and AD—setting the stage for our future studies on identifying the appropriate prevention strategies intersecting cancer and AD (e.g., whether certain cancer screening is adequate for SGMs with early signs of cognitive impairment and a high-risk of AD). PROJECT NARRATIVE Our project will fill an important gap in our knowledge of Alzheimer’s’ disease (AD) and cancer burden and their risk factors in sexual and gender minority (SGM) people. Computable phenotypes that can accurately identify SGM cohorts in large networks of electronic health records (EHRs) enables us to monitor SGM health longitudinally, which is significant for aging-related diseases such as AD and cancer.
