"Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens Project Summary  Characterizing the functions of protein-coding genes is an important goal in the post-genomic era. While proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions, including those mis-regulated in disease, we have an extremely limited understanding of the roles of the majority of proteins in the human proteome. Though powerful, existing technologies for the high-throughput interrogation of protein-coding genes, including CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches and RNA interference, require extended periods of time to effect changes in protein levels, and thus suffer two critical shortcomings. First, they are unable to detect the contribution of growth- essential genes to any cellular process other than viability, as any cell carrying a perturbation in such a gene would fail to propagate. Second, compensatory and adaptive effects have ample opportunity to manifest, thus convoluting screen results by ameliorating the effect of the perturbation, or by generating a novel, unrelated effect. To address these critical limitations, I propose to develop a new screening technology that will minimize the time between perturbation and screen readout by inducibly and rapidly degrading endogenous proteins. This is made possible by a readily scalable endogenous tagging technology that harnesses homology-independent targeted integration to insert a synthetic exon into the intron of a protein-coding gene at the site of a double strand break. The synthetic exon will encode a multifunctional ligand-binding protein that depending on the ligand, will lead to fluorescence or rapid degradation. Pooled libraries of sgRNAs targeting different introns allows for the creation of custom libraries of cells, where each cell carries this multifunctional tag on a different protein. The utility of this approach will be established aims 1 and 2 by testing (1) whether cells that have undergone rapid depletion of growth-essential proteins are maintained in the cell library at the end of the short perturbation window and (2) whether rapid depletion and CRISPR knockout at the same protein produce different effects on a well-established phenotype, due to the distorting effects of adaptation events in the knockout. Aim 3 witnesses the use of a machine learning approach and the data from thousands of attempted tagging events to identify how the features of a potential tag site dictate the likelihood that a functional protein carrying the multifunctional tag will be produced. The resulting model will be unleashed on the protein-coding genome to predict high-quality tag sites for as many protein-coding genes as possible. This will establish an improved screening paradigm that will allow for the pooled interrogation of the contributions of thousands of proteins to a phenotype of interest, will thus accelerate the rate at which we come to understand the poorly understood elements of the protein-coding genome. These efforts will be well supported by the outstanding resources for experimentation and mentorship at both the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and will provide excellent training in experimental techniques for protein perturbation and characterization, as well computational literacy in the broadly useful field of machine learning. Project Narrative  Proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions in health and disease. Yet, the functions of the majority proteins encoded by the human genome are very poorly understood. A novel high-throughput screening strategy leveraging rapid protein degradation will dramatically accelerate functional characterization of the human proteome.",Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens,10268980,F31HG011185,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell division', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA lesion', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Inclusion Bodies', 'Introns', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Screening Result', 'Shunt Device', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'base', 'blind', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'knockout gene', 'literacy', 'mutant', 'novel', 'protein degradation', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,33463
"Access to Genetic Information Leveraging Innovative Technology (AGILITY) Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The AGILITY (Access to Genetic Information Leveraging Innovative TechnologY) trial will assess layered challenges in realizing precision medicine. This includes a limited genetic counseling workforce to facilitate test decisions, and existing inequities in access to genetic testing. To address these challenges, we will conduct a Type1 Hybrid Trial that includes three specific aims. The first aim is to take an existing clinical genetics chatbot and tailor it for use in population screening of gene variants that can lead to Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer syndromes, Lynch Syndrome, and Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Due to the prevalence of the variants and options for taking actions to reduce negative outcomes, 10 genes have been endorsed for population screening by the National Academy of Medicine and the American College of Medical Genetics. To validate the chatbot for the target population, we will use data from interviews with primary care patients and providers to learn the informational needs to achieve informed test decisions. Once the chatbot is validated, the second aim is to conduct a virtually-implemented randomized controlled trial with primary care patients from a variety of backgrounds. We will test non-inferiority of the chatbot in comparison to standard genetic counseling. We plan to enroll 2,400 adult participants from five racially, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse primary care clinics at the University of Florida Health System. Patients will be eligible to enroll in the trial if they have no higher risks for the screening conditions. [Those with higher risks will be offered the opportunity to undergo targeted genetic testing as is standard of care, and followed as a descriptive study arm.] Participants will be randomized to learn about testing via a clinical chatbot or a genetic counselor. Our primary outcome is informed choice about undergoing genetic testing. As such, those who decline testing are as informative as those who accept. Secondary outcomes include test-related distress, decisional conflict, and testing uptake. Informed choice will be assessed immediately following the decision, after receipt of results for those who accept testing, and 3 and 6 months later for all participants. To ensure success of the AGILITY Trial, investigators at RTI International will work with the Senior Associate Dean of Research, primary care providers, patients and the community advisory board at the University of Florida Health System to develop recruitment, engagement, and retention strategies. The third aim is to conduct an implementation assessment of the clinical chatbot as an intervention to optimize genetic counseling without compromising informed decision-making and to facilitate population screening. To do so, we will analyze interviews with participants, genetic counselors, and primary care providers participating in the trial, using recognized approaches to inform implementation. The AGILITY study will provide evidence in support of workable solutions to address the critical issue of how to provide robust and scalable genetic counseling around predictive genomics in routine clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE More efficient ways for people to make decisions about having genetic testing are needed. We will compare use of a chatbot to standard genetic counseling in helping healthy adults in a primary care setting make informed choices. If similar, this intervention can expand access to genetic testing to achieve greater equity.",Access to Genetic Information Leveraging Innovative Technology (AGILITY) Study,10292565,R01HG011926,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Distress', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Florida', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome', 'Hereditary Malignant Neoplasm', 'Hereditary Neoplastic Syndromes', 'Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Regrets', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Sum', 'Target Populations', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'clinical care', 'comparative efficacy', 'computer program', 'cost', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'genetic counselor', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genomic predictors', 'hereditary risk', 'high risk', 'hybrid type 1 trial', 'implementation outcomes', 'implementation science', 'information technology workforce', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'primary care setting', 'primary outcome', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'service delivery', 'socioeconomics', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'success', 'testing uptake', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'usability', 'virtual']",NHGRI,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2021,331274
"Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum. Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps to potentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—the practice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis for prognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time- intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition, as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play an important role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that can incorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterize colorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer. To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method that can accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. The proposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for each colorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps on whole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visual histology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information from medical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment. The proposed image analysis and prediction methods in this project are based on a novel deep-learning methodology and rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and analysis. The technology developed in this proposal will be rigorously validated on data from patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening at the investigators’ academic medical center and on the records from the New Hampshire statewide colonoscopy data registry. Upon successful completion of this project, the proposed bioinformatics approach is expected to reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. As a result, this project can have a significant, positive impact on improving the efficacy of colorectal cancer screening programs, precision medicine, and public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States; however, it can be prevented through regular screening. The proposed project is expected to reduce the manual burden and potential errors of diagnosis, risk assessment, and follow-up recommendations in colorectal cancer screening. Therefore, the outcomes of this project can potentially reduce screening time and costs, eliminate undue stress to patients, increase the coverage and accuracy of screening programs, and overall reduce colorectal cancer mortality.",Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records,10085670,R01LM012837,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'New Hampshire', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Polyps', 'Prognosis', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive load', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diagnostic technologies', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'histopathological examination', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program', 'translational impact', 'tv watching', 'whole slide imaging']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,356700
"Abramson Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer is the 4th most common cancer diagnosed and the 2nd most common cause of cancer death in the United States. The age-adjusted incidence of CRC in Philadelphia County – a persistently high poverty area– is nearly 25% above the national average. Guideline-based screening for CRC via colonoscopy or fecal immunohistochemistry (FIT) reduces CRC-associated mortality. Despite the proven benefit of regular colonoscopy, CRC screening completion rates remain only around 50% in Philadelphia County and are consistently 10-15% lower for African-Americans than White individuals living in Philadelphia County. Adverse social determinants of health such as high poverty contribute to CRC screening nonadherence disproportionately for African-American and other minority communities. Recognizing this, in 2011, Penn Medicine created a navigation program to increase access to screening colonoscopies for patients in underserved areas of West, South, and Southwest Philadelphia by providing services that reduce barriers to cancer screening, including transportation assistance and detailed instructions on bowel prep. Despite initial success in increasing colonoscopies, a key challenge in scaling this navigation program is identifying patient populations at increased risk of CRC, who may benefit most from timely navigation. Automated machine learning (ML) algorithms based on routine electronic health record (EHR) data accurately estimate a patient’s relative risk of CRC. High-risk individuals may be particularly motivated to comply with disease screening recommendations and be targeted with an effective but resource-constrained navigator program. The overarching goals of this Administrative Supplement is to support the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) mission to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening completion among high-risk individuals living in a persistent poverty county by designing, conducting, disseminating and evaluating an electronic health record- based automated identification program to target effective, culturally-sensitive CRC screening navigation to individuals who have not completed an ordered colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Specifically, the goals of this supplement are to: 1) Adapt a previously validated EHR-based machine learning algorithm to predict CRC detection by retraining the model using data from patients seen in primary care clinics serving zip codes with a high proportion of racial and ethnic minorities living in Philadelphia County, a persistent poverty county; and 2) Implement and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of an algorithm-based CRC navigation program to increase colorectal cancer screening among 344 patients seen at one of 7 primary care practices within Philadelphia county who are at high risk of CRC, have uncompleted colonoscopies. Together, these projects aim to increase evidence-based screening in order to reduce the burden of CRC among high-risk individuals living in a persistent poverty county by utilizing evidence-based, targeted, culturally-sensitive CRC screening navigation that in part addresses social factors that prevent colorectal cancer screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because we aim to target an effective colorectal cancer screening initiative towards patients at risk for colorectal cancer who live in areas with persistent poverty, thus increasing guideline-based colorectal cancer screening for a high-risk population through targeted interventions to address social and clinical barriers to screening completion. This research proposal will optimize an automated machine learning algorithm to predict colorectal cancer risk using electronic health record data and an evidence-based navigation program to address poor colorectal cancer screening rates and increase access to screening colonoscopies for patients in underserved areas of West, South, and Southwest Philadelphia by providing services including transportation assistance, detailed instructions on bowel preparation, or mailed fecal immunochemistry tests. The project is relevant to the NCI’s mission by generating fundamental knowledge to inform clinicians, researchers, and policymakers about effective methods to utilize automated electronic health record interventions to increase the frequency and yield of guideline-based cancer screening in order to improve cancer associated outcomes among communities with high and persistent poverty.",Abramson Cancer Center Support Grant,10408409,P30CA016520,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Center Support Grant', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'County', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family Practice', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hispanics', 'Immunochemistry', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Philadelphia', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Preparation', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'United States', 'Universities', 'adenoma', 'adherence rate', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'colon cancer screening', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community living', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'feasibility testing', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'social', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'transportation access', 'underserved area', 'usability']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2021,200000
"Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications Low prevalence searches form an important and problematic class of visual search tasks. These are tasks where the search target is rare. Many socially important tasks like airport security or cancer screening are low prevalence tasks. Previous work, much of it from our lab, has shown that low prevalence can have undesirable effects. Most notably, miss (false negative) errors are markedly elevated at low prevalence. This is a clear problem if the purpose of the search is to detect something rare but important like cancer or a terrorist threat. Our previous work has documented this pattern of increased miss errors in a number of expert domains including cytology (cervical cancer screening), airport baggage screening, and breast cancer screening. False alarm (false positive) error rates typically decline at low prevalence, moving in the opposite direction from miss errors. This indicates a shift in the observer’s decision criterion. At low prevalence, observers become more reluctant to call something a target. Several studies – ours and others - have shown that this “conservative” criterion shift is not adequate to explain the entire prevalence effect. Wolfe and VanWert (2010) developed a “Dual- Threshold” model that better captures the important aspects of the prevalence effect data by proposing two effects of low prevalence: (1) the conservative shift in the criterion for deciding if an attended item is a target, and (2) a lowering of the “quitting threshold.” The quitting threshold determines when observers end a search. Quitting too soon also increases the chance that the observer will miss a target. Prevalence effects have been studied in experimental isolation from other aspects of search. However, in tasks like breast cancer screening, other factors interact with prevalence. The four projects in the present proposal each investigate one of these interactions. Project 1 examines the relationship of prevalence to the “vigilance decrements” that are seen as time elapses in a task. In search, observers must maintain an internal, mental representation of the search target (or targets). Project 2 is concerned with the impact of prevalence on these “target templates”. Advances in artificial intelligence (notably deep learning) are producing tools to assist expert searchers. However, once deployed, these AI tools have been less effective than theory predicts. Project 3 tests the hypothesis that part of the problem is another side-effect of low prevalence and the project tests a potential intervention. Finally, clinicians, searching for one type of target (e.g. pneumonia) are supposed to report signs of other possible problems (e.g. lung cancer). Project 4 probes the role of prevalence in the failure to report such “incidental findings”. Again, we test several interventions. This is “use-inspired, basic research” whose results will provide guidance for experts performing socially important low prevalence tasks. Important tasks like breast cancer screening involve visual search for rare (“low prevalence”)  targets but, unfortunately, low prevalence is known to increase the percentage of targets that are  missed even by well-trained experts. In a task like breast cancer screening, prevalence interacts  with other factors like observer vigilance or the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tool.  This proposal studies four of these interactions with the goal of counteracting the malign effects  of prevalence; thus making it possible for experts to perform their critical search tasks more  effectively.",Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications,10111519,R01EY017001,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Collaborations', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Flecks', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incidental Findings', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Low Prevalence', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Security', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'mental representation', 'programs', 'side effect', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'vigilance', 'visual search']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,441020
"Aspiration in Acute Respiratory Failure Survivors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Each year more than 700,000 patients survive an episode of acute respiratory failure (ARF) that required endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation. Occurring in as many as 44% of these ARF survivors, post-extubation aspiration is associated with deleterious consequences including pneumonia, percutaneous feeding tube placement, long term care facility admission, and increased hospital mortality. Nevertheless, the complications of aspiration must be weighed against the consequences of inappropriately delaying the resumption of oral feeding. Delayed resumption of oral nutrition is associated with prolonged enteral tube feeding, increased caregiver burden, patient dissatisfaction, and increased health-related costs. With the support of an NINR R21 award, our multidisciplinary and multicenter team discovered three novel findings: 1) we developed a 5-item screening decision tree algorithm that detects patients at high risk for post-extubation aspiration; 2) we identified certain unique upper airway abnormalities that are associated with post-extubation aspiration and dysphagia; and 3) the size of the endotracheal tube (ETT) is independently associated with post-extubation aspiration. This proposal will continue to utilize our robust and established multi-center research group at Colorado, Boston University, Stanford, and Yale; all of whom have long-standing dysphagia and aspiration research groups focused on ARF. We will conduct a multi-center cohort study with three complementary aims that are interrelated and use the same patients; but are not dependent upon the results of each other. Aim #1 will determine whether our 5-item decision tree algorithm is a more effective screening tool to identify patients at high risk for post-extubation aspiration compared to the three-ounce water swallow test (3-WST) and the Toronto Bedside Swallowing Screening Test (TOR-BSST). These results will establish the optimal screening test for post-extubation aspiration and identify those patients who require further invasive diagnostic testing such as a FEES examination. Aim #2 will identify unique subphenotypes of patients with post-extubation aspiration based upon FEES-related measures of upper airway structure and function. Using a novel latent class analysis, we will determine whether these subphenotypes are associated with different trajectories of recovery and identify unique patients who benefit from different personalized and targeted therapies. Aim #3 will determine the association between ultrasound determined ETT size/tracheal diameter ratio and post-extubation aspiration while accounting for other confounding variables. This aim will identify the most effective method to select the ETT size that optimizes ventilatory management and decreases post- extubation aspiration. The results of this aim will pave the wave for dramatic improvements in the intubation process for all ARF patients who require mechanical ventilation. With an innovative and protocolized approach, the results of this proposal will demonstrate novel methods to minimize post-extubation aspiration, transform the multidisciplinary care of ARF survivors, and improve patient outcomes and quality of life. Project Narrative Nearly half a million people each year lose their ability to breath on their own and are treated by placing a breathing tube in their throat. After regaining their ability to breath, as many as 44% of patients may have trouble swallowing. This proposal will identify modifiable factors, determine the optimal screening tool, and classify specific groups of patients who may have different rates of recovery of their swallowing difficulties. Overall, this research will improve the care of patients recovering from critical illnesses and pave the way for the discovery of novel treatments for their swallowing dysfunction.",Aspiration in Acute Respiratory Failure Survivors,10274845,R01NR019989,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Boston', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Critical Illness', 'Decision Trees', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dyes', 'Enteral', 'Enteral Feeding', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluable Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging', 'Focus Groups', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Infrastructure', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Long-Term Care', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mosses', 'New England', 'Oral', 'Pathologist', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Pneumonia', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rogaine', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tube', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Water', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'cost', 'endotracheal', 'feeding', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'screening', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,704219
"mHealth Tympanometer: A Digital Innovation to Address Preventable Childhood Hearing Loss in Low- and Middle-Income Countries ABSTRACT Hearing loss is the second leading impairment worldwide. Childhood hearing loss has lifelong implications and disproportionately affects individuals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Up to 75% of childhood hearing loss in LMICs is preventable due to the high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. School hearing screening is critical for identification of childhood hearing loss in low resource settings, where newborn screening is unavailable. However, most screening programs only use pure-tone screening that does not identify middle ear disease widespread in populations with a high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. This is because tympanometry, used to clinically identify middle ear disease, is expensive and designed for trained professionals. Our goal is to develop and validate an mHealth tympanometer with machine learning diagnostic support to transform this technology into a low-cost tool that could be broadly disseminated in LMICs, where the burden of hearing loss is greatest and is not addressed by current hearing screening methodology. Our study team is comprised of international leaders in hearing loss, audiology, data science, engineering, user- centered design, and device development in LMICs. We have also partnered with hearX, a University of Pretoria spinout company that developed the only validated mHealth pure-tone screening device. To test this new device in an appropriate LMIC setting, we have partnered with the South African site from the Global HEAR Collaborative, our consortium of collaborators from 28 countries that is the only international research network dedicated to hearing loss. We documented the need for this device in a large cluster randomized trial recently completed in rural Alaska, where tympanometry significantly improved the accuracy of school hearing screening in a population with a high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. Using data from this trial and pilot funding, we are developing a machine learning tympanometry algorithm for lay screeners, and early hardware prototype fabrication is underway. In Aim 1, we will refine the hardware prototype using a user-centered design approach, cyclically incorporating feedback from South African team members during testing in a lab environment. In Aim 2, we will develop software through user-centered design that integrates the machine learning algorithm and refined hardware prototype. The resulting mHealth tympanometer will advance to the R33 phase. Technology development will be completed in Aims 3 and 4 through integration of the mHealth tympanometer with existing health information technology and an early feasibility study in 15 preschool children in South Africa to optimize device design for lay users. In Aim 5, we will validate the mHealth tympanometer with lay screeners through a clinical performance study in 500 preschool children in South Africa. This technology, developed through partnership and testing in an LMIC setting, will empower teachers and community health workers to identify children at risk for preventable hearing loss. The Global HEAR Collaborative will provide infrastructure for future studies with the proposed device across LMICs, directly addressing disparities in childhood hearing loss globally. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Childhood hearing loss disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where up to 75% of cases are preventable due to the high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. School hearing screening is critical for identification of childhood hearing loss in low resource settings, but most screening programs cannot identify middle ear disease that is widespread in populations with a high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. This study will develop and validate an mHealth tympanometer with machine learning diagnostic support to transform this technology into a low-cost tool that could be broadly disseminated in LMICs.",mHealth Tympanometer: A Digital Innovation to Address Preventable Childhood Hearing Loss in Low- and Middle-Income Countries,10269368,R21DC020134,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Alaska', 'Algorithms', 'Audiology', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Community Health Aides', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Ear', 'Ecosystem', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Language Development', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nursery Schools', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Tympanometry', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Widespread Disease', 'World Health Organization', 'childhood hearing loss', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'ear infection', 'early childhood', 'empowered', 'engineering design', 'health information technology', 'hearing impairment', 'hearing screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'middle ear disorder', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'rural Alaska', 'school health', 'screening', 'screening program', 'software development', 'teacher community', 'technology development', 'tool', 'user centered design', 'validation studies']",NIDCD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,98590
"Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations PROJECT SUMMARY  Large confirmatory or pragmatic clinical trials enroll patients from multiple centers to obtain high-quality evidence useful for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. The design of multicenter trials is particularly appealing to policymakers because many tend to be pragmatic and offer access to a large sample of diverse patient populations. Decision-makers trying to use the results of multicenter trials have specific target populations in mind. Yet, selection at both the center and individual participant level challenges the ability of even well-designed and conducted multicenter trials to draw inferences about any meaningful target population. These selection mechanisms, even in impeccably conducted multicenter trials, result in samples of trial participants that are not representative of any specific target population. When treatment effects are heterogeneous over covariates that are differentially distributed across centers, the overall trial average treatment effect estimate will not apply to any one of the populations underlying the participating centers or the target population. Consider for example, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a large multicenter trial of 33 centers (53,456 individuals) across the United States, which motivated this proposal. Because the positive benefits of screening are mainly concentrated in individuals at high-risk for lung cancer it is critical that individuals are appropriately targeted for screening recommendations. Our long-term objective is to optimize the applicability of trial results into clinical practice. We will take steps toward this objective by achieving the following specific aims: (1) Develop robust and efficient statistical methods, that can be combined with modern machine learning techniques, to reinterpret a multicenter trial in the context of each of the participating centers and to transport inferences from a multicenter trial to a new target population; (2) Evaluate the performance of methods developed in Aim 1 in simulation studies that reflect real-world data by considering scenarios with different sample sizes, number of centers, treatment effects, and outcome or selection mechanisms; (3) Apply the methods in the NLST to reinterpret the trial in the context of one of the participating centers and to transport trial findings to a new target population using baseline data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the United States general population. The proposed work is innovative for analyzing multicenter trials because it develops new methods, clarifies the assumptions needed for obtaining valid inference, and empirically assesses method performance. This work is significant because as a result of applying these methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials. Insights gained from this work will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. Selection bias at both the individual and center level challenge the applicability of trial findings to populations often underrepresented in trials, such as women, ethnic/racial minorities, or the elderly. This work aligns with AHRQ’s mission and priority areas because as a result of applying these proposed methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying target populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials, where decisions must be made.",Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations,10228266,R36HS028373,[' '],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R36,2021,43083
"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD.

"Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. As the disease remains largely asymptomatic until late stages, there is a pressing need to develop affordable approaches for screening before visual impairment occurs. Although sophisticated imaging technologies such as Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) can provide highly reproducible and accurate quantitative assessment of glaucomatous damage, their application in widespread screening or non-specialized settings is unfeasible, given the high cost and operator requirements. Fundus photography is a low-cost alternative that has been used successfully in teleophthalmology programs. However, subjective human grading of fundus photos for glaucoma is poorly reproducible and highly inaccurate, as gradings tend to largely over- or underestimate damage. We propose a new paradigm for assessing glaucomatous damage by training a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network to provide quantitative estimates of the amount of neural damage from fundus photographs. In our Machine-to-Machine (M2M) approach, we trained a DL network to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of glaucomatous damage provided by SDOCT, such as retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and neuroretinal rim measurements. Our preliminary results showed that the M2M predictions have very high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This provides an objective method to quantify neural damage in fundus photos without requiring human graders, which could potentially be used for screening, diagnoses and monitoring in teleophthalmology and non- specialized point-of-care settings. In this proposal, we aim at refining and validating the M2M model in suitable, large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records, and clinical trial data. Our central hypothesis is that the M2M approach will be more accurate than subjective human gradings in screening, diagnosing, predicting and detecting longitudinal damage over time. In Aim 1, we will investigate the performance of the M2M model to screen for glaucomatous damage using large datasets from 6 population-based studies: Blue Mountains Eye Study, Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, Tema Eye Survey, Beijing Eye Study, Central India Eye and Medical Study and the Ural Eye and Medical Study, which will provide data on over 25,000 subjects of diverse racial groups. In Aim 2, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model to predict future development of glaucoma in eyes of suspects using the data from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS). In Aim 3, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model in detecting glaucomatous progression over time using data from the Duke Glaucoma Registry, a large database of longitudinal structure and function data in glaucoma with over 25,000 patients followed over time. If successful, this proposal will lead to a validated, inexpensive, and widely applicable tool for screening, early diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma, that could be applied under population-based settings and also at non-specialized point-of-care settings. Project Narrative Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment in the world. This proposal will employ a novel artificial intelligence paradigm for quantifying neural damage on ocular fundus photographs for the purpose of screening, diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma damage. The approach will be validated on large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records and clinical trial data.","Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs",10225458,R21EY031898,"['Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'India', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Latino', 'Los Angeles', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Ocular Hypertension', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual impairment', 'algorithm training', 'clinical care', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'hypertension treatment', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'longitudinal database', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'point of care', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'screening', 'teleophthalmology', 'time use', 'tool']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,195212
"Handheld retinal camera for AI-based diabetic retinopathy screening PROJECT SUMMARY The CDC recommends that each of the 34.2 million patients with diabetes in the United States is screened annually for diabetic retinopathy (DR), a major cause of preventable blindness. Less than 50% of diabetes patients actually follow these guidelines due to lack of access to medical care and eye specialists, time and money constraints, and lack of symptoms with early-stage disease. To address these problems, our team at AI Optics is developing the world’s first artificial intelligence-based handheld retinal camera to allow for point-of-care DR screening. This device is designed to be portable, easy to use, and workflow friendly. It performs high-accuracy DR screenings on non-dilated patients, maintaining optimal security and remaining resilient to connectivity issues. Our goal is that this novel diagnostic device will expand DR screenings beyond the offices of eye specialists and into primary care, optometry offices, diabetes clinics, and retail health settings. This increased access to screening will increase early-stage diagnosis rates and avoid preventable vision loss. In this Phase I SBIR project, we will develop a retinal camera that complies with ISO 10940:2009 standards, which will be able to capture high-quality fundus images in a handheld device. To ensure that full-scale image classification can be conducted, we will also utilize our proprietary, deep-learning artificial intelligence system. Finally, we will ensure that images captured from our retinal camera can be analyzed by our artificial intelligence for the presence of DR. The successful completion of this project will result in an improved and more accessible tool for DR screenings that could lead to earlier DR diagnosis, blindness prevention, and significant cost savings for millions of people with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Less than 50% of the 34.2 million people with diabetes in the United States follow CDC guidelines to get annual screenings for diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of blindness that impacts up to 40% of diabetic patients. To address this problem, we propose the development of the world’s first handheld retinal camera that uses artificial intelligence for point-of-care DR screenings in primary care, urgent care, and retail health settings. As it can be operated without an eye specialist or Internet access, this handheld device will be portable, easy to use, and workflow friendly, enabling more screenings, earlier DR diagnosis, vision-loss prevention and significant cost savings for millions.",Handheld retinal camera for AI-based diabetic retinopathy screening,10324087,R43EY032822,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Hemorrhage', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optics', 'Optometry', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Point-of-Care Systems', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'base', 'commercialization', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'fundus imaging', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld equipment', 'improved', 'lens', 'novel diagnostics', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'prototype', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'retinal damage', 'retinal imaging', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'screening services', 'success', 'tool', 'urgent care']",NEI,AI OPTICS INC.,R43,2021,299219
"Development of a program to assess and treat distress in glaucoma patients using an automated EHR-derived AI algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is a disease that results in irreversible blindness and due to its chronic, progressive nature, imposes a psychosocial burden on patients. Appropriately, the focus of ophthalmologists is on controlling the disease to prevent vision loss. Yet, patient’s psychosocial distress during and after therapy has not been routinely addressed and is another important target of care. Psychosocial distress (i.e., anxiety, depression) negatively impacts all outcomes in glaucoma and is associated with poor follow-up and medication adherence, worse vision-related quality-of-life and disease severity, and faster rates of visual field progression. Direct assessment and treatment of psychosocial distress is likely to improve glaucoma outcomes. While uncommon in glaucoma clinics, psychosocial distress screening has been occurring with some consistency in other medical settings (e.g., oncology) for more than a decade, leading to referrals for intervention and improvements in psychosocial distress and subsequently overall health. Our overarching scientific premise is that a screening program for psychosocial distress (i.e., anxiety, depression) in glaucoma clinics would enhance the patient’s adherence to medical recommendations, and quality-of-life, ultimately leading to improvements in vision-related outcomes (e.g., visual field progression). Patient-reported outcome measures are the gold standard measures of distress, however are not routinely collected in patients with glaucoma due to perceived time and cost burdens. To remedy this, the PI proposes an automated pre-screening framework, motivated by preliminary analyses that demonstrate that distress can be reliably identified using predictive modeling based on glaucoma clinical risk factors from electronic health records (EHR) data. This predictive model will be developed in aim 1 using an existing EHR database, the Duke Glaucoma Registry, and will yield automated risk estimates of distress that can be used to inform clinical decision making, regarding the administration of a distress survey; therefore, limiting distress assessment to a subset of high-risk patients. Secondary aims will focus on external validation of the automated technique, and gauging acceptability to distress screening in a glaucoma clinic (aim 2), and the refinement of a behavioral intervention to improve coping skills for distress in patients with glaucoma (aim 3). This research will positively impact patient well- being in glaucoma, serving as an evidence-based assessment of a distress screening program. The proposal also details a training plan to help the PI transition from a postdoctoral scholar to an independent researcher. The mentored phase of the award will be supervised by the primary mentor, Dr. Felipe Medeiros, and multidisciplinary mentoring team including Dr. Tamara Somers (Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences), Dr. David Page (Biostatistics & Bioinformatics), and Dr. Kevin Weinfurt (Population Health Sciences). Performing the proposed research, formal coursework, and mentored career development will provide the PI with highly sought-after skills and experiences to help ensure a successful transition to independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychosocial distress is a common comorbidity associated with the glaucoma experience and left untreated can contribute to worse outcomes, including worse vision-related quality-of-life and disease severity, faster rates of visual field progression, and poor follow-up and medication adherence, and glaucoma comprehension. The work described in this proposal will introduce and validate an automated assessment and treatment screening program for distress in glaucoma, through innovative predictive modeling of existing healthcare and research database systems. The outcome of this project will shed light on the importance of recognizing distress in the course of glaucoma clinical care, and provide evidence to support new approaches and paradigms to assess and treat glaucoma-induced distress.",Development of a program to assess and treat distress in glaucoma patients using an automated EHR-derived AI algorithm,10282287,K99EY033027,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Comprehension', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Familiarity', 'Focus Groups', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of illness', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'coping', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'eye center', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'intervention program', 'medication compliance', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'model development', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient screening', 'population health', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'retention rate', 'screening', 'screening program', 'skills', 'standard measure', 'statistical and machine learning']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,115335
"Autonomous AI to mitigate disparities for diabetic retinopathy screening in youth during and after COVID-19 Project Summary  COVID-19 has led to disruptions and delays in routine pediatric care. For children with diabetes who see their diabetes team every 3 months, this has been reduced or transitioned to telemedicine due to COVID- 19. However, those without technology and internet capabilities, namely low income and minority youth, are less likely to participate in telemedicine and may see their diabetes team less frequently during the pandemic. Screening for diabetes complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), is generally fulfilled by a separate visit to an eye-care professional (ECP), and is also less likely to occur during COVID-19.  Diabetic retinopathy affects 4-15% of youth with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is a leading cause of blindness in adults as early as age 20. Yearly screening for DR is recommended, but only 35-72% of youth undergo screening, with minority youth and children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds less likely to undergo screening. Early detection of DR through screening prevents progression to vision loss. The current standard of care for pediatric DR screening is referral to an ECP for a dilated eye exam. Recently, the FDA approved the first autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) software that interprets retinal images taken with a non-mydriatic fundus camera, providing an immediate result for DR screening at the point of care (POC) for adults with diabetes. In a pilot study at our institution, we were the first to implement this technology in pediatrics, demonstrating safety, effectiveness and equity, and cost-savings to the patient. We also found that minority youth, those with lower household income and Medicaid insurance were less likely to undergo recommended screening, yet were more likely to have DR. This is likely to worsen due to the disparate effects of COVID-19.  We hypothesize that implementing POC autonomous AI in the diabetes care setting will increase DR screening rates in youth with diabetes, mitigate disparities in access to screening, and be cost-effective to the health care system now and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. In this proposal, we will first determine (Aim1) in a randomized control trial at two clinic sites if autonomous AI increases screening compared to ECP, and if those who screen positive by AI are more likely to go for follow-up at the ECP. In the second phase of this proposal (Aim2) we will perform a prospective observational trial of AI screening to determine if AI mitigates disparities in screening, and improves the proportion of at-risk, minority and low income, youth who go for follow-up if their AI screen is positive. In Aim 3, we will use a decision model to determine if AI is cost-effective and cost-savings to the health care system. If AI is shown to increase screening rates while mitigating disparities in access to care, it has the potential to reshape screening methods now and in the future. Project Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes for which children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are recommended to obtain annual screening for diabetic retinopathy. However, adherence rates are suboptimal with only 50% of children obtaining the recommended screening, which is likely to worsen during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for at-risk, minority and low-income, youth who have been disproportionately affected. In this proposal, we aim to implement a new and innovative technology in the diabetes care setting, using a non-mydriatic fundus camera with autonomous artificial intelligence to provide screening and results at the point of care as a means to improve screening rates, mitigate disparities in access to screening and determine cost-effectiveness to the health care system.",Autonomous AI to mitigate disparities for diabetic retinopathy screening in youth during and after COVID-19,10309013,R01EY033233,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood diabetes', 'Clinic', 'Communities', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'FDA approved', 'Fundus photography', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Household', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Low income', 'Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ocular Prosthesis', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Randomized', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Screening Result', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adherence rate', 'arm', 'behavioral economics', 'care outcomes', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diabetic', 'digital healthcare', 'disparity elimination', 'economic impact', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'low socioeconomic status', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'pandemic disease', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'racial bias', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'routine care', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'standard of care', 'success', 'trial comparing', 'underserved community']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,494765
"Optimizing population health outcomes in diabetic retinopathy through personalized and scalable screening strategies Project Summary / Abstract According to the National Eye Institute (NEI), early detection and timely treatment can reduce the risk of severe vision loss from diabetic retinopathy (DR) by 95%. Yet, DR remains the leading cause of blindness among American adults. By 2030, 54.9 million Americans are expected to have diabetes. The prevalence of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) among people with diabetes is 4.4% and 10.2% in the US and worldwide, respectively, representing over 28 million people at risk of blindness. Because DR causes no pain, vision loss, or other symptoms at its early stages and only 50% of people with diabetes receive annual eye exams, many will be unaware of their disease until vision loss is irreversible. Retinal Care Inc. (RCI) believes that the root cause of this public health failure is more behavioral and educational than clinical; complete adherence to screening and treatment would prevent nearly all vision loss from DR. However, 100% adherence is not feasible, practical, or cost-effective. Eliminating blindness from DR requires a strategy shift that acknowledges that preventing vision loss from DR does not require a 100% annual screening rate; it requires only that all patients with VTDR are evaluated by an eye care provider and adhere to follow up recommendations. RCI's approach to cost-effectively eliminating blindness from DR is to prioritize patients who are most likely to require immediate attention and devote the resources necessary to ensure they are evaluated by an eye care provider. The proposed project is designed to accomplish this goal through VTDR risk prediction; targeted patient engagement, education, and behavioral interventions; and optimization of the full system to achieve maximum population benefit. In Aim 1, RCI will leverage our existing Data Repository and machine learning methods to predict VTDR risk using electronic health record (EHR) and healthcare insurance claims data, with the initial goal of correctly placing over 90% of patients with VTDR in the highest-risk half of the population when ordered by risk. In doing so, RCI can focus patient engagement resources on patients who are most likely to need immediate evaluation and treatment, rather than diverting resources to patients who are less likely to require immediate attention. In Aim 2, RCI will use mixed methods framed by the Integrated Behavior Model to identify barriers and motivators for screening and assess their relative importance, develop and implement a survey instrument to elicit willingness to participate in screening based on motivating factors and barrier removal, and use natural language processing to detect barriers and facilitators for diabetic eye screening from patient communications. In Aim 3, RCI will create an agent-based simulation tool to guide care coordination recommendations in a way that maximizes population health outcomes subject to constraints on time and cost. The tool will identify optimal intervention strategies and be adaptable to changes in cost, disease burden, patient preference, population characteristics, and other parameters. Decisions that will be optimized include resource allocation as a function of risk, intervention timing, screening modality, communication strategies, barrier removal strategies, and other modifiable aspects of the system. Project Narrative Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is expected to affect over 11 million people in the US by 2030 and is the leading cause of blindness in American adults, despite vision loss being almost entirely preventable with timely detection and treatment. To prevent blindness from DR, the Retinal Care-DR program is designed to eliminate the deficiencies of the current care delivery model by implementing a first-of-its-kind, personalized care coordination program guided by individual disease risk and population-level outcomes. This will be accomplished through the application of machine learning to prioritize patients for care coordination by disease risk, development of tools to identify and understand the impact of barriers and motivators for diabetic eye screening for high risk patients, and care coordination decision logic guided by agent-based simulation to maximize population health outcomes subject to financial constraints.",Optimizing population health outcomes in diabetic retinopathy through personalized and scalable screening strategies,10324935,R44EY033251,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'North Carolina', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Public Health', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Service delivery model', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data repository', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'high risk', 'insurance claims', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'intervention effect', 'machine learning method', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'personalized care', 'population based', 'population health', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal imaging', 'risk prediction', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'screening participation', 'simulation', 'software development', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'tool development', 'willingness']",NEI,"RETINAL CARE, INC.",R44,2021,931698
"DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics PROJECT SUMMARY DAT18-06 The personal, social, and public health burdens of substance use disorders (SUDs) in the United States have been compounded by the opioid epidemic and legalization of recreational and medical cannabis use. Traditionally, healthcare systems have referred patients with SUDs to specialists. Although SUD treatment is associated with improved outcomes, most people with SUDs remain unidentified and untreated. The magnitude of unmet need has led experts to recommend incorporating screening and assessment for SUDs into routine primary care (PC), to increase rates of diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. Despite extensive observational research, to our knowledge no randomized controlled trial has evaluated the impact of PC-based programs of screening and assessment on new SUD treatment. The proposed study takes advantage of a unique and fortuitous opportunity to evaluate the impact of a PC program of screening and assessment for SUDs on new diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. The Sustained Patient-centered Alcohol Related Care (SPARC) trial, completed in July 2018, was a rigorously-designed randomized implementation trial testing a multifaceted approach to improving care for unhealthy alcohol use. However, at the request of clinical leaders at Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) where the SPARC program was implemented, routine screening and assessment for opioid, cannabis, and other drug use disorders (CUD, OUD, and DUD, respectively) were added before the trial was launched in 22 KPWA PC clinics. As a result, the SPARC trial's implementation program—consisting of practice coaching, electronic health record (EHR) support, performance monitoring and feedback, and provider training—also targeted SUDs. Data from health system monitoring reports indicate the trial achieved high, sustained rates of screening for SUDs, exceeding the target of 80% of patients with PC visits. However, the SPARC trial was only funded to evaluate alcohol-related outcomes. The proposed study will rigorously evaluate the SPARC program's impact on the clinically meaningful primary outcome of new SUD treatment within 90 days of a primary care visit (Aim 1). To illuminate potential continued gaps in the quality of SUD care (Aim 2), we will use natural language processing (NLP) to extract and quantify reasons why: 1) patients reporting ≥4 DSM-5 symptoms of SUDs do not receive formal coded diagnoses of OUD, CUD, or DUD, and 2) why patients with newly diagnosed OUDs, CUDs, and DUDs do not received treatment. Most people with OUDs, CUDs, and other DUDs are never treated. An estimated 2.5-3.9% of US adults have past-year SUDs, and nearly 90% report no SUD treatment. Yet >84% of US adults have outpatient visits annually, and over half of these visits are in PC. If the proposed innovative study demonstrates that screening and assessment in PC increase SUD treatment, it would provide support for a widely endorsed yet previously untested approach to addressing a critically important gap in the quality of care for SUDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug use disorders associated with unhealthy opioid, cannabis, and other drug use are major public health concerns but most people with these disorders remain untreated. Experts recommend systematic screening and assessment in primary care as a way to improve SUD treatment, but the effectiveness of such programs is unknown. This study rigorously evaluates such a program through an opportunity created when screening and assessment for drug use disorders were unexpectedly added to a randomized, stepped wedge, 22-clinic trial originally planned to focus exclusively on alcohol use disorders.",DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics,10237870,R01DA047312,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohols', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'DSM-V', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Medical', 'Medical Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Observational Study', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Shame', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'design', 'disability', 'health data', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'implementation trial', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'marijuana use', 'neglect', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'patient oriented', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'social', 'social stigma', 'substance use treatment', 'therapy design']",NIDA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,403750
"A Software Product That Empowers Individuals Affected By Substance Use Disorders and Their Care Teams with Health and Social Resources Project Summary Access and participation in community resource programs such as transportation, housing and medication assistance - also known as social determinants of health (SDOH) is inextricably linked to a successful treatment and recovery in substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, health and social service providers dedicate a significant amount of time to curate local community resource listings or “referral binders”. These “referral binders” are often highly duplicated and fragmented across organizations and by using expensive non-scalable solutions technology vendors in this domain have not fully addressed this problem. Furthermore, participation in such community programs is also hindered by the absence of highly efficient program eligibility screening tools. Undoubtedly, these shortcomings contribute to lack of direct access to recovery capital for individuals affected by SUD.  We report two feasibility outcomes from our SBIR Phase I study. 1) A novel co-creation led business model that leverages local partnerships with subject matter expertise agencies on SUD and SDOH - can provide enhanced access to community resource programs at the point-of-care. 2) A highly adaptive digital assisted SDOH screening tool powered by novel conversational artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies can enhance patients’ participation in SDOH related community programs. This is achieved by using these technologies to perform program eligibility screenings through both web and text messaging channels coupled with patient triaging within a case work team. The purpose of this Phase II study is to: 1) Optimize and scale the community resource co-creation business model established in Phase I by onboarding eight co-creation partners in Texas within 2 years. 2) Examine the relationship between the conversational AI and NLP powered SDOH screening tool piloted in Phase I with SUD outcomes among youths and young adults. Specifically, we will partner with the Harris Center for Mental Health and IDD - the largest outpatient mental health provider in Texas to examine whether youths screened and enrolled into a treatment program using our technology report improved SUD outcomes. As AI and NLP are core pillars of our technology we will also investigate and subsequently correct for potential societal biases and stereotypes (e.g. race, gender) encoded in such technologies. This effort will avoid such biases to inadvertently determine outcomes in our downstream prediction tasks. The key Phase II milestones include; 1) Demonstrable evidence that the co-creation business model leads to enhanced access to SDOH and SUD community resources at the point-of-care. 2) An understanding on whether screening and eventual participation in a treatment program as supported by our conversational AI technology can lead to reduced encounters with law enforcement including CPS among youths with mental health and SUD. In summary, the proposed Phase II work will lead to enhanced access to SUD recovery capital and facilitate patients’ participation in local health and SDOH community programs. Project Narrative Social factors such as housing, transportation and medication have a significant impact on substance use treatment and recovery outcomes. This Phase II proposal will expand our co-creation model that leverages local community partnerships to curate community resources. In addition, our AI powered digital assisted SDOH screening tool will identify eligible patients and connect them to the services to improve the efficiency of patient screening and intake process.",A Software Product That Empowers Individuals Affected By Substance Use Disorders and Their Care Teams with Health and Social Resources,10360396,R44DA051063,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Businesses', 'Capital', 'Caring', 'Client', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Counseling', 'County', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Distal', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Law Enforcement', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Participation', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Sex Bias', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Impacts', 'Social Work', 'Stereotyping', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Transportation', 'United States', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'Youth', 'behavioral health', 'child protective service', 'cohort', 'community partnership', 'digital', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mental health center', 'non-compliance', 'novel', 'opioid overdose', 'patient screening', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'point of care', 'programs', 'prototype', 'racial bias', 'recruit', 'scale up', 'screening', 'service programs', 'service providers', 'service utilization', 'social', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'societal costs', 'substance use treatment', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'treatment risk', 'young adult']",NIDA,"MEDICAL INNOVATORS COMPANY, LLC",R44,2021,425535
"Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment PROJECT SUMMARY In this Phase II SBIR project, Parabon NanoLabs will complete the development, validation and commercialization of CTX, a revolutionary smartphone- and tablet-based cognitive testing platform for collection and analysis of measurements of cognitive performance (“phenotypes”). Traditionally, cognitive assessments are performed in a clinic using either simple surveys that assess only some aspects of cognition or expensive, single-purpose equipment such as eye tracking stations. Such testing lacks the frequency and precision needed to detect subtle early changes that signal the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early-symptomatic dementia. Instead, CTX will take full advantage of mobile sensors (e.g., audio, video, touchscreen, and motion) to enable in-depth cognitive testing anytime, anywhere. Regular use of CTX will allow a clearer picture of each user's cognitive abilities to emerge, enabling early detection of subtle changes. CTX is not intended to replace neurologists but instead to extend their reach by allowing regular, widespread screening for improved disease detection and patient monitoring. The long-range goal of CTX is to allow aging adults to monitor and manage their cognitive health more effectively and to provide pre-symptomatic indicators of pending dementia to patients and their clinicians, thus enabling early intervention and planning. After a highly successful Phase I project, CTX already enables rapid development of mobile tests that can capture raw sensor streams in a synchronized fashion and transmit them to a cloud server for subsequent analysis and reporting. Sophisticated analytics pipelines have been developed to convert these sensor streams into cognitive phenotypes (e.g., extracting eye movement data from selfie video taken during a cognitive test). Using the CTX framework, the Parabon team has already developed an Apple® iOS® mobile app with proof-of-principle tests for assessing verbal recall, eye movement, motor function, and episodic memory. In Phase II, we propose to develop two new suites of CTX tests for one-time cognitive impairment screening and cognitive performance monitoring, as well as phenotype extraction pipelines for each. We will evaluate tests in normal and affected cohorts to determine usability, user retention and whether resulting phenotypes enable accurate cognitive assessments by clinicians. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop new and engaging cognitive tests and pipelines for assessing visual search and targeting, expressive and receptive language, motor movement and episodic memory; (2) Validate measures in cognitively normal and impaired cohorts; and (3) Analyze and prepare data for publication and premarket submissions to the FDA. PROJECT NARRATIVE According to the World Health Organization, the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple from 50 million to 152 million by 2050. Existing pen-and-paper cognitive tests used for dementia screening were designed to detect overt disease, but early detection of cognitive decline is needed for proper intervention and planning. In this project, we are developing a smartphone- and tablet-based set of highly accurate tests that can be used for one-time cognitive impairment screening and game-like activities for ongoing cognitive health monitoring.",Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment,10255750,R44AG062072,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Apple', 'COVID-19', 'CTF1 gene', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Episodic memory', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'General Practitioners', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Lewy Body Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Saccades', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stream', 'Surveys', 'Tablets', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thumb structure', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'arm', 'base', 'cloud platform', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'design', 'diagnostic screening', 'digital', 'digital health', 'early screening', 'experience', 'functional decline', 'handheld mobile device', 'home test', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile application', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'peace', 'performance tests', 'recruit', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'touchscreen', 'tv watching', 'usability', 'visual search', 'visual tracking']",NIA,"PARABON NANOLABS, INC.",R44,2021,1186625
"Finding combinatorial drug repositioning therapy for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias PROJECT SUMMARY AD/ADRD are highly complex diseases characterized by distinct molecular pathways and neuropathological phenotypes. Unfortunately, the treatment remains at best modestly effective and no new drugs have been approved since 2003. Combinatorial drug therapy for AD/ADRD treatment has not been intensively studied but it is highly promising. We hypothesize that finding repositioned drug combinations through innovative exploration of big data may uncover effective AD/ADRD treatments, with implicit advantages in overcoming drug resistance and targeting multiple biomarkers. We will combine big biomedical data from complementary sources, novel and advanced informatics models, clinical domain expertise, as well as biology knowledge and validation into a coherent framework to tackle AD/ADRD with potential combinatorial drug therapies. In an exponentially larger and more challenging space of combinatorial drug therapy, opportunities are also exponentially larger when compared with traditional single-drug models but many computational challenges need to be carefully handled. We will develop multiple computational models under two philosophical umbrellas, with focuses on quantifiable screening and biological understanding. Our findings will be validated with biological experiments from cell to mouse. If successful, we will significantly advance AD/ADRD research and benefit patients with safe and effective treatment. NARRATIVE The project aims at identifying novel drug combination therapies for AD/ADRD prevention and treatment using advanced informatics methods. We propose multiple strategies focusing on quantifiable screening and biological understanding using large healthcare databases and biology/pharmacogenomics knowledgebases.

"Phenotypic Screening for Longevity Interventions Using Single-cell Epigenetic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. However, such interventions should have essentially no toxicity or side effects. In practice, the throughput of drug testing (currently conducted in animals) is one of the major limitations for identifying interventions to promote healthy aging. Hence, a challenge is to identify candidate drugs able to induce rejuvenation and/or healthy aging, with minimal side effects in a high throughput fashion. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel high content screening approach based on imaging of epigenetic landscape in single cells. To meet the challenge, we propose to take advantage of a novel technique we have developed that is rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level, automated microscopy, and machine learning. “Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes” (MIEL) captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. Pertinent to this application, we have tested whether MIEL approach is suitable for building a phenotypic cell-based assay for inducers of longevity at the cellular level. Our preliminary results validated MIEL assay for a high content screening application to identify novel candidate pro-longevity compounds. In sum, we have developed and validated a high content cell-based screening assay capable of identifying pro-longevity/healthy aging compounds based on their effect on epigenetic signature. Our specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1. Screen for novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation. Specific Aim 2. Validation of novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation.

"I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges Project Summary Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among older adults in the United States. However, despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer- related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. Barriers to appropriate screening are even greater for groups facing long-standing screening disparities, such as racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES). Key drivers of screening underutilization are decision-making biases facing clinicians and patients, highlighting the need for scalable solutions that are designed to address these biases and tailored to overcome barriers facing high-risk patients.  Nudges, interventions designed using behavioral economic principles, improve behavior by addressing biases that lead to suboptimal decisions. Our team has extensive experience working with health systems to test and scale nudge interventions to overcome decision-making biases facing patients and/or clinicians. We have also demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, it is an ideal platform upon which to deploy large scale behavior change nudge interventions.  In this study, we propose to personalize nudge interventions to clinicians and patients, with a focus on how to tailor nudges to the needs of high-risk patients and how to implement promising nudges to improve cancer screening among older adults. We will pilot this work at Penn Medicine and then implement a pragmatic trial at sites in the Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health systems.  In the R61 phase, we will complete the following aims at Penn Medicine: analyze EHR and claims data and identify characteristics and subgroups of patients at high-risk for not completing cancer screening (Aim 1), test the feasibility of individual nudge interventions within an EHR nudge toolkit (Aim 2), and pilot test nudge interventions to identify the most promising approaches to increase cancer screening rates for high-risk patients in each subgroup (Aim 3).  In the R33 phase, we will achieve the following aims at Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health: conduct a two-arm pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of personalized EHR-based nudges to clinicians and patients on increasing cancer screening rates (Aim 1), evaluate if EHR-based nudge interventions reduce disparities in cancer screening rates for racial/ethnic minorities and patients with low socioeconomic status (Aim 2), and inform future design of tailored EHR interventions by examining heterogeneity of treatment response with respect to clinician and patient characteristics (Aim 3). Project Narrative Despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer-related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. In this project, we will pilot nudge interventions among older adults – including racial/ethnic minorities, low SES individuals, and other high-risk groups identified using novel analytic methods – and tailor nudges to overcome screening barriers facing these patient groups. We will then conduct a pragmatic, multisite trial evaluating the ability for tailored nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates and reduce disparities in care.",I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges,10238838,R61AG068947,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medicine', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Vaccination', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'cancer health disparity', 'clinical care', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost', 'design', 'discounting', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness testing', 'end of life', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'health care disparity', 'health care settings', 'heuristics', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention cost', 'low socioeconomic status', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'operation', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'racial and ethnic', 'scale up', 'screening', 'screening disparities', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2021,294241
"Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Health disparities exist in cancer screening and mortality. Although cancer mortality rates have decreased steadily over the past 25 years, the racial gap persists, and socioeconomic disparities are widening. Improved early detection and treatment can decrease cancer mortality, but many barriers exist to screening uptake. Cancer screening is often a trade-off for both patients and clinicians among different cancer screenings and other preventive opportunities, each of which have their own barriers to completion. This study seeks to improve quality of care and reduce health disparities in cancer mortality by using informatics to better tailor clinical discussions in order to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and help overcome barriers to screening. The study has the following aims: 1) to develop a predictive model that identifies patients > 50 years old eligible for lung, breast and colorectal cancer screening who are at high-risk for missing these screenings; 2) to develop and pilot test a prototype shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians that will increase screening uptake; 3) to perform a pragmatic trial of the refined multilevel intervention that utilizes a shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians.  During the planning phase, data from the electronic health record (EHR) will be combined with supplementary data sources (e.g. Area Health Resource File, LexisNexis) to identify patients at risk of not completing recommended screening for these cancers. Hold-out cross-validation will be used to estimate model accuracy. Machine learning model building following feature selection will utilize logistic regression and decision trees to ensure the models are easily transferable to other healthcare settings and interpretable. This predictive model will be used to develop and pilot test an application that will (A) utilize predictive modeling to identify eligible patients likely to miss screening; (B) determine, after providing patient education, patient preferences and concerns regarding screening through self-report augmented by predictive modelling; (C) identify available community resources to facilitate screening; (D) provide this information to patients and to clinicians in the EHR prior to clinical visits to assist shared decision-making conversations and support active problem solving of identified barriers. This multilevel intervention will be pilot-tested and refined within 4 academic primary care practices over 6 months (N=24 clinicians; 8181 potential screenings yearly). A pragmatic trial will be conducted during the R33 phase using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design (N=45 clinicians; 11,239 potential screenings yearly). Completed cancer screening will be the primary outcome. Patient experience, clinician satisfaction and utilization will also be assessed. If successful, this approach will lead to an intervention tailored to the patient and their community that leverages information technology in a scalable way that is transferrable to other clinical settings and types of preventive services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant disparities exist in breast, colorectal and lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer mortality, requiring the development of new interventions that increase screening uptake in diverse populations. We propose an intervention that employs a multilevel approach that leverages the Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supplementary data sources to develop a predictive model to identify eligible patients at high-risk of not obtaining screening and to facilitate improved shared decision-making conversations using an EHR based decision-making support tool that interacts with patients and clinicians. By personalizing the approach to screening and improving the quality of patient-clinician interactions, we hope to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and reduce health disparities.",Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention,10238833,R61AG068951,"['Advisory Committees', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Preventive screening', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural Community', 'Screening for cancer', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer type', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'health care settings', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model building', 'mortality', 'personalized approach', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'regression trees', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening services', 'sex', 'shared decision making', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R61,2021,283016
"A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care Settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The number of people with Alzheimer’s disease is expected to exceed 88 million by 2050. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders symptoms are imperative for efforts to develop disease modifying therapies or interventions, and are important for optimal patient care. The objective of this proposal is to provide an accurate, feasible, and low-cost process to facilitate cognitive screening in population health. The aims of the R61 project are to develop and validate two complementary, automated tools to identify and screen patients at high risk for cognitive decline. The first is a risk calculator that uses routine clinical data to estimate patients’ risk for cognitive decline. Patients 60 years and older will undergo formal cognitive testing, and five prior years of routinely-collected electronic health record data will be used to model cognitive status. The Cognitive Risk Calculator will be validated in two historical samples and integrated into the electronic medical record to help providers identify vulnerable patients. The second tool is a validated iPad-based screening tool, the Brief Assessment of Cognitive Health (BACH) that patients can complete independently before, during, or after their doctor appointment. Patients will complete the BACH, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (a paper-and-pencil screening tool), and formal neuropsychological testing at two time points. We hypothesize the BACH will be more sensitive to cognitive change over time than the established screening tool. The BACH is already integrated into the Epic electronic medical record platform; cognitive score and screening results for depression, stress, and sleep disruption are automatically recorded in the patient’s medical record for providers to document and act upon. The R33 project is a Phase IV pragmatic clinical trial to gauge the uptake and utility of these tools in primary care practices. Six internal medicine clinics will be randomized over time to the active study arm (Risk Calculator and BACH). This will permit comparisons of standard of care screening practices with screening activities following introduction of the Cognitive Risk Calculator and BACH. We will use a mixed-methods approach to determine optimal implementation strategies across a variety of practice models. Impact: The EHR risk-calculator and BACH have the capacity to improve detection of cognitive decline on a population health scale. The project also examines how regional differences in socioeconomic advantage relate to health disparities measured in terms of cognitive risk as well as screening attitudes and behaviors on the part of both providers and patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Population health protocols lack efficient and effective methods to screen cognitive health.

"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,10144396,R01AR074958,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomechanics', 'Blinded', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip Fractures', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive treatment', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'bone', 'bone strength', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'diagnostic screening', 'ductile', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fracture risk', 'high risk', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromuscular', 'older patient', 'patient health information', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'standing height', 'theories', 'tool']",NIAMS,"O.

"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD. The goal of this study is to test a machine learning predictive model of PPD using information in patients’ medical records to decrease PPD’s prevalence and ultimately prevent it.",Predictive modeling of peripartum depression,10131234,R03HD101724,"['Adopted', 'Adult Children', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Etiology', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infanticide', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive service', 'Primigravidities', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening procedure', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Suicide', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Cost', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'antenatal', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'health of the mother', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'neonatal health', 'novel', 'obstetric care', 'patient health information', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'preventive intervention', 'primipara', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'tool']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,84000
"Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders. Abstract: Newborn screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has transformed our ability to identify and provide early, lifesaving treatment to infants with inborn errors of metabolism. While MS/MS screening identifies most affected babies, it is accompanied by frequent false-positive results that require collecting blood and urine samples for additional confirmatory testing. While DNA sequencing has become an important part of confirmatory testing, newborn dried blood spots (DBS) yield only small and highly variable DNA amounts. There is an urgent need for a more efficient second-tier NBS approach for confirming all screen-positive cases directly from the DBS cards collected at birth. This is especially critical for infants at risk for metabolic disease in their first weeks of life. The overall objective of this proposal is to combine novel DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology to diagnose inborn metabolic disorders from DBS, and to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of this approach for second-tier screening. To achieve this objective, the following specific aims will be pursued: (1) Develop multiplex gene sequencing (RUSPseq) and 10X linked-read sequencing for rapid genetic diagnosis without the need for additional parental testing; (2) Develop mass spectrometry (Q-TOF/LC-MS) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning to identify novel metabolic markers, which will be integrated in a novel second-tier screening panel to separate true and false-positive cases; and (3) Demonstrate clinical and translational feasibility of this approach to more rapidly identify both true and false-positive cases. We will work with the public NBS program and NBSTRN’s Pilot Research and Implementation workgroup to translate this combined approach into second-tier NBS. These outcomes will have significant impact by reducing diagnostic delays and uncertainties, and by reducing iterative testing rounds and the cost associated with them, thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare system as well as patients and their families. Project Narrative: We will establish novel genetic and metabolomic technology for newborn screening (NBS) from dried blood spots, and apply machine learning to reduce false-positive screens and delayed diagnosis of true-positive cases. Early detection and confirmation of inborn errors of metabolism that can present in the first weeks of life is critical, specifically when screening in diverse multiethnic populations where we have less understanding of the biochemical genetic and clinical phenotypes. We will work with local hospitals and the NBS program to establish clinical and translational validity to this new project, which will contribute to maintaining parental trust in public NBS.",Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders.,10251254,R01HD102537,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Compound Q', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Work', 'carrier status', 'case control', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'improved', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'multi-ethnic', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening panel', 'screening program', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'web-based tool']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,505339
"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,10057390,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychoses', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,748815
"Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions Protein-peptide interactions are prevalent in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulation, and immune response. Peptide-based therapeutics have attracted much attention in recent years, and a significantly growing number of peptide-based medicines have been designed and approved for a variety of diseases. Therefore, studying protein-peptide interactions is of great significance for mechanistic investigation of many biological processes and for peptide therapeutic development. However, because of the difficulties and cost for determining such structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, currently there are only a limited number of protein-peptide complex structures in the Protein Data Bank. Thus, the ability to predict protein- peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. However, structure prediction for protein-peptide complexes is challenging, particularly due to peptide flexibility. In this project, we will address this challenging issue by innovative integration of bioinformatics and physical modeling approaches. Specifically, we propose to achieve four goals: Goal #1: We will develop novel deep-learning models for protein-peptide structure prediction. Despite successful application of deep learning to protein structure prediction and protein-ligand interaction, deep learning has not been applied to protein-peptide structure prediction yet, due to the flexibility and the resulting large degrees of freedom in peptides. Goal #2: We will develop the first in silico screening method for the search of peptide-based inhibitors, and will construct novel peptide libraries for screening. Our in silico method will be an attractive complement to valuable experimental technologies such as phage display and yeast two-hybrid system for rapid peptide screening at much lower cost. Goal #3: We will convert our computational algorithms into a modular, extensible, open-source software package that can be disseminated to the computational modeling community at no cost. Goal #4. As a proof-of-concept application of our in silico screening method, we will screen for novel peptide leads by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance, in collaboration with my experimental collaborator whose expertise is in molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology. The ability to predict protein-peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. We propose to tackle the challenge of protein- peptide structure prediction, including developing the first in silico peptide screening method to dramatically save cost and time.

"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",10152666,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'genetic testing', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,788885
"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening. This program will significantly increase knowledge of how to overcome the real-world issue of how to effectively and efficiently screen for atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.",Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions,10188627,K01HL148506,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Home', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senior Scientist', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data registry', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient screening', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk minimization', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'screening program', 'stroke risk', 'structured data', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2021,177788
"A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2015, tuberculosis (TB) surpassed HIV as the number one cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. In the U.S., California has the highest incidence and largest number of TB cases in the nation, comprising nearly one-quarter of all new active TB cases in 2017. More than 80% of active TB disease in the U.S. is due to reactivation, which could be prevented via screening and treatment of LTBI. Yet, adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. The screening guidelines are inefficient and rely on data that are almost never available to clinicians, and the treatment guidelines are confusing. Further, treatment initiation and completion rates are low for patients with LTBI and the barriers to successful treatment are poorly understood. To address these missed opportunities, we will use expansive electronic health record data across 2 of the largest healthcare institutions in California as well as qualitative data from LTBI stakeholders to conduct three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will look at current gaps in screening practices for LTBI, as well as gaps in the guidelines themselves, by simulating what it would look like if screening was being perfectly implemented. To do this, we will collect laboratory testing data for LTBI stratified by characteristics of interest and will use modeling to estimate the number of TB cases prevented by current screening as a measure of effectiveness. We will use simulation models to estimate effectiveness of optimal screening. For Aim 2, we will develop and validate new screening and treatment guidelines for LTBI based on variables widely available in electronic health records. First, we will use machine learning and traditional regression to identify risk factors for positive LTBI tests and reactivation TB. Next, we will assign risk scores to each risk factor, and will use joint probability analyses to identify populations at greatest need for screening and treatment. To estimate performance of the newly proposed strategy, we will use simulation modeling. For Aim 3, we will develop and pilot a culturally-tailored educational video intervention to improve LTBI treatment initiation and completion. We will first identify barriers to treatment adherence through qualitative interviews with patients and providers and will subsequently develop a short video based on findings from the interview. We will perform an individually randomized efficacy trial to assess impact of the intervention on initiation and treatment completion rates. The approach is innovative because we propose a complete re-framing of the current U.S. LTBI control strategy in a way that dramatically enhances ease-of-use for frontline providers. Results of this work will make a significant contribution to public health by providing low-cost and easily expandable solutions to address ongoing and substantial gaps in the current LTBI care continuum. PROJECT NARRATIVE California has the highest incidence and largest number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the contiguous U.S., of which 80% are due to reactivation. These TB cases can be prevented via screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), yet, current adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. We will leverage expansive electronic health record data from two of the largest healthcare organizations in California to create and validate a new LTBI screening and treatment approach that can vastly improve identification and successful treatment of LTBI.",A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment,10129277,R01AI151072,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'effectiveness measure', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care service organization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'simulation', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment guidelines', 'wasting']",NIAID,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,798304
"Identifying effective and efficient approaches to tuberculosis screening in Brazilianprisons Abstract. The goal of this career development plan is to support Dr. Leonardo Martinez, an infectious disease epidemiologist, in developing an independent research program focused on increasing tuberculosis case detection in high-risk groups. In active tuberculosis case finding studies, the majority of individuals are unable to provide sputum. In our previous work in Brazilian prisons, mass screening for tuberculosis among incarcerated individuals found a hyperendemic level of disease burden, 3,900 cases per 100,000 prisoners. We hypothesize that the tuberculosis burden in these prisons is greater than our current estimates, as a majority of prisoners were unable to produce sputum and therefore were not evaluated by diagnostic tools such as GeneXpert, culture, and smear testing. A re-assessment of the tuberculosis burden is urgently needed in this setting as well as an assessment of the feasibility and value of non-sputum-based diagnostic tools to increase case detection and reduce ongoing transmission. Dr. Martinez proposes to: (1) measure the prevalence of undiagnosed TB and characteristics of tuberculosis among Brazilian prisoners who are unable to provide sputum samples at the baseline screening visit; (2) determine the feasibility and sensitivity of Mask Aerosol Sampling system (MASS), a novel tool that directly captures exhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis from patients, during a mass screening intervention; and (3) identify cost-effective algorithms for tuberculosis screening in prisons. The proposed project will leverage an NIH-funded R01 study (AI130058-01, PI, Andrews/Croda) by the primary mentors, which is ongoing and enrolls adults in several prisons located in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. This research plan forms the basis of a 5-year career development plan for Dr. Martinez under the mentorship of Drs. Jason Andrews (infectious diseases, epidemiology), Julie Parsonnet (adult infectious diseases), Julio Croda (infectious diseases, health policy), Yvonne Maldonado (pediatric infectious diseases), and Upinder Singh (infectious diseases) with consultants Robert Horsburgh (clinical epidemiology), Michael Barer (tuberculosis diagnostics), and Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert (cost-effectiveness analyses). This interdisciplinary group has developed a career development program for Dr. Martinez that includes: (1) fostering skills in designing field-based research and data collection; (2) application of statistical methods for the study of novel diagnostics; (3) effective usage of and experience with new advanced statistical methodologies related to decision-tree algorithmic creation, cost- effectiveness analysis, and mathematical modeling; (4) regular meetings with mentors and consultants; (5) presenting results at scientific meetings and seminars; (6) publishing in peer-reviewed journals; and (7) writing and submitting an R01 grant. Completion of this career development plan will allow Dr. Martinez to successfully compete for extramural funding in the future to continue researching non-sputum-based tuberculosis diagnostics in high-risk populations. Project Narrative. Increasing tuberculosis case detection, especially in high-risk groups, is critical to meet the World Health Organization’s End TB Strategy to reduce tuberculosis incidence by 90% globally by 2035. A significant barrier to achieving this goal is that a large proportion of patients are unable to produce sputum and are therefore are not evaluated with commonly used and recommended diagnostics such as GeneXpert, culture, and smear testing. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify and quantify the burden of undiagnosed tuberculosis in Brazilian prisoners, evaluate the feasibility and value of non-sputum-based diagnostics to improve case detection in this setting, and to identify cost-effective algorithms for tuberculosis screening in prisons.",Identifying effective and efficient approaches to tuberculosis screening in Brazilianprisons,10105242,K01AI156022,"['Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Algorithms', 'Brazil', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Contracts', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhalation', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Health Policy', 'Imprisonment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Masks', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Natural History', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prisoner', 'Prisons', 'Program Development', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'case finding', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'point of care', 'programs', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NIAID,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K01,2021,128574
"Malarial retinopathy screening system for improved diagnosis of cerebral malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. In 2018, malaria affected more than 213 million people in Africa alone and claimed 381,000 lives, more than 65% of whom were African children less than 5 years old. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM, incorrect treatment, and resulting mortality or neurological disability. The specificity of the current standard of care for clinical diagnosis of CM (physical symptoms, coma, and malaria parasite test such as rapid diagnostic testing) is reported around 61%. Therefore, there is a significant market need for a highly specific, low-cost, and easy-to-use test to improve CM diagnosis and save lives. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 95% specific to the presence of CM, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. Screening for MR in addition to the current standard of care improves the specificity of CM diagnosis from 61% to 100%. VisionQuest Biomedical has developed ASPIRE, the first fully automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera, a system that can be operated by minimally trained personnel such as medical technician or nurse without the need of an ophthalmic specialist. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of regulatory consultants, commercialization experts, business development specialists, and clinicians; to clinically deploy and launch ASPIRE in our target market in Africa. This team will validate and prepare ASPIRE for regulatory clearance as well as finalize the marketing and commercial rollout strategy. In Phase II-B, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical deployed a fully-functional clinical version of ASPIRE and tested it in nine malaria clinics in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In CRP, ASPIRE will be validated for technical and clinical performance and will be brought to commercial readiness with regulatory clearance. We will accomplish this through four specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be validated to bring it under design controls. In the second aim, we will deploy ASPIRE at 25 clinics in Africa to demonstrate safety and efficacy as well as to promote market traction. The third aim will focus on preparing ASPIRE for regulatory submission. In the fourth aim, we will complete African healthcare market research for a startup market of 5 countries (Malawi, Zambia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda) and finalize marketing and rollout strategy. Within one year after CRP, our goal will be to deploy ASPIRE in more than 200 malaria clinics across 5 countries in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which claims hundreds of thousands of lives of African children every year. The detection of retinal biomarkers of CM, called malarial retinopathy, can improve the diagnostic accuracy of CM. This project proposes the development, clinical deployment, and commercialization of a fully automated malarial retinopathy detection system consisting of a low-cost retinal camera and automatic malarial retinopathy detection software.",Malarial retinopathy screening system for improved diagnosis of cerebral malaria,10253474,SB1AI162452,"['5 year old', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Businesses', 'Cerebral Malaria', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coma', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Country', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Market', 'Human Resources', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Internet', 'Kenya', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Malaria', 'Malawi', 'Market Research', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Neurologic', 'Nurses', 'Parasites', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Rwanda', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Software Validation', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Uganda', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Zambia', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical research site', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'detection platform', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'improved', 'malaria infection', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'physical symptom', 'portability', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'screening', 'smartphone Application', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'success', 'usability', 'verification and validation', 'web site']",NIAID,VISIONQUEST BIOMEDICAL INC,SB1,2021,999158
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,10215413,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'community clinic', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'health care service organization', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2021,749164
"Spectral precision imaging for early diagnosis of colorectal lesions with CT colonography Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, even though it could be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, the current standard of cathartic bowel preparation for CTC and optical colonoscopy (OC) is poorly tolerated by patients and has been recognized as a major barrier to colorectal examinations. Our advanced non-cathartic multi-center computer-assisted CTC trial showed that non-cathartic CTC is easily tolerated by patients and that radiologists who use computer-aided detection (CADe) can detect large polyps in size in non-cathartic CTC with high sensitivity, comparable to that of OC. However, SF6-lesions (serrated lesions, flat lesions <3 mm in height, and polyps 6 – 9 mm in size) were a significant source of false negatives in the trial. The challenges of detection and visualization of these SF6-lesions in non-cathartic CTC are caused largely by the inability of the current single-energy CTC technique to differentiate between soft tissues, fecal tagging, and their partial volumes with lumen air. We propose to employ multi-spectral CTC precision imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome these inherent limitations of non-cathartic CTC. Our goal in this project is to develop a novel deep-learning AI (DEEP-AI) scheme for multi-spectral multi-material (MUSMA) precision imaging, which will use deep super-learning of high-quality spectral CTC (spCTC) precision images to boost the diagnostic performance of non-cathartic CTC. We hypothesize that (1) high-quality MUSMA precision images can be reconstructed from ultra-low-dose (<1 mSv) spCTC scans, (2) DEEP-AI will yield a detection sensitivity for ≥6 mm SF6-lesions comparable to that of OC, and that (3) the use of DEEP-AI as first reader will significantly improve radiologists’ detection performance for SF6-lesions and reduce interpretation time compared with unaided reading, and that it will yield a detection accuracy comparable to that of OC. Our specific aims are (1) to establish a non-cathartic spCTC and MUSMA precision image database, (2) to develop a DEEP-AI Interpretation System for visualization and detection of SF6-lesions, and (3) to evaluate the clinical benefit of the DEEP-AI Interpretation System with non-cathartic spCTC cases. Successful development of the proposed DEEP-AI Interpretation System will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of SF6-lesions from non-cathartic CTC examinations that address the problem of patient adherence to colorectal screening guidelines. Such a scheme will make non-cathartic CTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, leading to an increased colorectal screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer. Project Narrative Although colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, it could be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Successful development of the proposed deep-learning artificial intelligence scheme will substantially improve human readers’ performance in detecting colorectal polyps from non-cathartic CTC examinations that addresses the problem of patient adherence to colorectal screening guidelines. Such a scheme will make non-cathartic CTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, leading to an increased colorectal screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer.",Spectral precision imaging for early diagnosis of colorectal lesions with CT colonography,10054168,R01CA212382,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Air', 'American Cancer Society', 'American College of Radiology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Catharsis', 'Cathartics', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Assisted', 'Contrast Media', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intestines', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Medicare', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Oral Ingestion', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Preventive service', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'computer aided detection', 'computer center', 'deep learning', 'detection sensitivity', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older patient', 'prevent', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'soft tissue', 'spectrograph', 'virtual']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,120631
"Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia Project Summary/Abstract: The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with transdisciplinary expertise in cancer epidemiology, biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation. The focused didactic training, mentorship, and experiential learning through research activities proposed in this award will facilitate the development of critical skills in the pursuit of knowledge to inform and improve cancer prevention and screening. The candidate's research is motivated by the recognition that type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at a 30-40% increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), and that anti-diabetic drugs may also alter CRC risk. Thus, this high-risk group presents an opportunity for targeted screening and early detection of CRC. Currently, CRC screening is based on age and family history, with no consideration for comorbidities, including T2DM. Building on her previous work in cancer epidemiology, the candidate seeks to determine the association between T2DM and risk of colorectal polyps: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity, individually reflecting different molecular pathways (Aim 1); and to examine the risk for colorectal polyps associated with anti-diabetic therapy: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity (Aim 2). These aims will be addressed by leveraging the rich resources of an existing colonoscopy- based cohort at the University of Washington Medical Center's (UWMC) Gastroenterology clinic established during 2003-2011. Demographics, select lifestyle factors, and detailed histopathology have been previously abstracted from UWMC's electronic medical records (EMR) database. The candidate proposes to extend this cohort through 2017 (N~38,000), and enhance it by linking existing data with diabetes-related variables from the EMR database using biomedical informatics (e.g., natural language processing, clinical text mining) to estimate the risk for colorectal neoplasia. Using these empirical estimates derived from Aims 1 and 2, the candidate will then build a microsimulation model projecting the risk for colorectal neoplasia in T2DM patients, accounting for their diabetes therapy. Alternative screening and treatment strategies, including altering the screening start-age, modifying diabetes treatment, or altering screening modality among T2DM patients, will be evaluated for their cost-effectiveness (Aim 3). This work may help inform targeted screening recommendations that could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening. The candidate has proposed a training and career development plan that builds upon her prior skills in cancer epidemiology to gain experience and proficiency in biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation, including cost-effectiveness approaches. The transdisciplinary mentorship team, comprised of national and international experts, will provide the necessary expertise to ensure the success of this proposal, as well as facilitate the candidate's transition into an independent translational investigator in the field of cancer prevention and screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to determine the link between clinically diagnosed type-2 diabetes mellitus, use of anti-diabetic medications, and risk of colorectal polyp subtypes, including differences by lesion severity. Evaluating the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening among persons with type-2 diabetes may help inform targeted screening recommendations, which could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening.","Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia",10237250,K07CA222060,"['Accounting', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Award', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Models', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Family', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metformin', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Smoking History', 'Subgroup', 'Sulfonylurea Compounds', 'Testing', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer prevention', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'demographics', 'diabetes mellitus therapy', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'economic evaluation', 'experience', 'health economics', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'mortality', 'non-diabetic', 'personalized screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'skills', 'success', 'text searching', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K07,2021,158153
"Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography Abstract Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and a leading cause of cancer mortality. Early detection of breast cancer can reduce mortality and morbidity, which has led to widespread mammography screening, recommended for women ages 50-74 on a yearly or bi-yearly basis. Reading the mammogram images to decide if cancer may be present is difficult due to the rarity of occurrence – in a screening population, 99.5% of women do not have cancer – and the visual challenge of finding what can be a very subtle abnormality on a complex background. This difficulty, combined with the high volume of mammograms – 39 million per year in the US – has led to a variety of proffered solutions including software known as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Despite early promise, such solutions have not fulfilled their potential in improving outcomes and are largely thought to increase interpretation times. Productivity is increasingly a concern due to the rapidly growing use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT or “3D” mammography), which has demonstrated higher cancer detection rates than traditional 2D mammography, but also takes much longer to interpret. As a potential solution, there has been significant interest in applying deep learning to mammography. Deep learning (DL) is a powerful field of machine learning which learns image features in an end-to-end fashion from data, and has been used to achieve human level performance on a number of imaging pattern recognition tasks. This proposal seeks to create DL-based software for mammography that can be effective in a clinical setting through (1) accurate and robust predictions on a diverse population of patients, (2) interpretable results from the DL model (no “black box” answers), and (3) applicability to both 2D mammography and DBT. In Phase I, the aim is to improve model performance by training on additional data and incorporating additional algorithmic advances. Phase I will conclude with a clinical reader study comparing performance of the software to radiologists. In Phase II, the aim is to improve the clinical effectiveness of the software by automating quality detection, incorporating prior exams into the model, and expanding the training dataset to ensure results generalize to any woman eligible for screening mammography. These improvements will apply to both 2D and DBT. Achieving the desired performance levels will enable a product that will improve productivity for radiologists and ensure consistent and accurate interpretations for patients. Success in this project would be a large step towards translating state-of- the-art artificial intelligence to clinically effective tools for screening mammography. Project Narrative Though mammography screening is widely considered beneficial for women ages 50-74, the varied challenges with reading the images lead to missed cancers or over-diagnosis, which in turn result in shorter length of life or unnecessary invasive procedures for many women. The goal of this project is use recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to create a tool for doctors that will help them interpret mammograms more accurately and efficiently. These improvements will enable better outcomes for women by improving access to quality mammography interpretations, especially in resource-constrained areas.",Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography,10163142,R44CA240022,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asians', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Callback', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis', 'Digital Mammography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'clinical development', 'commercialization', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'success', 'symposium', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'underserved area']",NCI,"DEEPHEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,927817
"Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY Screening mammography saves lives but human interpretation alone is imperfect and is associated with significant harms including ~30,000 missed breast cancers and ~3.8 million false-positives exams each year in the U.S. alone. Traditional computer-aided detection failed to improve screening accuracy, in part due to the static nature of software trained and tested on small datasets decades ago. Recent advances in improved computer processing power, cloud-based data storage capabilities, and availability of large imaging datasets have led to renewed excitement for applying artificial intelligence (AI) to mammography interpretation. We propose a unique academic-industry partnership to validate, refine, scale, and clinically translate our proven 2D mammography AI algorithm to 3D mammography interpretation. Our team helped organize and lead the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) Digital Mammography Challenge, an open crowdsourced AI algorithmic challenge that provided >640,000 digital 2D mammogram images and associated clinical metadata to >1,200 coding teams worldwide. Our industry partner for this grant, DeepHealth, Inc., was the top performing team in the DREAM Challenge. With >50% of U.S. facilities now offering 3D mammography for screening, the 50-to-100-fold increase in imaging data represents a new critical barrier for both radiologists and AI algorithm developers. To date, there have been few publications addressing AI-enhanced interpretation of 3D mammography, the emerging screening exam of choice. We will validate our post-DREAM algorithm for 2D mammography (which currently rivals human interpretation alone) using UCLA's Athena Breast Health Network, one of the largest population-based breast imaging registries. We will enhance our 2D AI algorithm with expert radiologist supervision and examine the impact of adding novel non-imaging data parameters, including genetic mutation and tumor molecular subtype data, to help train the AI model to identify more clinically significant cancers. We will use several novel technical algorithmic approaches to scale from 2D to 3D mammography which, in our preliminary studies, have shown improved accuracy beyond radiologist interpretation alone. Finally, we will perform a series of interpretive studies to identify the optimal interface between “black box” outputs and radiologist interpreters, which remains an understudied topic. With >40 million U.S. women undergoing screening each year, seemingly small improvements in overall accuracy would still imply significantly improved population-based outcomes. In summary, we have assembled an unparalleled multidisciplinary team with expertise in machine/deep learning, breast cancer screening accuracy, medicine, oncology, radiology, imaging technology assessment, and biostatistics. We have a proven track record of strong collaboration and are well positioned to validate, enhance, scale, and translate our proven 2D AI algorithm for improved 3D mammography accuracy. Our new end user tool will help tip the balance of routine screening towards greater benefits than harms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current interpretation of screening mammography suffers from human limitations, leading to approximately 30,000 missed cancers and 3.8 million false positives exams every year in the U.S. alone. Our multidisciplinary team of experts on breast cancer screening, machine and deep learning, data science, and imaging technology assessment will validate our highly accurate 2D mammography artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that was the best performer in an international competition with >1,200 participants and then further enhance it with novel AI augmentation methods. We will then apply innovative techniques to scale the AI algorithm from 2D to 3D mammography, addressing the issue of a 50-to-100-fold increase in volumetric data with 3D exams, and then clinically translate our optimized AI 3D mammography tool through a series of interpretive accuracy studies involving experienced and inexperienced radiologists from both academic and community practices.","Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation",10075243,R37CA240403,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'California', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Community Practice', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis', 'Digital Mammography', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Institution', 'International', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publications', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'algorithm development', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'computer aided detection', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'experience', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'long short term memory', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prospective', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R37,2021,528811
"Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response. PROJECT SUMMARY Precision oncology relies on the hypothesis that further characterizing a patient's tumor will lead to better predictions of treatment response. While this approach effectively breaks diagnoses into smaller and smaller subtypes likely to respond to a given targeted inhibitor, the downside is it results in highly fragmented clinical data spread across multiple treatment arms. The more progress the field makes in assigning new therapies, the harder it will be to accrue adequate sample size to test another therapy. Direct screening of cancer cell lines and primary samples on panels of targeted inhibitors is a uniquely promising approach to this problem, turning every patient sample into a hundred mini experiments, but clinical validation of in vitro drug-response predictions have been hampered by limited numbers of patients who are screened and actually treated with any given drug. Such an evaluation is critical to determine the predictive value gained from drug screening of patient samples. Over the past seven years the Knight Cancer Institute has performed drug screening paired alongside genomic and/or RNA sequencing for over 600 primary leukemic samples. Within two years, we will have accumulated over 200 patients not only screened for in vitro drug response but then treated with matched targeted inhibitors. I will leverage this existing and growing dataset to interrogate the power of in vitro drug screening data to predict clinical response using retrospective data. I will establish a robust framework for primary drug screening and analysis, build interpretable models for clinical decision making, and explore mechanisms controlling drug response. This project will result in improvements to high-throughput drug screening, a thorough accounting of the predictive power of in vitro drug screening, and candidates for treatment combinations in resistant tumors. My goal is to become an independent investigator and cross-disciplinary leader in patient sample multi-omic profiling, targeted therapy selection, and translational oncology. During my mentored phase I will be receiving guidance from Dr. Emek Demir, an expert in computational modeling of systems biology, Dr. Jeffery Tyner, a leader in patient sample drug screening and validation, and Dr. Brian Druker, a pioneer of targeted cancer therapy and director of the Knight Cancer Institute. I will also improve my statistical understanding of complex systems by working with my advisory committee member Dr Tomi Mori, learn to integrate large datasets and predicting patient outcomes from Dr. Shannon McWeeney, and improve upon existing drug screening platforms and analysis methods with Dr. Laura Heiser. I am determined to attain an independent faculty position and my mentors have committed to assisting me in the application and transition process. PROJECT NARRATIVE A promising field of cancer treatment is targeted therapy, where each patient is prescribed different drugs precisely based on the features of their cancer. We have a large dataset of patients where we tested drugs on their cancer cells in the lab, and later the patient received the same drug as part of their therapy. I will investigate the best methods for testing drugs on each patient's cancer, how effective these tests are for predicting how well a treatment will work in each patient, and why some patients don't see the benefit from targeted therapy we normally expect.",Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response.,10092124,K99CA245896,"['ABL1 gene', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aftercare', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Committee Members', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Screening', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'German population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'care outcomes', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'conventional therapy', 'design', 'drug response prediction', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high-throughput drug screening', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'large datasets', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model design', 'multiple omics', 'multitask', 'new combination therapies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'phosphoproteomics', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'response', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'survival prediction', 'targeted agent', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'validation studies']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,137956
"Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) confers elevated risk for progression to EAC. Patients diagnosed with BE undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy with biopsies to detect dysplasia which can be treated by endoscopic eradication with radiofrequency ablation before it progresses to EAC. However, the majority of diagnosed EAC patients have not had prior screening endoscopy and present with advanced lesions that limit treatment options and result in poorer survival. The development of a rapid, low cost, well tolerated, non-endoscopic BE screening technique that can be performed in unsedated patients at points of care outside the endoscopy suite would improve BE detection and reduce EAC morbidity and mortality. Our program is a multidisciplinary collaboration among investigators at the Massachusetts Institute Technology and Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System / Harvard Medical School that integrates novel optical imaging and software design, preclinical studies in swine, clinical studies in patients, and advanced image processing / machine learning. Aim 1 will develop an omniview tethered capsule technology that generates a map of the esophageal mucosa over a multi-centimeter length of esophagus and a series of wide angle forward views to aid navigation as the capsule is swallowed or retracted. The images will resemble endoscopic white light or narrow band imaging, but will not suffer from perspective distortion present in standard endoscopic or video capsule images. This will facilitate development of automated BE detection algorithms as well as enhance their sensitivity and specificity. This aim will also perform imaging studies in swine as a translational step toward clinical studies. Aim 2 will determine reader sensitivity and specificity for BE detection versus standard endoscopy / biopsy and prepare data for developing automated BE detection. Patients undergoing screening as well as with history of BE undergoing surveillance will be recruited and unsedated capsule imaging will be performed on the same day prior to their endoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting BE will be assessed using multiple blinded readers and data sets suitable for developing automated BE detection algorithms will be developed. Aim 3 will develop image analysis methods for automated BE detection by investigating classifiers that operate on handcrafted features (colors and textures) and modern deep convolutional neural network methods for direct classification. If successful, this program will develop a rapid, low cost and scalable method for BE screening that would not require patient sedation, endoscopy, or tissue acquisition, and which could be performed in community primary care clinics. The procedure would be much faster and many times lower cost than endoscopy. Automated BE detection would enable immediate results for patient consultation and referral to gastroenterology if indicated. Larger patient populations with expanded risk criteria could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing EAC mortality. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. The program proposes to develop an omniview tethered capsule technology, examination protocol, and automated analysis methods for low cost, rapid, well tolerated, and scalable screening in order to facilitate monitoring and timely treatment.

"Comparative Modeling of Effective Policies for Colorectal Cancer Control ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The long-term goal of our proposed project is to reduce the population burden of CRC by providing the information needed to address key policy questions across the CRC control continuum in an accessible and transparent manner. To accomplish this goal we will use our population-based microsimulation models to: 1) Evaluate the impact of screening as practiced in the US; 2) Inform the debate about the increase in CRC incidence before age 50; 3) Consider the effectiveness of precision of screening and surveillance; 4) Address other emerging issues and opportunities in CRC control; and 5) Use novel methods to improve model accessibility and transparency. Our team will fill critical gaps in knowledge, enabling decision makers to act. New evidence that we will incorporate in our models to better inform CRC control opportunities will be 1) updated information on screening patterns in the US (in collaboration with the Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimen, or PROSPR), 2) data on the increased risk of CRC in persons under age 50 (in collaboration with Rebecca Siegal of the American Cancer Society, who did the seminal work in this area), and 3) state-of-the art colonoscopy screening data to incorporate alternative carcinogenesis pathways in the natural history models (in collaboration with the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry). We will synthesize and incorporate the growing body of evidence in the literature to assess the clinical utility of personalized screening and treatment, as well as the potential role for novel computer-aided detection and diagnosis modalities. We will expand our models to project clinical and resource-based outcomes for middle-income countries that are considering the implementation of a screening program. Lastly, there is a critical need to make our models assessible and transparent. To this end we will use high performance computing approaches to develop and apply deep- learning methods for model calibration and model emulation, which will aid in model sharing. The three participating modeling groups are well positioned to carry out this work, bringing a wealth of experience, expertise, and insight to issues related to microsimulation modeling of CRC, and have a proven track record of collaboration and disseminating our work to health policy decision makers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite large increases in screening in the past two decades, colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States.

"Automated Digital Imaging for Cervical Cancer Screening Project Abstract/Summary: Cervical cancer screening programs remain essential to reduce cervical cancer in women despite the availability of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines. Screening is important for all women but is particularly important for women living with HIV given the high prevalence of HPV in this group and risks associated with progression notwithstanding antiretroviral therapy. Here we propose to investigate the clinical utility of a new method of automated digital imaging of the cervix on the MobileODT platform as a screen-and-treat approach. We build on a long-term collaboration between the University of Cape Town and Columbia University investigating how to strengthen cervical cancer screening and treatment in South Africa. Currently, screen-and-treat programs utilizing HPV DNA testing are recommended by the World Health Organization. We have demonstrated the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach for the South African setting with its high HIV prevalence in women. In this setting, we are currently completing an NCI- supported study demonstrating the feasibility and outstanding performance of an HPV DNA assay that can be used at the point-of-care for a single-visit, screen-and-treat program. Here we propose to extend this work to investigate in Specific Aim 1: the performance characteristics of automated digital imaging as a standalone, primary screening test to replace HPV DNA testing for use in the single-visit, screen-and-treat approach; Specific Aim 2: the performance characteristics of automated digital imaging as a triage test for women who test HPV DNA positive in the screen- and-treat approach; and Specific Aim 3: facility-level operational challenges and facilitators to integrating this new imaging technology into single-visit screen-and-treat programs. We propose to undertake the studies to address these aims among women living with and without HIV at clinical sites in Cape Town, South Africa. Our overall goal is to strengthen cervical cancer screening approaches to reduce cost and improve the effectiveness of screening. Project Narrative We propose to investigate the accuracy and implementation potential of a new technology that provides an automated and almost instant classification of cervical cancer precursor lesions based on a cloud-based, machine-learning algorithm of an image of the cervix.

"Development of a biomarker panel for screening and early detection of gynecological cancers PROJECT SUMMARY It is estimated that more than 80,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian (OvCA) and endometrial (EndoCA) cancers this year in the U.S. and this will result in the death of 26,000 women. There are no screening tests for either of these two female-specific cancers which also disproportionally affect ethnically distinct populations. For both cancers, detection of early stage, localized disease is associated with 5-year survival rates in excess of 90%, while diagnosis with late stage, metastatic disease results in dramatically reduced 5-year survival rates of ~25%. MDDx, Inc. has been leveraging access to >12 years of longitudinally collected and deeply annotated biobanked plasma samples from the Gynecologic Cancer Translational Research Program (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; New York, NY and Nuvance Health; Danbury, CT) to identify tumor-associated autoantibodies (AAb) that could serve as diagnostic biomarkers. By performing AAb profiling against the entire human proteome and applying our novel machine-learning based method for classification of molecular profiles we have determined that classification signatures of <20 biomarkers can differentiate between women: 1. with and without cancer with accuracies of ~90% or higher (area under receiver operating curve, AUROC=0.92), 2. with OvCA vs EndoCA (AUROC=0.97), and 3. type I vs II EndoCA subtypes. This current approach requires that each patient is screened using the 21,000 protein array, which while powerful, would be prohibitively expensive and inefficient, and complicates the process of assigning a risk score; however, our data indicates that there is a minimum and common set of ~100 biomarkers that could be used for screening all women. This STTR program aims to refine our current platform into an affordable, easy-to-use, high confidence biomarker panel that can be used to screen all perimenopausal and older women as well as those with known risk factors for these two cancers. The goal of this Phase I STTR proposal is to select the optimized set of AAbs required to assign a high specificity risk score and perform preliminary validation of this diagnostic panel. In Aim 1 we will expand our proprietary database of plasma autoantibodies to ensure that we have a sample size (~650) that will enable us to confidently apply our machine learning approaches to identifying the minimal panel of AAbs for the diagnostic. We will use this enhanced database to identify a prototype panel of ~200 AAbs for construction of classification scoring functions to distinguish between cancer and no cancer, as well as OvCA vs. EndoCA, and type I vs II EndoCA. In Aim 2 we will perform a blinded validation and performance study using an independent set of 200 biobanked blood samples of women with and without these cancers to identify the minimal panel of ~100 biomarkers for large scale prospective validation in Phase II. Successful completion of this Phase I program will identify the optimized panel of AAbs for an affordable, laboratory-based screening test to enable identification and provide actionable management recommendations for asymptomatic women with high specificity risk scores for OvCA and EndoCA when they are still curable. PROJECTIVE NARRATIVE There are no screening tests to detect ovarian and endometrial cancers, two cancers which will be diagnosed in nearly 80,000 women in the United States this year and will lead to the death of 26,000 women. MDDx is developing an affordable, easy-to-use, high confidence diagnostic test that can be used to screen all perimenopausal women and older, as well as those with known risk factors for these cancers. Such a test will enable early detection, dramatically reducing health care costs associated with late-stage cancer surgery and care and will save lives and improve quality of life for all women facing these devastating diseases.",Development of a biomarker panel for screening and early detection of gynecological cancers,10139681,R41CA257115,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Autoantibodies', 'Baltimore', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Rate', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endometrial Carcinoma', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Female genitalia', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Localized Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perimenopause', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Array', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer care', 'cancer risk', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer surgery', 'cancer type', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic panel', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'older women', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial disparity', 'reproductive tract', 'screening', 'screening panel', 'translational research program', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,"MDDX, INC.",R41,2021,399972
"Noninvasive bladder cancer diagnostics via machine learning analysis of nanoscale surface images of epithelial cells extracted from voided urine samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is common cancer with an estimated 81,190 new cases and 17,240 deaths in 2018 (with > 500,000 survivors) only in the US. The gold standard for diagnosis of bladder cancer includes an invasive optical bladder examination (cystoscopy) and tumor resection for pathology examination. Because of a high recurrence rate of this cancer (50-80%), frequent (once every 3-6-12 months) costly and invasive cystoscopy exams are required to monitor patients for recurrence and/or progression to a more advanced stage. It makes bladder cancer the most expensive cancer to monitor/follow up and treat per patient. Moreover, the invasive nature of the current standard of care, cystoscopy, causes rather low compliance of patient to follow this procedure. There is an urgent unmet need for a bladder cancer screening and monitoring test, which will be noninvasive, rapid, objective, reproducible, easy to perform and interpret, and highly accurate. Such a test will reduce the need in frequent cystoscopies and greatly expand the participation of patients in screening and early detection programs because it decreases the patient discomfort and post-procedural complications.  Here we propose to develop such a test for identification of the presence of bladder cancer and its aggressiveness (grade). It will be based on non-invasive analysis of individual cells extracted from urine (extraction technology already exists in hospitals for voided urine cytology tests, (VUC) the current standard-of- care, a non-invasive examination of cells in urine used to assist with cancer diagnosis and surveillance). A novel modality of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) will be used for nanoscale imaging of cells extracted from urine, mapping/imaging of the physical properties of the cell surface. The collected images will further be analyzed using machine-learning methods and novel advanced statistical approaches to identify a “digital signature” of cancer. The proposed technology is fundamentally different from previously studied urine biomarkers and all existing physical methods because it is based on the analysis of physical properties of the cell surface, not cell bulk or presence of biochemical markers or genetic analysis.  Our strong preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, its presumed superiority compared to the currently used non-invasive methods, and lead us to the central hypothesis that bladder cancer can be identified by analyzing a small number of cells randomly chosen from urine samples, with a low sampling error. This is a substantial departure from VUC tests, which require a visual analysis of many cells. Supported by the preliminary data, we propose (1) to optimize and expand the method, (2) to define the accuracy of cancer detection on a large cohort of patients, and (3) to assess the accuracy of identification of aggressiveness (low versus high grade) of bladder cancer.  Our long-term goal is to develop a non-invasive clinical method for accurate detecting of presence and monitoring bladder cancer as well as many other cancers, in which cells can be extracted from easily accessible bodily fluids without the need for tissue biopsy (e.g urine-bladder & upper urinary tract cancer, stool- colorectal cancer, sputum-aerodigestive cancer, cervical smears-cervical cancer etc.), using methods based on the analysis of physical characteristics of the cell surface. The proposed research, which is the first step in pursuit of this overarching goal. NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel, noninvasive, and sensitive bladder cancer screening test using cells found in voided urine samples that are imaged with ultra-high-resolution atomic force microscopy. The proposed method will improve the current standard-of-care cytological evaluation of voided urine test (VUC) to detect bladder cancer with higher accuracy, and further help to identify the grade of cancer. We anticipate this innovative technology will remarkably improve patient participation for screening and follow-up on bladder cancer, and confidently nominate patients for the more invasive and expensive detection using cystoscopies.",Noninvasive bladder cancer diagnostics via machine learning analysis of nanoscale surface images of epithelial cells extracted from voided urine samples,10276838,R01CA262147,"['Adhesions', 'Atomic Force Microscopy', 'Benign', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Bladder', 'Body Fluids', 'Burning Pain', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cervical Smears', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Confusion', 'Control Groups', 'Cystoscopy', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysuria', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Feces', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematuria', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Oncology', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Optics', 'Pathology', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Screening for cancer', 'Sputum', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Surface Properties', 'Survivors', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urine', 'Urologic Cancer', 'Urology', 'Urothelium', 'Visual', 'Work', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cell fixation', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'genetic analysis', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'microscopic imaging', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'physical property', 'programs', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'screening participation', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'ultra high resolution', 'viscoelasticity']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2021,674628
"Mobile oral cancer screening system for low-resource settings Two-thirds of oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the 5-year survival rate is only 10-40. Enough is already known about the disease and its prevention for action to be taken. The poor survival rate in LMICs is mainly due to late diagnosis. Therefore, it is imperative to detect precursor and malignant lesions early and expeditiously. To meet the need for technologies that enable oral cancer screening and diagnosis in low resource settings (LRS), Light Research Inc (LRI) will develop, validate, and commercialize a low-cost smartphone-based imaging system that provides remote specialist access and triage decision-making guidance tailored to non-specialist use in LRS. To achieve the project goal, LRI will license technologies from University of Arizona (UA), and partner with UA and Mazumdar-Shaw Cancer Center (MSCC) (Bangalore, India) to develop and validate a multimodal mobile oral imaging system for oral cancer detection and diagnosis in LRS. In the past few years, the project team has developed and evaluated a dual-mode (polarized white light imaging [pWLI]) and autofluorescence imaging [AFI])) mobile imaging device that specifically addresses critical barriers in LRS to improve oral cancer screening. To address one of the key hurdles in adopting optical imaging techniques for oral cancer screening in LRS, the team has also developed and evaluated cloud-based and mobile-based deep learning image classification methods for guiding patient triage. Since the key techniques proposed in this mobile imaging system have been successfully evaluated for oral cancer screening with 3,000 high-risk population in LRS, the potential of successfully transitioning it to the low- resource regions for accurate, objective and location-resolved detection of oral cancer is very high. The project objective will be achieved through three Aims: (1) to optimize a mobile intraoral imaging system for LRS, (2) to optimize deep learning-based dual-modality image classification methods, and (3) to validate the clinical usefulness of the mobile oral imaging system for oral cancer screening and triage in LSR. Successful completion of this project will lead to a mobile oral imaging system with deep learning image classification method that delivers urgently-needed capabilities to the end users in LRS. LRI will partner with Jana Care Inc (New Delhi, India) for low-cost production, with Ergo Healthcare (Mumbai, India) for product distribution in south and southeast Asian, and with DentalEZ Group for product distribution in America and Europe. The use of this mobile-based screening approach for early detection and triage of oral cancers will eventually improve oral cancer detection rates, treatment outcomes, and quality of life of patients in LRS. Project Narrative Light Research Inc (LRI) will develop and commercialize a mobile oral imaging system to address the urgent need of a low-cost, portable, easy to use, and reliable imaging device and deep learning image classification method for oral cancer screening in low resource settings (LRS). It is expected that this mobile based dual- modality screening approach for early detection and triage of oral cancers will eventually improve detection rates, treatment outcomes, and quality of life of patients.",Mobile oral cancer screening system for low-resource settings,10323692,R44CA265514,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Americas', 'Arizona', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Europe', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'India', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Participant', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Screening for Oral Cancer', 'Solid', 'South Asian', 'Specialist', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'community setting', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk population', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'imaging system', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intraoral probe', 'low and middle-income countries', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural network architecture', 'optical imaging', 'oral care', 'oral lesion', 'portability', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'remote diagnosis', 'rural area', 'screening', 'social', 'southeast Asian', 'standard of care', 'tongue root']",NCI,"LIGHT RESEARCH, INC.",R44,2021,952904
"SBIR Phase I - Topic 402 -  Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring Retinoblastoma is a rare pediatric cancer affecting the retina, optic nerve, and brain. Accounting for 6% of all cancers in children under the age of five, it is the world's most common primary intraocular childhood malignancy. While survival rates in the U.S. are high, early detection is pivotal to preserving vision: by the time symptoms present, enucleation is often the only option. This proposal seeks to develop IRIS-R, an Intelligent Retinal Imaging Solution to enable earlier detection of Retinoblastoma. This inexpensive, noninvasive screening tool will leverage recent advances in deep learning to detect the tell-tale signs of retinal tumors in near real-time. The models will be integrated with a handheld non-mydriatic fundus imager, providing a reliable, inexpensive, hardware backbone for the screening tool. IRIS-R will be developed with help from retinal specialists, practicing ophthalmologists, and pediatricians to guarantee maximum diagnostic accuracy and clinical usefulness. n/a","SBIR Phase I - Topic 402 -  Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring",10347281,5N91020C00047,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Fundus', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optic Nerve', 'Phase', 'Retina', 'Retinal Neoplasms', 'Retinoblastoma', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'Vision', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer prevention', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fundus imaging', 'imager', 'pediatrician', 'preservation', 'retinal imaging']",NCI,BABEL ANALYTICS LLC,N43,2021,49484
