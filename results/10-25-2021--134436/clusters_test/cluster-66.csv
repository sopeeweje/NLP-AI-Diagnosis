"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT. Project Narrative Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. The short-term goal of this study is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in college-aged young adults. The relevance of the project to public health is reflected in the long-term goal, which is to construct a genetic risk profile which can be used by health-care providers and educators to identify individuals genetically at risk for chronic tinnitus.",Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,10359459,R21DC016704,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Audiology', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Professional', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Hyperacusis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industrial Arts', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Music', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Otitis Media', 'PTGS1 gene', 'PTGS2 gene', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Sodium', 'Source', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Tinnitus', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinical development', 'college', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hearing impairment', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'preventive intervention', 'relating to nervous system', 'serotonin receptor', 'serotonin transporter', 'sound', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'voltage gated channel', 'young adult']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2021,135331
"Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis Despite major advances in prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it remains a major cause of deaths worldwide. As ASCVD is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and impact on this unmet residual risk. One such human polymorphism in the ID3 gene (rs11574) was associated with ASCVD in 3 distinct human cohorts. Notably, this SNP significantly attenuates ID3 function and studies in pre-clinical models confirm a critical role for ID3 in atheroprotection. We have previously shown that loss of ID3 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and promotes VSMC expression of inflammatory factors, processes linked to increase atherosclerosis. In collaboration with Dr. Gary Owens, we have generated a mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and VSMC-specific deletion of ID3 to study ID3-dependent VSMC specific changes during the course of lesion development in the context of the whole animal. We have developed a comprehensive CyTOF panel to identify and quantitate key cellular and intracellular changes in VSMC and other lesional cells in the aorta during the course of atherosclerosis development in these mice. To translate murine findings to humans, we have utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to knock out ID3 and produce the full allelic series of rs11574 in human cells and validated a reproducible system for differentiation of human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to VSMC. We will quantify the changes in VSMC phenotype in iPSC-derived VSMC with the full allelic series of rs11574. To further translate murine findings to humans, intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH) will be measured in human coronary arteries and analyzed with cutting edge image analysis techniques in collaboration with Dr. Milan Sonka at the University of Iowa. As such, our group is uniquely poised to dissect the role of this ASCVD-associated SNP and translate findings to humans. We hypothesize: that loss of ID3 in VSMCs will inhibit VSMC growth and promote a phenotype that exacerbates vessel wall inflammation and atherosclerosis lesion development; that human ID3 encoded by the risk allele aggravates these atherogenic VSMC functions; and that human subjects with the risk allele have larger coronary plaques with increased fatty deposits, necrotic cores and calcification compared to subjects homozygous for the common allele. As atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and further impact on ASCVD morbidity and mortality. Human ID3 gene polymorphism at rs11574 is associated with ASCVD in three unique human cohorts. Preliminary data supports a key role for ID3 in vascular smooth muscle cell biology linked to ASCVD. In the current proposal, we will utilize a novel mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and specific deletion of ID3 to elucidate the role of ID3 in promoting atherogenic VSMCs. We will then utilize CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMCs to identify the VSMC processes altered by the ID3 gene mutation linked to CVD. Lastly, we will determine if this ID3 gene mutation, alone or in combination with other gene mutations are associated with the amount and type of atherosclerotic plaque in human coronary arteries as measured by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology. Results have the potential to lead to novel targeted therapy for atherosclerosis.",Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis,10210435,R01HL148109,"['Alanine', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Aorta', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Iowa', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Necrosis', 'Null Lymphocytes', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Residual state', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Threonine', 'Translating', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'calcification', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary plaque', 'dimer', 'genome editing', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oxidized low density lipoprotein', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,671017
