"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Development and analysis of new mathematical and statistical models for chronic pain Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Abrams, Daniel, M Project Description  1. Intellectual merit (see Sec. 2, pages 13-14, for ""Broader impacts"") 1.1 Introduction and background 1.1.1 General introduction During recent decades there has been an extraordinary growth in the availability of data relating to a wide range of microbiological systems. That data has enabled new quantitative approaches to biology, including the development of new mathematical and statistical models that given fun- damental insight into the workings of biological systems.  Another source is now growing explosively: biomedical data. This data has significant potential for use in treatment of human disease, but thus far comparatively fewer mathematical models for medical phenomena have been developed. The hope is that quantitative models will allow for ""personalized"" or ""precision"" medicine, where treatment protocols are customized based on an understanding of how individual patient characteristics impact the effectiveness of the treatment. Deep mathematical understanding of biomedical systems also promises to allow for optimization of medical interventions: the physical and/or financial costs of intervention could be minimized for a given desired level of benefit.  The broad goal of the proposed research is to develop new integrative mathematical models for the dynamics of subjective pain in patients suffering from chronic pain. These models will combine existing qualitative knowledge with insight gained from newly available patient data, with the goal of incorporating data streams corning on line in the near future. We plan to develop multiple models in parallel using a variety of approaches and then to select the best rnodel(s) based on agreement with objective data. 1.1.2 Background on biological application: Sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic illness associated with frequent medical complications and hospitalizations. Approximately 90% of acute care visits are for pain events, and 30-day reuti- lization rates are alarmingly high [27]. While factors influenci.ng these high re-utilization rates are poorly understood, close follow-up and continued use of pain medication has been shown to de- crease re-hospitalization rates. Mobile technology has become an integral part of health care management and Pl Shah's recently developed mobile application (SMART app - see Figure 1) for SCD assists with documentation of pain and interventions. 1.1.3 Background on hybrid approach Perhaps because of the often distinct educational backgrounds of practitioners or distinct typical applications, statistical and mechanistic approaches are not frequently combined in addressing a single problem. The majority of attempts in the scientific literature have appeared in the context of neural networks [37, 38, 29] and chemical engineering [38, 33, 11], where they largely play a computational rather than analytical role. Some attempts have also been made with medical applications: Rosenberg et al. [30] and Adams et al. [4] developed a model by combining a dy- namical systems approach with a statistical model to predict a patient's CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load over time in an HIV study. Timms et al. [39] proposed a dynamical systems approach  1 0MB No. 0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 01/18 Approved Through 03/31/2020) Page_ Continuation Format Page n/a",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Development and analysis of new mathematical and statistical models for chronic pain,10231168,R01AT010413,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Analgesics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Car Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Differential Equation', 'Documentation', 'Educational Background', 'Event', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Optimum Populations', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'acute care', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomedical data science', 'chronic pain', 'comparative', 'data streams', 'dynamic system', 'follow-up', 'health management', 'human disease', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical complication', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'neural network', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'research and development', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NCCIH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,270467
"Advancing Knowledge Discovery for Postoperative Pain Management ABSTRACT Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical as poor management can impair recovery and lead to adverse events, including prolonged opioid use and transition to chronic pain. Literature suggests significant disparities exist with regard to pain management and its quality-of-life impacts, particularly among vulnerable populations (e.g. depressed, obese and diabetics). However, there lacks risk stratification tools to identify individuals at high risk for these disparate pain outcomes. Although pain scores are routinely collected in electronic health records (EHRs), shared algorithms to utilize them for care improvement are limited. To advance the efficient and effective use of the abundant amount of electronic data now available, a common data model (CDM) is necessary: standardized structures, terminologies, and rules to represent EHR data. Using a CMD for postoperative pain research would facilitate timely evidence generation across multiple populations and settings, which can provide critical evidence to stakeholders and move the field away from pain treatment for the ‘average’ patient to pain treatment for an individual. In this grant, we propose an innovative approach to advance the systematic analysis of postoperative pain across populations. Our approach will leverage the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM to develop tools that use standardize data formats and naming conventions; OMOP has over 140 collaborating sites gloablly. We will further utilize analytical tools developed by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) on this CDM to facilitate disseminate across the research community. Our approach will develop scalable, open source risk stratification tools for adverse pain outcomes across diverse populations. We will accomplish this work in three aims. First, we will develop clinical phenotypes to identify and extract key discriminating features necessary to assess postoperative pain using EHRs. Next, we will develop pain risk stratification models using machine learning, including deep learning, methods and tools based on phenotypes developed in Aim 1. Finally, we will validate our models externally at the VA and disseminate our work through open source libraries and public websites. This project will deliver validated risk-stratification tools derived from real world evidence to identify patients at high risk for adverse pain outcomes following surgery, which can potentially reduce prescribed opioids circulating in the community– a key to curbing the opioid epidemic. NARRATIVE Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical, as poor management can impair recovery, lead to increased morbidity and decreased quality of life; yet, there are significant disparities with regard to pain and its management, particularly in vulnerable populations. The proposed research will develop evidence needed to identify patients at high risk for adverse postoperative pain outcomes. Models will be developed at a tertiary academic health center, validated at the Veterans Health Administration and disseminated to the community via a publicly available website, common data model and open source libraries.",Advancing Knowledge Discovery for Postoperative Pain Management,10165821,R01LM013362,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Adjuvant', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deposition', 'Depressed mood', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain management', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'depressed patient', 'diabetic', 'effective therapy', 'electronic data', 'fundamental research', 'health care settings', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'open source', 'open source tool', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'pain chronification', 'pain outcome', 'pain score', 'population based', 'prescription opioid', 'random forest', 'risk sharing', 'risk stratification', 'social', 'structured data', 'support vector machine', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tool development', 'unstructured data', 'web site']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,644033
"PATHWAYS TO NEW BIOMARKERS IN RECURRENT ABDOMINAL PAIN IN CHILDREN PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs; previously called Recurrent Abdominal Pain) affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. Up to 66% of children go on to have similar symptoms as adults. In children, the two most common FGIDs are functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS - essentially FAP with changes in stooling pattern). Management and treatment are hampered by lack of biomarkers to characterize and understand pathophysiologically what are phenotypically and arbitrarily defined conditions. Previous studies have evaluated IBS, not FAP, and relied primarily on retrospective symptom evaluation and utilized methodology (e.g., 16S sequencing) that limits in depth interrogation of perturbations (e.g., gut dysbiosis) reported in children and adults with IBS. Further, `omics (metabolomics, lipidomics, metaproteomics) data is largely missing from studies of FGIDs and is urgently required - our preliminary data show that it likely provides critical mechanistic insight into the links between abdominal pain symptoms and the pathobiologic alterations of gut dysbiosis, barrier dysfunction, and neuroimmune dysfunction which we and others have described in FGIDs. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that these alterations can pathobiologically discriminate FGIDs from healthy controls as well as identify disease mechanisms of pain in FGIDs. We propose to build on our previous work and use previously collected prospective abdominal pain and stooling diaries and stool samples collected from a large and well-vetted group of children with FGIDs (IBS n=133, FAP n=47) and healthy controls (HC, n=112). Our Hypothesis is that microbial community characterization and `omics profiling will provide biomarkers to differentiate FGIDs (IBS and FAP) from HC and generate insight into the genesis of pain symptoms (and stooling characteristics in IBS). Our Specific Aims are to use: 1) Global unbiased whole genome shotgun sequencing, metabolomics, lipidomics and metaproteomics (`omics) on stool samples to differentiate children with FGIDs vs HC using classifier models; Sub-Aim – explore potential differences between FAP and IBS and HC; and 2) Proprietary Texas Children's Hospital Microbiome Center reference databases and state-of-the art bioinformatics approaches (e.g., supervised learning, bipartite, Bayesian models) to identify disorder-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets within children with FGIDs: Sub-Aim 2a - Characterize the relationships between `omics and abdominal pain symptoms (and stooling symptoms in IBS). Sub-Aim 2b – Characterize the relationships between `omics and abnormal physiology (impaired barrier function, neuroimmune dysfunction). It is anticipated that this innovative, multidisciplinary study will better inform patient management and offer unique therapeutic strategies based on novel insights provided by FGID biomarkers. The goals of this application fit with NINR PA- 18-140, the recently published NINR Symptom Science Model, and the NIH Common Fund and Precision Medicine Initiatives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. There is a critical need to understand what factors contribute to pain in these disorders so that effective management and treatment strategies can be designed. The results of this proposal will provide insight into the factors responsible for abdominal pain symptoms to allow better patient-specific treatment.",PATHWAYS TO NEW BIOMARKERS IN RECURRENT ABDOMINAL PAIN IN CHILDREN,10132403,R01NR013497,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Abdominal Pain', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet therapy', 'Dietary Factors', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Feces', 'Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Neuroimmune', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Oranges', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Permeability', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Schools', 'Shotguns', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virulence Factors', 'Whole-Genome Shotgun Sequencing', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'diaries', 'dysbiosis', 'enteric infection', 'gut dysbiosis', 'gut microbiome', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lipidomics', 'metabolomics', 'metaproteomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pain symptom', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'social', 'specific biomarkers', 'stool sample', 'supervised learning', 'symptom science', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy', 'whole genome']",NINR,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,466143
"Automatic Multimodal Assessment of Pain in Dementia Project Summary/Abstract Chronic and acute pain conditions increase with aging and with age-associated conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and similar dementias, causing suffering, exacerbating diminished quality of life, and likely leading to further morbidity and increased mortality. Understanding and treatment of pain is particularly challenging among populations whose ability to communicate verbally may be impaired, among which patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are of particular importance if only because of the increased aging population. A substantial body of research suggests that methods based on nonverbal indicators of pain yield reliable and valid measurement of pain in patient with dementias. Some of this work has indicated that patients with dementia may in fact be hyper-reactive to pain, rendering the pursuit of improved techniques for assessing pain in the dementia population even more important. Existing techniques for assessing nonverbal indicators of pain have several disadvantages which limit their utility. In particular, they require human observers, are dependent on specialty training, can be laborious, and cannot be applied on a continuous basis. Advances in computer vision and machine learning have the potential to overcome some of these shortcomings. Our “parent proposal” project aims to develop advanced, automated computer-vision and machine-learning models for assessing nonverbal aspects of pain in a longitudinal cohort study of people with low back pain. This supplement proposal seeks to extend our work on the “parent grant”, which aims to “build a fully automatic, multimodal (face, head, and body movement) system to measure the occurrence and intensity of low back pain from video”. In this supplement project, these aims will be extended to older adults with dementia. We will refine the principles discovered for pain assessment in the low back pain population, extend, and evaluate their application in a sample of older adults with dementias in extended-care facilities. Participants, long-term care residents with dementia, were video-recorded during a baseline state as they were lying still on a bed or examination table and then as they underwent a standardized protocol of movements designed to identify painful areas. Participants' face, head, and body movement will be used for the development of automatic measures of the occurrence and intensity of pain. To do so, face, head, and body movement will be automatically tracked using fully- automatic methods. The tracking results will be used to train end-to-end deep- leaning based classifiers to automatically measure the occurrence and intensity of pain in older adults with dementia. To investigate the validity of the proposed classifiers, we will compare automated measurement of pain intensity to reliable and objective pain intensity coding. MANOVA will be used to quantify the relationship between the individual modalities and their combination for the measurement of the occurrence and intensity of pain in older adults with dementia. Project Narrative The present supplement proposal seeks to extend our work on the parent grant to develop automatic multimodal approaches for the measurement of pain intensity in older adults with dementia. The research holds promise to improve patient care, enhance quality of life, and to advance basic understanding of the dementias through improved pain assessment.",Automatic Multimodal Assessment of Pain in Dementia,10288413,R01NR018451,"['Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Elderly', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Long-Term Care', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinically relevant', 'data sharing', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'pain model', 'parent grant']",NINR,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,344726
"A Multimodal Approach for Monitoring Prolonged Acute Pain in Neonates Most hospitalized infants experience painful procedures as a part of their care. Repeated or prolonged exposure to pain during early life is associated with permanent changes in brain structure and function and may lead to behavioral and developmental disabilities. Caregivers recognize the need to treat pain in infants but may be reluctant to administer analgesics because of potential short- and long-term side effects. Assessing pain in this vulnerable patient population is difficult as their responses are nonspecific and vary based on developmental stage. This difficulty may lead to both over- and under-treatment of pain, placing infants at risk for permanent neurologic injury. We propose to develop models and computer algorithms to automatically and continuously assess pain in neonates based on behavioral and physiological pain indicators.  To achieve this goal, the proposal has two aims: aim 1- Continuously and synchronously record contextual, behavioral and physiological signals from neonates in the NICU while they are undergoing prolonged acute pain; aim 2 - developing a multimodal system for assessing postoperative pain in neonates. The proposed system would generate continuous and standardized pain scores comparable to those obtained by conventional nurse-derived pain scores. It would improve care outcomes by enhancing the assessment of pain while decreasing the burden of pain documentation. It can also eliminate issues of inter-rater reliability associated with conventional neonatal pain assessment. The proposed data collection plan was designed based on our preliminary results and statistical analysis. The proposed system will be evaluated using standard performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, Cohen’s kappa coefficient, or their variations.  The interdisciplinary team includes a neonatologist, Dr. Ho, who is a faculty of both USF College of Medicine and College of Nursing. She practices and oversees the clinical research projects at the Tampa General Hospital NICU (the teaching hospital for USF Health). She ensures the team’s access to the NICU patient population for enrollment. She supervises the performance of the study including nursing pain assessment, video recording, and data collection. The team also includes a professor in nursing who specializes in neonatal opioids dependence and pain, an experienced research nurse, two computer science professors, and one statistics professor. The proposed work aligns very well with the NINR’s mission “to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, and communities.” The proposed neonatal pain assessment approach will provide a tool for nurses to assess pain continuously and more accurately. Pain is one of the critical factors affecting the brain development in neonates, especially in preterm neonates, with chronic illnesses. The incidence of perterm neonates exposed to pain in high and pain assessment and management remain a primary focus of neonatal nursing research. For infants in the NICU coping with pain, the proposed nursing research will enable proper pain treatment that will also improve their long-term outcomes and development. Project Narrative Hospitalized infants may experience hundreds of painful procedures, repeated or prolonged exposure to pain during this early developmental period is associated with permanent alterations in brain structure and function. Assessing pain in this vulnerable population of patients is difficult because their responses are nonspecific and vary based on developmental stage. In this application, the investigators propose to refine and evaluate a novel automated multimodal computer aided pain assessment tool to aid in reliable diagnosis and prompt treatment of pain leading to improved outcomes.",A Multimodal Approach for Monitoring Prolonged Acute Pain in Neonates,10218273,R21NR018756,"['Acute Pain', 'Affect', 'Agitation', 'Analgesics', 'Appearance', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Crying', 'Data Collection', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatal Nursing', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Research', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Assessment Tool', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain management', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Procedures', 'Psychometrics', 'Reader', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'care burden', 'care outcomes', 'care providers', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'college', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'coping', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'multimodality', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'novel', 'pain score', 'patient population', 'preterm newborn', 'procedural pain', 'professor', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'side effect', 'sound', 'statistics', 'tool']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R21,2021,218812
"A Stress and Pain Self-management m-Health App for Adult Outpatients with Sickle Cell Disease Project Summary/Abstract Our long-term goal is to reduce stress and improve sickle cell disease (SCD) pain control with less opioid use through an intervention with self-management relaxation/distraction exercises (RDE), named You Cope, We Support (YCWS). Americans living with SCD suffer recurrent episodes of acute and chronic pain, both of which are exacerbated by stress. Building on the successes of our prior formative studies, we now propose a well- designed, appropriately powered study to test efficacy of YCWS on outcomes (pain intensity, stress intensity, opioid use) in adults with SCD. We propose to recruit 170 adults for a randomized controlled trial of the short- term (8 weeks) and long-term (6 months) effects of YCWS on outcomes (pain, stress, and opioid use). Stratified on worst pain intensity (<=5; >5), we will randomly assign patients to groups: 85 to Control (Self- monitoring of outcomes + alerts/reminders), and 85 to Experimental (Self-monitoring of outcomes + alerts/reminders + use of YCWS [RDE + Support]). We will ask participants to report outcomes daily. During weeks 1-8, we will send system-generated alerts/reminders to both groups via phone call, text, or email to facilitate data entry (both groups) and intervention use support (experimental). If the patient does not enter data after 24 hours, study support staff will contact him/her for data entry trouble-shooting (both groups) and YCWS use (experimental). We will time stamp and track participants' online activities to understand the study context and conduct exit interviews on acceptability of the staff and system-generated support. We will analyze data using mixed-effects regression models (short-term, long-term) to account for repeated measurements over time and utilize machine learning to construct and evaluate models predictive of outcomes. Specific aims are: Aim 1: To determine the short-term effects of YCWS. Hypothesis: in the first 8 weeks, compared to the control group, the experimental group will report reductions in pain intensity (primary outcome, 0-10 scale) and secondary outcomes--stress intensity (0-10 scale) and opioid use (oral morphine equivalence [OME]). Aim 2: To determine the long-term effects of YCWS. Hypothesis: in months 3-6, compared to control group, the experimental group will report reductions in pain intensity (primary outcome, 0-10 scale) and secondary outcomes--stress intensity (0-10 scale) and opioid use (oral morphine equivalence [OME]). Aim 3 (exploratory): Using machine learning, to develop and evaluate models that predict patient outcomes based on their group assignment and on their personal (e.g., self-efficacy, sex, education, family income, computer experience, etc.,) and environmental characteristics (e.g., distance from care, quality of cell connection, etc.). Findings will guide future studies on the implementation of the m-Health enabled YCWS self-management intervention in the real world by adults with SCD. Findings also will guide the discovery of an ideal delivery method for YCWS, and personal and environmental characteristics of patients who would benefit from YCWS to control effectively the pain of SCD and other types of pain and its psychological impact. Project Narrative Our long-term goal is to reduce stress and improve pain control with less opioid use in patients with sickle cell disease by promoting an intervention with self-management relaxation/distraction exercises, named You Cope, We Support (YCWS). Building on the successes of our prior formative studies to develop the intervention and study protocol, we now propose a well-designed, appropriately powered study to test effects of YCWS on stress, pain, and opioid use in adults with sickle cell disease.

"Automated Physiological Assessment of Chronic Pain in Daily Life The United States is in the midst of dual epidemics of chronic pain and opioid abuse, with approx. 20% of the population in persistent pain, and over 40,000 lives lost each year to opioid misuse. Chronic back pain (CBP) is the most common pain disorder and one of the major reasons for prescribing opioids. Strategies to help reduce CBP pain without opioids are therefore urgent. A promising opioid alternative are psychological interventions that reduce pain intensity, interference and negative emotions, and do not just target the physical pain intensity as many of the traditional pharmacological approaches do. However, these interventions are not often temporally aligned with pain episodes.  We propose to establish diagnostic physiological markers of ongoing clinical pain by capturing ongoing clinical pain and the associated physiological fluctuations and psychological processes. We will develop fully automated real-time detection of ongoing pain in N=80 CBP patients from physiological signs collected in everyday life. We will record multiple physiological signals (electroencephalogram (EEG), facial electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and heart rate (HR)) from two wearable device, one worn around the ears (Earable) and one worn around the wrist (Empatica). The sensing system will be integrated with an experience sampling method (ESM) smartphone app to collect ratings of pain and psychological processes associated with pain episodes. Our goal in Aim 1 is to establish computational physiology-based models that can predict clinical pain in real-life. To achieve this, we will apply machine-learning techniques to physiological data preceding pain self-reports to build predictive models of ongoing pain, with the ultimate goal for these computational models to be able to trigger psychological interventions when needed most, which we aim to develop in our future research. Our goal in Aim 2 is to field-test these computational models in a new group of N=20 CBP patients.  The proposed work will afford, for the first time, autonomous monitoring of clinical pain in real-life. If the real-life pain experience of patients can be captured in physiological patterns preceding pain, then automated tracking of physiology has considerable potential to improve the efficacy of psychological treatments, by providing signals to trigger just-in-time interventions. Overall, the proposed project will contribute fundamental scientific knowledge about psycho-physiological signs of real-life pain and lay the groundwork for translational efforts to improve outcomes of pain self-management and reduce opioid use. The United States is in the midst of dual epidemics of chronic pain and opioid abuse and treatments to reduce pain without opioids are therefore crucial and urgent - psychological treatments have shown potential but also limited efficacy thus far. In this proposal, we will record multiple physiological and psychological signs of pain to develop computational models of real-life fluctuations in chronic pain levels. The findings of this proposal will translate into psychological interventions better matched to psycho-physiological signs of clinical pain and will deepen our understanding of the multidimensional nature of chronic pain.",Automated Physiological Assessment of Chronic Pain in Daily Life,10219003,R21NR018972,"['Adult', 'American', 'Behavioral', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Ear', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electromyography', 'Electrooculogram', 'Electrooculography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Face', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Opioid', 'Pain', 'Pain Disorder', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persistent pain', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychophysiology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'chronic back pain', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'clinical pain', 'clinical predictors', 'experience', 'field study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'open source', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'pain patient', 'pain reduction', 'pain self-management', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'psychologic', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'sociodemographics', 'wearable device']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R21,2021,230311
"Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments? Project Summary / Abstract Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), characterized by persistent pain in the cheek and jaw area of the face, affect approximately 1 in 10 women at some point in their lives. TMD treatments primarily focus on peripheral factors; however, many patients with TMD show no signs of peripheral damage. It is now known that many chronic pain conditions, including TMD, involve pain centralization, meaning the pain is generated and maintained by central, rather than peripheral, nervous system processes. There are currently no well accepted means through which centralized TMD pain can be identified in the clinic, and the failure to properly identify these centralized cases means that ineffective peripheral treatments are administered. The specific aims of this project are to 1) Demonstrate that structural, functional, and neurochemical abnormalities exist in TMD that are similar to those reported in other centralized pain conditions, 2) Utilize questionnaire and quantitative sensory testing measures that can accurately detect centralized pain to place patients on a continuum from peripheral to centralized, and show that the brains of centralized, but not peripheral, patients differ significantly from healthy controls, and 3) Determine the measures of centralization and brain morphology, function, and chemistry that predict lack of improvement from a peripherally targeted treatment regimen, to show that centralized TMD patients do not respond as well to treatments that fail to target their pathology. The primary goal of the mentored (K99) portion of the award is to give the candidate the additional training in neuroimaging necessary for him to obtain a tenure track faculty position and successfully run his own independent research program. The K99 phase will take place at the University of Michigan, under the mentorship of Drs. Daniel Clauw, Richard Harris, and David Williams, who are world-renowned experts in centralized pain conditions, pain neuroimaging, and pain psychometrics, respectively. Dr. William Maixner (Duke University), a world- leading expert on TMD, will also serve as a mentor; he will advise the candidate on the clinically relevant aspects of TMD and help the candidate network with other more established TMD researchers. The University of Michigan is ideal for the K99 phase of the project because of the available resources, including faculty who are committed to clinical pain research and mentoring, research-devoted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and state-of-the-art pain testing equipment, and ample laboratory and office space at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. Upon completing the K99 portion of the award, the candidate will be well suited to make the transition to tenure-track faculty. Project Narrative TMD, which is the most prevalent orofacial pain condition, is a public health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life and function of numerous individuals. This project addresses large gaps in our knowledge of pain centralization in TMD, building off of what is currently known from other pain conditions. Improvement in our understanding of the etiology of TMD and how it influences treatment will be crucial to bring individualized medicine to TMD patients. As a first step, we will determine what central factors make the prevailing peripheral treatments less effective. The results of this project will inform future studies of TMD by pinpointing the most promising variables to measure in longitudinal treatment studies of TMD.",Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments?,10213007,R00DE026810,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Cheek structure', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insula of Reil', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Michigan', 'Motor Cortex', 'Naproxen', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nociception', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Orofacial Pain', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Persistent pain', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Prognosis', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Soft Diet', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'TMD treatment', 'Techniques', 'Temporomandibular Joint Disorders', 'Temporomandibular joint disorder pain', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain morphology', 'central pain', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'chronic pelvic pain', 'clinical pain', 'clinically relevant', 'dietary restriction', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'pain processing', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'tenure track']",NIDCR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R00,2021,246204
"Identifying Optimal Pain Management for Elders ABSTRACT Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical as poor management can impair recovery and lead to adverse events, including prolonged opioid use and transition to chronic pain. Additional specific risks in elder surgical patients include delirium and falls. Currently prejudice rather than evidence guides the complex problem of elder perioperative pain management. Given the gravity of the US opioid epidemic, policy makers are quickly establishing rules and regulations for opioid prescribing. These policies are blanket regulations that neglect emerging evidence regarding the need for differential opioid prescriptions based on clinical and patient factors, particularly in elders. Currently, there lacks tools to identify elders at high risk for adverse pain outcomes. Such tools are needed to provide critical evidence on pain management to stakeholders and move the field away from pain treatment for the ‘average’ elder patient to pain treatment for an individual. In this grant, we propose an innovative approach to advance the systematic analysis of postoperative pain in elders. Our approach will develop scalable, open source risk stratification tools for adverse pain outcomes in elders. We will accomplish this work in three aims. First, we will develop clinical phenotypes to identify and extract key discriminating features necessary to assess postoperative pain using EHRs. Next, we will develop pain risk stratification models using machine learning, including deep learning, methods and tools based on phenotypes developed in Aim 1. Finally, we will validate our models externally at the VA and disseminate our work through open source libraries and public websites. This project will deliver validated risk-stratification tools derived from real world evidence to identify elder patients at high risk for adverse pain outcomes following surgery, which can potentially reduce prescribed opioids circulating in the community– a key to curbing the opioid epidemic. NARRATIVE Surgery is common in elders and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical, as poor management can impair recovery, lead to increased morbidity and decreased quality of life. The proposed research will develop evidence needed to identify elder patients at high risk for adverse postoperative pain outcomes. Models will be developed at a tertiary academic health center, validated at the Veterans Health Administration and disseminated to the community via a publicly available website and open source libraries.",Identifying Optimal Pain Management for Elders,10212182,R01HS027434,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,393732
"Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Pain and effective pain management are among the most critical health issues facing Americans. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reported that as many as one-third of all Americans experience persistent pain at an annual cost of as much as $635 billion in medical treatment and lost productivity. Prescription opioids are increasingly used to treat acute and chronic pain. To date, epidemiologic research defining opioid-related adverse drug event (ADE) risk factors has relied on broad, static categorizations of risk derived from diagnostic codes. Though important foundational work, these studies have three important limitations: (1) they focus on only the most catastrophic ADE (overdose) and thus miss the opportunity to identify less severe, prodromal ADEs (e.g. fatigue, dizziness, sleepiness, over-sedation) that may precede and predict overdose; (2) they do not reliably capture aberrant drug-related behaviors (ADRBs)—risky patterns of use that may affect overdose risk; and (3) they rely on clinician- coded diagnoses in structured data, which have notoriously weak sensitivity and specificity, and neglect rich opioid-related information from unstructured clinical narratives. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of electronic health records and new computational methdologies to explore associations among prodromal adverse events, ADRBs, and overdose. This approach is critical to the development of next-generation opioid overdose prevention tools. ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Death rates among middle-aged adults, the largest demographic group in the U.S., are on the rise for the first time in several decades, largely because of the increase in drug overdose, the majority of which are due to prescription opioids.

"Multivariate Machine Learning to Characterize Opioid-induced Alterations in the Brain in Chronic Pain PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prescription opioids are a potent class of drugs for treating pain. However, growing body of research has described iatrogenic consequences of long-term (> 90 days) opioid use in patients with chronic pain including hyperalgesia and impaired executive function. Dopamine is a critical modulator of executive function. While changes in pain and behavior have been noted, little is known about the brain’s morphology, neural and dopaminergic activity that change over time with long-term prescription opioid use. Consistent with the NIDA Strategic Plan objective 1.3, this K25 proposal seeks to “establish the effects of drug use, addiction, and recovery on brain circuits, behavior, and health” using neuroimaging-informed tools. Specifically, the present study combines multiple levels of investigation, including structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) and neuropsychological assessments of executive function, and employ machine learning techniques for analysis to identify the effects of long-term prescription opioid use on the brain in chronic pain patients. The applicant will use her advanced quantitative skills in neuroimaging data analysis and modeling to training in QST, and experience in cognitive neuropsychology, epidemiology of chronic pain and addiction to develop an independent research plan in translational pain and successfully compete for future R01 funding. To achieve the training needed to facilitate this investigation, the applicant has consulted with an expert in chronic pain research and opioid therapy, a substance abuse specialist, a neuropsychologist, an epidemiologist, an imaging scientist, and a machine learning leader in neuroimaging field to develop an innovative study and training plan. 40 patients with a diagnostically homogeneous chronic pain condition (i.e., chronic low back pain; CLBP) on long-term opioid therapy, as compared to 40 opioid-naïve CLBP patients, will be studied to achieve the following Aims: 1) Measure pain, cognitive performance, neural and dopaminergic activity during concurrent pain and executive function task fMRI-PET to characterize the effects of opioids on pain processing and executive function in CLBP; 2) measure intrinsic brain activity during resting state fMRI-PET to identify intrinsic brain alterations associated with long-term opioid use in CLBP; and 3) apply high-resolution structural MRI to measure opioid-induced morphological changes in CLBP. This research is innovative in its use of combined QST and neuro- psychological measures with multimodal imaging and sophisticated statistical approaches. It is significant because of its comprehensive approach towards addressing the NIDA Strategic Plan objective. Findings stand to inform medical decision-making regarding pain care and opioid prescription, as well as risk mitigation strategies. The research, training and results obtained will provide a platform for applicant’s long-term scientific research goal of becoming an independent R01-funded, faculty-level principal investigator performing translational pain research aimed at developing neuroimaging tools to have clinical application. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE Inquiry into the effects of long-term prescription opioid use in patients with chronic pain are highly relevant and timely due to the increased epidemic of prescription opioid use in the US. Using quantitative sensory testing, neuropsychological assessments, multimodal neuroimaging and advanced statistical techniques for data analysis, the proposed study seeks to identify the effects of long-term prescription opioid use on the brain and their relation to clinical symptoms. By detecting changes at behavioral, molecular and neural systems levels, this study will be pivotal in the development of effective pain management strategies in chronic pain, and training of Dr. Jarrahi as an independent investigator in the field of translational pain research.",Multivariate Machine Learning to Characterize Opioid-induced Alterations in the Brain in Chronic Pain,10203904,K25DA048179,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Consult', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dopamine', 'Dopamine D1 Receptor', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intercept', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychophysics', 'Questionnaires', 'Raclopride', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'brain morphology', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain patient', 'chronic painful condition', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'dopamine system', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'imaging scientist', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'opioid tapering', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'pain behavior', 'pain patient', 'pain processing', 'patient oriented', 'prescription opioid', 'receptor binding', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'substance use', 'tool']",NIDA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K25,2021,175889
"Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO) PROJECT SUMMARY Analgesics are among the most commonly prescribed medications, and opioid painkillers are the gold standard for the management of severe acute pain, and for many chronic pain conditions. More than 30% of the U.S. population suffers from chronic pain, and nearly 40% of older adults report debilitating chronic pain conditions not caused by cancer. However, side effects of opioids, including tolerance, physical dependence, and respiratory depression have limited their effectiveness as pain killers. Rates of addiction and opioid overdose have escalated to a point of crisis. In the United States, on average approximately 115 people die every day from accidental overdose. Better, efficacious and safe opioid analgesic drugs with reduced risk of use are urgently needed. We propose to develop the Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO) – an integrated knowledgebase aimed at accelerating and improving the success of translational research and drug discovery programs towards the identification of efficacious and save opioid drugs. ODO will enable multi-tiered analyses across diverse data types and hypothesis development for example by connecting chemical structure, biochemical binding profiles, pharmacological responses in animals and drug side effects and thus enable more effective rational drug discovery programs. To develop ODO we will leverage our extensive previous work in several research consortia developing formal ontologies, data standards, processing and integration methods, and software systems to enable integrated access, query and analysis of large scale and diverse data types. The current proposal aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the ODO integrated knowledgebase and illustrate proof of concept via two Specific Aims: (1) to curate and harmonize ODO content from diverse data sources via a semantic knowledge model enabling integration of diverse data types, and (2) to deploy the ODO integrated Data Portal and Search Engine engaging the community and demonstrate its heuristic value. We envision that the ODO will pave the way to enable advanced machine learning and link results from molecular simulations with opioid analgesic drug pharmacology and functional selectivity, thus facilitating, at larger scale, the rational, predictive design, and scaffold optimization in drug development efforts towards identifying safer opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pain is the number one reason people seek medical attention. Although narcotic pain killers are effective, they are highly addictive and have severe side effects. Doctors need better opioid drugs to treat moderate to severe pain. We propose to develop the Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO), the first public opioid drug knowledgebase with the capability to use machine learning tools to help scientists design new drugs to treat pain without harmful side effects.",Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO),10228543,R21DA048313,"['Acute Pain', 'Analgesics', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Data Store', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Side Effects', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'FAIR principles', 'Failure', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Narcotics', 'Network-based', 'Neuropharmacology', 'Ontology', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Opioid Receptor Binding', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Dependence', 'Population', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Publications', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'clinical pain', 'cloud based', 'computer framework', 'computerized data processing', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data harmonization', 'data portal', 'data standards', 'design', 'diverse data', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'journal article', 'knowledge base', 'medical attention', 'metadata standards', 'mu opioid receptors', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'search engine', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,191875

"Opioid Support and Risk Reduction Online Platform Project Summary  This proposal seeks to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of developing an online support and risk reduction platform to prevent opioid misuse and abuse. This is an urgent area of research; opioid misuse/abuse has reached epidemic proportions in recent years. It is linked to causing the largest drug epidemic in the history of the United States and has become the top priority of the US Surgeon General. Because the opioid crisis (including heroin use) is believed to have largely originated from chronic pain patients' opioid prescriptions, this application will initially focus on the needs of chronic pain patients on opioids who are high risk for addiction and overdose. Later versions of the technology will expand to the broader population of people affected by the opioid crisis, including heroin users.  Although low cost, novel interventions are needed to reduce opioid misuse and abuse, before they lead to addiction and fatal overdose, only 6 behavioral (non-pharmacological) randomized controlled trials have been successfully conducted in this area to date (with our group having conducted one of them), creating a tremendous need for solutions to the opioid crisis. Building off extensive preliminary research that our team conducted, including piloting technology-based behavior change interventions among chronic pain patients, and developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction models of opioid outcomes, we propose to design and test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an online peer social support and clinical counseling community to reduce opioid misuse/abuse among chronic pain sufferers.  This is a highly innovative product with scalable commercialization potential and impact as 1) no software platform exists that has been shown to reduce opioid misuse/abuse risk factors, 2) it is evidenced- based, supported by more than a decade of scientific research conducted by our team, and 3) is highly accessible, helping to address the time, cost, and stigma that are constant barriers to opioid prevention and treatment.  Our team includes the former CFO of Epic Systems (and two-time successful entrepreneur), the Associate Chief Medical Information Officer for Cedars-Sinai, a patent attorney at a large Silicon Valley intellectual property firm specializing in digital health portfolios, as well as clinical, data science/statistical, and research experts who conducted more than a decade of formative research leading up to this application.

"Technologies for OUD Prevention, Control and Supportive Care - Development of Patient/Caregiver mobile application and Provider Dashboard ABSTRACT Pain is an important issue for both society and health care. The increasing frequency of individuals with chronic pain as the result of chronic diseases and postoperative pain have directly led, over the past two decades, to the over-prescription and misuse of opioids. In early 2019, an estimated 130 people per day were dying from opioid- related drug overdoses, 2 million people were misusing first-time opioid prescriptions, and almost 33000 deaths were attributed to overdosing with synthetic non-methadone opioids in the USA alone. Even though respiratory depression and complete respiratory arrest are the major causes of mortality with opioid overdose, there is currently a serious knowledge gap in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of opioid pain relief and respiratory depression by opioids, and how these mechanisms differ from each other. Aidar Health’s ground- breaking technology offers a rapid medical assessment device, MouthLab, which non-invasively measures 10+ vital medical parameters in under 60 seconds, and an enterprise platform that leverages data science, to create a new kind of precision medicine through clinical-grade monitoring, at home. A point-of-care solution such as MouthLab is fundamental in understanding the impact of prescribed opioids and synthetic drugs, its impact on the underlying chronic condition and effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Powered by AI and machine learning, Aidar’s proprietary software would be able to provide deeper, real-time insights of subtle changes in physiology to assist the provider with decisions related to drug titration, treatment changes, adjunct therapies before any adverse event can occur. MouthLab’s ability to combine a wide-ranging spectrum of cardiopulmonary measurements (i.e. SpO2, Heart rate, Heart rate variability, Respiratory Rate, Respiratory Flow Cycle Morphology, Spirometry), would be able to solve the problem of lack of real-time health insights which would have significant relevance to providers in the treatment development process through the collection of multiple biomarker data linked to opioid-induced respiratory depression. This product creates a fundamental shift in the technology employed at home by identifying early warning symptoms through a multiparameter approach and facilitates understanding of the underlying mechanisms linking pain relief with control of breathing to identify pain therapies with minimal or no respiratory side effects. The novelty is affirmed with two approved patents and the freedom to operate analysis that found no prior art of concern. The goal of this project is to develop software infrastructure that would enhance the progressive and holistic monitoring of users experiencing OUD. By the end of this award, the company will test and validate the newly developed software capabilities in a small cohort of patients and controls at TentHouse Health & Wellness. Our solution has a validated business model (through over 100 consumers at Johns Hopkins Hospital and with 6 Pharmaceutical customer interviews) that drive value for patients, physicians, biopharmaceuticals, and payers. A successful development of this product is forecast to create 43 new jobs (2022) with an annual payroll exceeding $11.5M. As a direct result of this award, this innovative product can reach the U.S. market in 2022, with $123M in projected revenue by 2025. Our mission is to empower the uses and improve the quality of life of every individual with OUD. MouthLab will essentially be like a ‘Check Engine’ light for individual with OUD. NARRATIVE Pain is an important issue for both society and healthcare. In the USA, the annual burden on society has been estimated at $560-$635 billion. The increasing frequency of individuals with chronic pain as the result of chronic diseases and postoperative pain have directly led, over the past two decades, to the over prescription and misuse of opioids. Using Aidar’s rapid health assessment device, MouthLab, we aim to measure 10+ vital health parameters and by developing unique software capabilities we offer providers and caregivers the access to user- level data and key health insights, in real-time, for early detection of health deterioration and timely intervention at home. By removing the barriers to clinical care and research, we are in parallel capturing the largest digital dataset on human health and disease, which will transform our understanding of health, behavior, and OUD-related mitigation strategies.","Technologies for OUD Prevention, Control and Supportive Care - Development of Patient/Caregiver mobile application and Provider Dashboard",10259108,R43DA053870,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'American', 'Analgesics', 'Arts', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Breathing', 'Businesses', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Exercise', 'Expectancy', 'Fentanyl', 'Fostering', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heroin', 'Home', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal trends', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morphology', 'Non-Malignant', 'Nurses', 'Occupations', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Spirometry', 'Street Drugs', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Unemployment', 'Uninsured', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'biophysical properties', 'chronic pain', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'craving', 'dashboard', 'data access', 'digital', 'electronic consent', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'informal caregiver', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loved ones', 'mental state', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'nutrition', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'outreach program', 'overdose death', 'pain relief', 'phrases', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'prescription opioid', 'pressure', 'product development', 'remote monitoring', 'respiratory', 'response', 'side effect', 'social determinants', 'software development', 'software infrastructure', 'synthetic drug', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'trend', 'virtual']",NIDA,"MULTISENSOR DIAGNOSTICS, LLC",R43,2021,221150
"A Digital Therapeutic for Pain Relief through AI-Guided Visual Stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY Dandelion™ was founded in 2020 to develop digital therapeutics for neurologic and psychiatric disorders by interacting with the brain via the eyes. The goal of this SBIR is to design and test a safe, effective, and non- addictive pain-relief digital therapeutic in the form of visual stimuli. The platform will use artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time biofeedback to “read” (decipher) brain signals and “write” to (neuromodulate) the brain with rapid-changing visual stimuli composed of optimized patterns, colors, and frequencies. This is the first attempt to use AI-guided visual stimuli as a treatment for pain. In 2017, 11 million of the 191 million prescriptions written for opioid pain medications were misused, and 35% of opioid-related deaths (nearly 17,000 cases) were connected to these prescriptions. In the search for safe, effective alternatives, a range of opioid-sparing interventions have been developed through pharmacologic, clinical, and digitized behavioral platforms but none has proved fully successful. Dandelion hypothesizes that the complexity and variability of pain demands a therapeutic approach that mimics the way the brain itself processes and integrates data for pain perception. Through its novel neuromodulatory platform, using artificial intelligence to parameterize potentially useful visual information, Dandelion will develop a safe, low-cost digital therapeutic that patients can view on a smartphone or tablet for immediate pain relief. By correlating stimulus with response across different types of pain, Dandelion also hopes to build a pain-perception map of wider applicability. In Phase I a prototype AI-guided platform will be developed that can synthesize novel stimulation combinations and optimize them based on feedback from an array of biosensors; their efficacy in reducing the perception of induced pain will then be tested in healthy subjects. In Phase II, Dandelion will develop the prototype into a commercially available product and test the pain-relief digital therapeutic for efficacy and generalizability in randomized controlled trials. The commercial opportunity is estimated to be $5.9 billion. PROJECT NARRATIVE Dandelion is developing a non-addictive pain treatment that patients can view on their smartphone or tablet for immediate relief.

"The Neural Underpinnings of Depression and Cannabis Use in Young PLWH PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In response to RFA-DA-21-012, “Elucidation of mechanisms underlying complex morbidities of SUD and other mental Illnesses in people living with HIV/AIDS” (PLWH), we propose to investigate reward and pain circuitry in cannabis use and depression comorbidity, two highly prevalent conditions in PLWH. We will focus on young adults (ages 18-34) to minimize HIV neuronal chronicity effects and in light of the high rates of substance use and reduced adherence to HIV treatment in this age group. Our proposed model is: 1) Both reward dysfunction (deficits in reward learning, expectancy, attainment, positive prediction errors) and pain hypersensitivity (pain sensitivity, aversion, negative prediction errors) contribute to cannabis use and depression comorbidity in young PLWH. 2) The habenula (Hb), a small limbic hub, plays a pivotal regulatory role in these processes by inhibiting ventral tegmental area (VTA) reward signals to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) following pain and loss. 3) THC, a major component of cannabis, exerts its psychoactive analgesic effects by binding to cannabinoid 1 receptors in the reward and pain systems, including the anterior cingulate (ACC), periaqueductal gray (PAG), thalamus, amygdala, VTA, NAc, and Hb, creating temporary relief of mood and pain symptoms but resulting in long-term alterations in reward circuitry that exacerbate depression and substance use. 4) Capitalizing on improvements in fMRI resolution, our novel imaging methods overcome prior technical constraints to study the Hb and other small structures critical to reward and pain processing. Supporting data from PLWH ages 18-34 in our health system show that 43% have depression, 21% have cannabis use disorders, and only 68% had undetectable HIV viral load (VL). Using the reward flanker (RFT) and reward prediction error (RPET) fMRI tasks, we documented distinct brain activity during reward anticipation, attainment and prediction error, which predicted future depression severity. Further, we detected Hb activation during RPET and a pain task, and mapped Hb intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) with regions critical to reward (VTA), pain (insula, PAG), or both circuits (NAc, ACC). Distinct Hb iFC were documented in relation to depression, anhedonia and cannabis use. We hypothesize that cannabis use and depression in young PLWH have an additive effect, inducing both reward deficits and pain hypersensitivity and that this pattern will predict worse outcomes at 1 year follow-up. We will utilize a 2×2 factorial design: 1) 70 depressed cannabis users; 2) 70 depressed cannabis non-users; 3) 70 non-depressed cannabis users; and 4) 70 non-depressed cannabis non-users. Participants will have comprehensive evaluations at baseline, 6- and 12-months including depression, substance, reward, pain, anxiety, trauma, HIV treatment, CD4+ count, and VL. Baseline cognitive testing and fMRI (resting-state, RFT, RPET, pain) will be performed. Analytical approaches will include machine learning classifications.  PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to investigate reward and pain circuitry in cannabis use and depression comorbidity in young people (ages 18-34) living with HIV (PLWH) in the Bronx, New York in light of the high rates of substance use, reduced adherence to HIV treatment, and suboptimal viral suppression in this population. This collaborative proposal bridges disciplines of depression, neuroimaging, HIV, and addiction in an effort to improve our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying co-occurring cannabis use and depression in young PLWH and has the potential to improve HIV, substance use, and mental health outcomes. This research is expected to facilitate the identification of specific biomarkers to serve as key diagnostic features and may result in new treatment strategies suggested by improved understanding of mechanisms of disease.",The Neural Underpinnings of Depression and Cannabis Use in Young PLWH,10331210,R01DA054885,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Analgesics', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Binding', 'Blood Tests', 'Brain', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'CNR1 gene', 'Cannabis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Expectancy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Habenula', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurons', 'New York', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Sex Orientation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tetrahydrocannabinol', 'Thalamic structure', 'Trauma', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Work', 'addiction', 'age group', 'behavioral construct', 'causal model', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'graph theory', 'health disparity', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana use disorder', 'marijuana user', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'pain processing', 'pain scale', 'pain sensitivity', 'pain symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'reward circuitry', 'reward processing', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance use', 'subthreshold depression', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDA,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,818232
"Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia ABSTRACT Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a debilitating, chronic pain condition affecting adolescents, primarily females, during a critical period for brain development, and that persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Due to the lack of definite physical or laboratory findings, JFM has been questioned as a clinical entity, and sometimes regarded as merely an expression of anxiety or depression. This leads to poor understanding, stigmatization, and appropriate disease management, underscoring the need for identifying objective pathophysiology. We have previously used machine learning applied to fMRI data to yield multivariate patterns of distributed brain activity that, together, can identify test subjects as adult FM patients vs. healthy adults with high cross-validated accuracy (93%). However, extrapolating adult FM brain abnormalities to JFM is problematic, given the many factors impacting the developing adolescent brain and the clinical differences between adult and juvenile forms of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to identify brain pathophysiology characteristic of JFM during tailored symptom provocation tasks. There is currently a complete lack of research into the brain correlates of pain in children with widespread pain/JFM. This study will lay the foundation for a line of research in understanding the neurophysiologic underpinnings of JFM, discovering whether brain pathophysiology in JFM differs from adult FM, and assessing treatment effects on specific markers of brain pathophysiology. This study is an R01 ancillary study to the NIH/NIAMS-funded trial (R01 AR070474; Kashikar-Zuck), “Multi-site randomized clinical trial of Fibromyalgia Integrative Training for Juvenile Fibromyalgia (FIT Teens)”. The exceptionally well characterized cohort of JFM patients from the parent trial presents a unique opportunity to study JFM neural correlates. Our time-sensitive study will transform the scientific output of the parent project by identifying neurophysiological correlates of pain, psychological and physical symptoms in this large, representative, extensively-characterized sample of JFM patients before and after treatment. We hypothesize that machine learning applied to fMRI data during tailored symptom-provocation tasks will identify patterns of neural activity predictive of JFM status (vs. healthy), which will correlate with JFM symptom dimensions (pain, non-painful sensory hypersensitivity, fatigue, and depressive symptoms). This ancillary study will utilize the comprehensive psychological and physical functioning profiles already being captured in the parent R01 trial to identify clinically meaningful neurologic measures in JFM and explore the potential for these measures to change with treatment. This line of research has the potential for a profound impact on understanding and identifying JFM pathophysiology and providing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study will use functional brain imaging to identify patterns of brain activity associated with juvenile fibromyalgia and assess treatment effects on such neural patterns. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s Federal Pain Research Strategy because of its potential for a profound impact on understanding JFM neural pathophysiology and developing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations.",Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia,10242702,R01AR074795,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anxiety', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Judgment', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Neurologic', 'Ohio', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Painless', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persistent pain', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stigmatization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'chronic painful condition', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical pain', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'fibromyalgia patients', 'hands-on learning', 'innovation', 'multisensory', 'neural correlate', 'neural patterning', 'neuromuscular', 'neurophysiology', 'pain symptom', 'parent project', 'physical symptom', 'psychologic', 'psychological symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,391008
"Mechanical Biomarkers of Chronic Low Back Pain Abstract The intervertebral disc (IVD) has an essential role in transferring load during normal spine function and when this normal function fails, symptoms, degeneration and altered spine mechanics may occur. The overall scientific premise of this work is that there is a gap in knowledge of the relationship between contributions from mechanical, inflammatory and biopsychosocial factors that lead to chronic low back pain (LBP). An important gap is a poor understanding of the relationship between IVD degeneration and LBP. This lack of understanding leads to discordance between imaging and self-reported pain and, ultimately, treatments being delivered by an exclusionary process. To address this gap, we will use innovative in vivo imaging tools to quantify the mechanical function of the IVD. We will also measure quantitative sensory factors, biochemical markers, and biopsychosocial factors that, when combined with mechanical function, may better identify subgroups or phenotypes of LBP. The overall goal of this project is to identify if mechanical function of the IVD is a potential risk factor and whether mechanical function can assist with defining phenotypes of LBP. The findings from this study would lead to longitudinal analyses to determine whether these phenotypes predict the transition from acute to chronic LBP. The rationale for this proposed research is that: 1) altered mechanical function of the IVD contributes to LBP. 2) LBP is a heterogeneous condition that can result from a combination of mechanical, inflammatory, and central pain based sources. The central hypothesis is that in vivo measured IVD mechanical function will be an important potential risk factor for both acute and chronic non-specific LBP and that this measure will improve the phenotyping of LBP. In Aim I, we will quantify the association between in-vivo measured IVD mechanical function among acute and chronic non-specific LBP participants and asymptomatic controls. In Aim II, we will derive well-defined phenotypes of LBP using combinations of potential risk factors. Identifying phenotypes of LBP will allow for specific rehabilitation, surgical, pharmaceutical or behavioral treatments to be targeted, resulting in improved patient outcomes. Project Narrative Low back pain is a complex and costly public health problem. We will use innovative combinations of in vivo imaging to quantify mechanical function of the intervertebral disc and combine this information with other known risk factors to develop subgroups of patients with low back pain. This can lead to specific interventions to improve outcomes for patients with low back pain.",Mechanical Biomarkers of Chronic Low Back Pain,10171398,R01AR075399,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Back Pain', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intervertebral disc structure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Low Back Pain', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Neuropeptides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'biopsychosocial factor', 'central pain', 'chronic musculoskeletal pain', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost', 'demographics', 'experience', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'inflammatory pain', 'innovation', 'intervertebral disk degeneration', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'random forest', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIAMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,604326
"Improving representation of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic study participants in a trial of virtual reality for chronic lower back pain PROJECT SUMMARY Although digital health technologies are now widely available for both therapeutic and monitoring applications, there are racial and ethnic disparities in uptake and effectiveness of digital health interventions. Of relevance to our parent HEAL study examining a digital health intervention (virtual reality) for pain management, recent data indicate that non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients are less likely to have access to digital health information and more likely to report severe pain than non-Hispanic whites. In addition to disparities in access and adoption of digital health interventions, there are known disparities in the incidence and reporting of pain by racial and ethnic minorities. For example, study of 2000 patients found that non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients were more likely to report severe pain than non-Hispanic whites. The proposed study for this Diversity, Inclusion and Engagement Supplement to our NIH HEAL study evaluating the role of therapeutic VR for chronic lower back pain (cLBP) will provide a framework to advance diversity and inclusion efforts for future digital health trials at our medical center and beyond. Further, it will enhance the parent study by seeking to increase the proportion of participants with historically less access to and familiarity with digital technologies while enhancing overall participant racial and ethnic diversity. Using the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development supported by advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven cohort building tools, we propose to meaningfully improve enrollment rates of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants in our parent NIH HEAL study by achieving two aims: (1) tailor recruitment materials for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients with cLBP in partnership with representative patient advisory boards; and (2) oversample non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants in parent study using an AI-driven cohort building tool housed within the electronic health record. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although digital health technologies are now widely available for both therapeutic and monitoring applications, there are disparities in patient knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and preferences regarding uptake and effectiveness of digital health interventions.

"Wearable nanocomposite sensor system for diagnosing mechanical sources of low back pain and guiding rehabilitation PROJECT SUMMARY Back pain has gained the distinction of being the most disabling condition in the world [1-3], affecting 80-90% of the US population at some point in their lifetime, with 29% of the US population having experienced lower back pain within the last 3 months. Back and neck pain are the leading cause of missed work days and rank second only to the common cold as a reason for a visit to the doctor, accounting for approximately 30% of general practitioner visits. Of particular concern is chronic low back pain (cLBP), which is recurrent and often non-responsive to conservative treatments. It has long been recognized that spinal pathology changes the way that we move. Biomechanists, physical therapists, and surgeons each utilize a variety of tools and techniques to assess and interpret qualitative movement changes as a window to understanding potential mechanical and neurological sources of low back pain and as a critical element in their treatment paradigm. However, objectively characterizing and communicating this information is currently impossible, since clinically feasible (e.g., cost-effective, objective, and accurate) tools and quantitative benchmarks do not exist. This proposal addresses the challenge to improve cLBP outcomes through the use of unique, inexpensive, screen-printable, elastomer-based nano-composite piezoresponsive sensors which will be integrated into a SPInal Nanosensor Environment (SPINE Sense System) to measure lumbar kinematics and provide an objective, quantitative platform for diagnosis, monitoring, and follow-up assessment of cLBP.

"Technology Research Site for Advanced, Faster Quantitative Imaging for BACPAC PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disorders of the spine have a tremendous impact on society; both physically through the morbidity of afflicted individuals, and financially, through lost productivity and increased health care costs. Despite the significance of this problem, the etiology of symptoms is diverse and unclear in many patients, and there are few reliable methods by which to prospectively determine the appropriate course of patient care and to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions. Challenges contributing to this major healthcare dilemma include numerous sources of back pain, difficulty in visualization of responsible tissues using any single imaging technique and difficulty in the localization of pain and contributing molecular processes.

"Technology Research Site for Advanced, Faster Quantitative Imaging for BACPAC PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disorders of the spine have a tremendous impact on society; both physically through the morbidity of afflicted individuals, and financially, through lost productivity and increased health care costs. Despite the significance of this problem, the etiology of symptoms is diverse and unclear in many patients, and there are few reliable methods by which to prospectively determine the appropriate course of patient care and to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions. Challenges contributing to this major healthcare dilemma include numerous sources of back pain, difficulty in visualization of responsible tissues using any single imaging technique and difficulty in the localization of pain and contributing molecular processes. Magnetic Resonance imaging (MR) has been used to characterize disc, muscle, nerves and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been used to study bone turnover, and facet disease in subjects with lower back pain.  The research and tool development proposed in this UH2/UH3 takes the critical next step in the clinical translation of faster, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MR) of patients with lower back pain.

"Novel PET/MR Imaging Approach for Persistent Postsurgical Pain Following Joint Replacement Project Abstract Overview: This project aims to develop a reliable 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/MRI method with novel metal artifact correction techniques to provide early identification of prosthetic complications causing persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Relevance: THA is one of the most rapidly growing procedures to treat the end-stage hip joint pain and dysfunction, and its annual cases are estimated to reach 572,000 by 2030. Unfortunately, a substantial number of patients experience PPSP after the procedure, which, without proper treatment, can significantly impair the quality of life. However, the early identification of pain generators for these patients is very difficult because the current diagnostic methods including X-ray, CT, and MRI, have limited sensitivity to pain and suffer from severe artifacts induced by metal in prostheses. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a novel diagnostic approach to accurately identify the abnormal inflammatory changes causing persistent pain to guide the appropriate treatment matched to the exact sources of pain. Approach: We propose the use of 18F-FDG PET/MRI for early identification of sources of PPSP following THA. Our previous 18F-FDG PET/MRI study of chronic pain syndromes demonstrated promising improvements in detecting sites of painful inflammation. However, the severe metal artifacts near metallic prostheses limit the application of 18F-FDG PET/MRI to THA patients. Therefore, our first aim in this project is the development of metal-aware attenuation correction for PET to enable reliable 18F-FDG PET near the metallic prosthesis. Our second aim is the development of high-resolution hip MRI at 3T with metal artifact correction to improve our ability for identifying structural causes of PPSP symptoms. Our third aim is to validate the improvements by 18F- FDG PET/MRI in detection of the pain generators compared to PET/CT and conventional MRI. This will be accomplished by correlating the pain score measurements with 18F-FDG PET/MRI abnormalities at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months following the unilateral THA procedure. Summary: We propose to develop a novel 18F-FDG PET/MRI approach with metal artifact correction methods for early detection of periprosthetic complications causing PPSP following THA. Successful implementation of our method will enable early indication of individualized, effective treatments for THA patients with PPSP. Project Narrative More than a million cases of total joint arthroplasty are performed in the U.S. each year, but 7% to 34% of the patients are estimated to have persistent postsurgical pain after the procedure. Unfortunately, the identification of periprosthetic pain generators using current diagnostic imaging methods is very difficult due to the limited sensitivity and severe artifacts near metallic prostheses. Focusing on total hip arthroplasty cases, we will develop a reliable 18F-FDG PET/MRI method with metal-artifact-correction that allows highly-sensitive metabolic exam and high-resolution morphologic exam for early detection of painful complications following joint arthroplasty.",Novel PET/MR Imaging Approach for Persistent Postsurgical Pain Following Joint Replacement,10211307,R01AR077706,"['Address', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Arthralgia', 'Awareness', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heating', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip Prosthesis', 'Hip region structure', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Orthopedic Surgery', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Persistent pain', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Water', 'attenuation', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pain score', 'pain sensitivity', 'pain symptom', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'tool', 'uptake', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,420193
"Characterization of Chronic Pain and its Biopsychosocial Mechanisms in Lupus using Electronic Health Records Up to 100 million Americans live with ongoing pain, costing $635 billion annually. In the United States, there are more than 200,000 people living with SLE, a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease with multi-organ involvement that disproportionately affects females and racial minorities. Living with a chronic disease such as SLE confers multiple challenges. Pain is a frequent self-reported symptom in SLE and is often one of the first symptoms of the disease. Despite treatment advances, pain remains the most prominent, unaddressed patient complaint. The management of pain in SLE has recently become more challenging because of the alarming epidemic of addiction and mortality attributed to opioid misuse. An estimated 31-46% of patients with SLE use prescription opioids. In one study, 70% of individuals using opioids used them for ≥1 year, and 22% were taking ≥2 opioid medications at the same time. Patients with SLE are nearly twice as likely as the general population to have opioid-related overdose hospitalizations. However, efforts to mitigate opioid misuse cannot be achieved without a detailed understanding and sustained investment in clinical research on the underlying mechanisms that produce and maintain chronic pain. Characterizing the burden of chronic pain in SLE is challenging on at least two counts. First, we lack data on the prevalence and burden of chronic pain in SLE, partly due to the absence of reliable approaches to identify patients with clinically significant pain in electronic health records (EHR). Second, there is a critical need to understand the biopsychosocial mechanisms and correlates that drive the pain experience in SLE. In this mentored career development award (K01), Dr. Titilola Falasinnu will use computational methods to increase the understanding of the clinical management chronic pain in SLE using EHR. In Aim 1, Dr. Falasinnu will develop a computational chronic pain phenotyping algorithm using diagnostic codes, pain scores, narrative clinic notes and medications extracted from the EHRs of two large healthcare systems (n~2,400). She will then use the algorithm to estimate chronic pain prevalence in a population-based registry (n~76,000). In Aim 2, Dr. Falasinnu will comprehensively phenotype biopsychosocial correlates of chronic pain using an existing registry of ~500 patients with SLE attending a multi-disciplinary pain center. Throughout the award, Dr. Falasinnu will build on her doctoral training as an epidemiologist and biostatistician to develop new skills in biomedical informatics to conduct impactful pain medicine research. These skills will include working with EHR and registry data, machine learning and natural language processing, pain science, grant-writing, and scientific communication. Through coursework, clinical observation in pain medicine clinics, mentorship, and external conferences and workshops, Dr. Falasinnu will gain the skills needed to apply for her first R01 and pursue a career as a tenure-track principal investigator. Despite treatment advances in rheumatology, pain remains the most prominent, unaddressed patient complaint in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a condition that disproportionately affects women and racial minorities. The proposed research uses electronic health records to characterize chronic pain and its biopsychosocial mechanisms in SLE. The information learned from the study is relevant to public health efforts to understand the burden and natural history of pain; and it is also relevant to NIAM’s mission of improving the understanding of biopsychosocial components of pain in rheumatology.",Characterization of Chronic Pain and its Biopsychosocial Mechanisms in Lupus using Electronic Health Records,10192176,K01AR079039,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Analgesics', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Female', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Resources Management', 'Investments', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Clinics', 'Pain Research', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persistent pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population-Based Registry', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'biomedical informatics', 'biopsychosocial', 'body map', 'career', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain management', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data registry', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'pain catastrophizing', 'pain reduction', 'pain score', 'patient stratification', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'post-doctoral training', 'prescription opioid', 'profiles in patients', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial minority', 'skills', 'social', 'sociodemographic variables', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment', 'tenure track', 'text searching', 'unstructured data']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,126252
"The Role of Glial Cells in Chronic Pelvic Pain of Endometriosis Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Nowak, Romana A. Endometriosis is an inflammatory disease that affects 10% of women but is present in up to 70% of women with pelvic pain and 30% of women with infertility. The estimated cost of endometriosis is over $22 billion in the US alone, not counting associated chronic illnesses. Thus it is safe to say that endometriosis is one of the costliest reproductive diseases in women not only in terms of treatment but also lost productivity and quality of life in affected patients. The mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of persistent or chronic pain are not fully understood. One potential mechanism is the process of ‘central sensitization’, whereby long lasting molecular changes promote neuroplasticity of nociceptive neurons within the central nervous system (CNS) resulting in amplification of pain signaling. The development of central sensitization involves changes to neuronal and glial cell populations. Neural changes have been studied in endometriosis and it has been suggested that pain attributed to endometriosis is likely to involve neuronal processes leading to central sensitization. However, a potential role for glia has yet to be investigated. Our hypothesis is that mice with endometriosis will show significant changes in the activation state and function of glial cells in the brain and spinal cord in response to persistent pro-inflammatory signaling from activated macrophages in ectopic lesions and peritoneal fluid and that this activation contributes to the development of chronic visceral pain. The goal of this exploratory research proposal is to begin testing this hypothesis using an in vivo mouse model of endometriosis to determine whether the presence of endometriotic lesions and the subsequent activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages in the peritoneum and endometriotic lesions causes substantial alterations in the proliferation, activation status and gene expression in glial cells of the spinal cord and brain. We will test this hypothesis in two specific aims: 1): To characterize changes in activation and proliferation of glial cells in the brain and spinal cord of mice that develop endometriosis and correlate these changes with development of chronic visceral pain. This will be determined by comprehensive immunohistochemical analyses of brains and spinal cords of mice with lesions as well as a panel of behavior tests that assess pain. 2): To sequence and identify genome-wide transcriptional alterations in microglia of the brain and spinal cord of mice with endometriosis. We will utilize single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) technology to analyze changes in gene expression over time in purified populations of glial cells in spinal cords and brains of mice bearing endometriotic lesions and compare these changes with mice that have undergone sham transplantation surgery. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09) Page Continuation Format Page PROJECT NARRATIVE The long term goal of this project is to address critical gaps in our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that lead to the development of chronic pelvic pain in endometriosis. We will use a mouse model of endometriosis to investigate the inflammatory response of glial cells in the spinal cord and brain in response to inflammatory macrophages in the peritoneum and endometriotic lesions and how this activation leads to central sensitization and chronic visceral pain. .",The Role of Glial Cells in Chronic Pelvic Pain of Endometriosis,10251334,R21HD100725,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Bladder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Chromium', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endometrial', 'Female', 'Ganglia', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Gland', 'Glial Cell Proliferation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Interstitial Cystitis', 'Investigation', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Microglia', 'Migraine', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nerve Endings', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neuroimmune', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Nociception', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Ovary', 'Pain', 'Pain Attribute', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Pelvis', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nerves', 'Peritoneal', 'Peritoneal Fluid', 'Peritoneal Macrophages', 'Peritoneum', 'Persistent pain', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Quality of life', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcription Alteration', 'Transplantation Surgery', 'Visceral pain', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cell type', 'central pain', 'central sensitization', 'chemokine', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pelvic pain', 'cost', 'cost estimate', 'cytokine', 'endometriosis', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'glial activation', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'macrophage', 'mouse model', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'pain perception', 'pain signal', 'peripheral pain', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'reproductive', 'reproductive system disorder', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,190247
"Neuroimaging-Based Brain and Spinal Cord Biomarkers for Cervical Radiculopathy Chronic pain is a widespread problem that affects a third of Americans and greatly burdens the health care system. Despite its prevalence, chronic pain remains poorly understood, and the current clinical strategies are minimally effective. The application of advanced neuroimaging techniques to the study of chronic pain has significantly increased our understanding of the brain’s role in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, and through these studies, researchers have uncovered previously unknown neural processes involved in pain chronification. The spinal cord is the caudal extension of the brainstem and is actively involved in the modulation and transmission of neural signals between the body and the brain. Alterations in the neural processing in the spinal cord are also thought to have an integral role in pain chronification. Recent advancements in spinal cord neuroimaging have made the quantitative study of the spinal cord’s role in chronic pain possible. Expanding the neuroimaging-based investigation of chronic pain to the spinal cord will provide a complete perspective of the central processes underlying pain chronification. In this mentored career development award (K23), Dr. Weber will identify, characterize, and longitudinally track neuroimaging-based biomarkers for chronic pain in the brain and spinal cord using cervical radiculopathy as a model condition for chronic pain. Cervical radiculopathy is a common cause of neck and upper limb pain and provides a unique opportunity to scientifically study chronic pain in a homogenous patient sample. In Aims 1 and 2, Dr. Weber will identify differences in the brain and spinal cord networks between patients with chronic pain due to right-sided cervical radiculopathy and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In Aim 3, clinical measures in the same cohort of cervical radiculopathy patients will be longitudinally tracked at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the imaging session, and neuroimaging-based prognostic factors contributing to pain reduction in cervical radiculopathy will be identified. In the same cohort of patients, the imaging will be repeated at 12 months, and the links between the changes in the brain and spinal cord and recovery will be explored. This research will move the pain field forward by further elucidating the neural processes underlying chronic pain and its recovery. Throughout the award period, Dr. Weber will obtain new skills and expertise in conducting clinical studies including randomized controlled trials and applying advanced computational methods to clinical pain research. Additionally, Dr. Weber will gain further training in advanced neuroimaging methods, pain neurobiology, career development, and grant writing. To accomplish the proposed research and training, Dr. Weber has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of world-class mentors who are committed to his success. This training will build on Dr. Weber’s clinical background and doctoral research training in neuroscience and ultimately provide him with the knowledge and skillset to establish an independent research program, in which, he will lead impactful scientific research that intersects neuroimaging and clinical pain research. New advances in medical imaging are uncovering the central nervous system’s role in chronic pain. Here, we aim to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to identify and characterize neuroimaging-based biomarkers for chronic pain in the brain and spinal cord of cervical radiculopathy patients.

"UCSF Stanford Endometriosis Center for Discovery, Innovation, Training and Community Engagement ABSTRACT - OVERALL Endometriosis is a chronic, debilitating estrogen-dependent disease wherein tissue similar to the uterine lining (endometrium) is found mainly on pelvic tissues and organs where it causes an inflammatory response, scarring, pelvic pain, and infertility. It affects millions of reproductive age women and severely impacts quality of life and professional life, and has a huge health economic impact of about $69B annually in the U.S. While its etiology is uncertain, profound dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems is associated with inefficient lesion clearance and pelvic and systemic inflammation. The heterogeneity of endometriosis lesions and disease phenotypes is reflected in variable pain symptom presentations, unpredictable fertility potential, uncertain disease pathophysiology, and unpredictable responses to medical therapies, symptom and disease recurrence after surgical resection, and risks for co-morbidities. Clinical classifications of endometriosis are maladapted to the heterogeneity of disease expression, and thus efficient treatments for associated pain symptoms are lacking. Herein, our UCSF Stanford Endometriosis Center for Discovery, Innovation, Training and Community Engagement (“ENACT”) proposes a comprehensive systems biology and precision medicine approach to endometriosis. We propose to study endometriosis unmet needs and challenges through transdisciplinary collaboration and scientific and technologic innovations, integrating multi-omics data to dissect endometriosis disease mechanisms, identify phenotypic and environmental disease signatures, develop accurate disease stratification and diagnosis, and identify novel and repurposed drug classes to ameliorate pain symptoms. To achieve these goals, our Center is comprised of 3 independent and interactive projects and 2 Cores, focused on the central theme of Endometriosis Precision Medicine. Project 1 will focus on underlying immunological mechanisms in endometriosis pathogenesis and pathophysiology. Project 2 will address developing a multi- omic disease classification that will inform diagnostic strategies, and Project 3 will leverage existing and newly generated large-scale omic data to identify and validate new therapeutic interventions. Our long-standing Human Endometrial Tissue and DNA Bank and REDCap database and ongoing accruals with our collaborating network of surgeons will be a major resource for this Center's project. The Center will have an Administrative Core and an Education and Community Outreach Core that will engage students from the Bay Area in our research programs and empower women in our community and address health disparities associated with endometriosis. To achieve these goals, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators at UCSF and Stanford University, many of whom are new to endometriosis research, as well as educators, trainees, and community representatives who are all committed to improve the lives of women and teen girls with endometriosis.

"Cerebral oscillations of pain Summary Chronic pain disorders are amongst the most burdensome of all diseases in terms of their impact on the individual and the costs to society. The development of novel therapeutic approaches for chronic pain have relied on basic studies involving genetic and molecular approaches in rodent models of pain, but existing drugs generally provide very limited relief for only a small number of patients. The result is that a vast number of people with chronic pain go untreated and have only partial relief. There is substantial and growing evidence from within and outside the pain research fields that indicates neural oscillations reflect cognitive, emotional, and sensory processes, which are all components of the pain experience. Furthermore, we can target these oscillatory patterns to alter perception. In particular, alpha band activity has been associated with chronic pain, and our extensive recent work and preliminary findings indicate that alpha can reliably predict future sensitivity to pain experienced minutes to weeks in the future in healthy subjects. In the proposed studies, we use simultaneous EEG-fMRI to continue our ongoing work on alpha oscillations as pain mechanisms and extend it to test the specificity and sensitivity of the signals and the relationship between alpha, brain networks, and pain. The proposed work would lead to improved understanding of the neurobiology of pain, identify novel brain targets for new or improved interventions, and potentially reveal a prognostic biomarker that would be useful for testing new therapeutic approaches and objectively assessing clinical improvement on an individual basis. Narrative Development of treatments for chronic pain has been limited, but the potential for using brain signal predictive and prognostic biomarkers is growing. In the proposed studies we aim to understand the mechanisms of an electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain oscillation that predicts pain sensitivity in healthy subjects. The findings will provide a major step forward in the development of novel therapies for chronic pain and individualized treatment approaches.",Cerebral oscillations of pain,10207807,R01NS112356,"['Affect', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Emotional', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Pain-Free', 'Painless', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persistent pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Rodent Model', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning method', 'mindfulness intervention', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive brain stimulation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pain model', 'pain sensitivity', 'predictive marker', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'vector']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,403771
"Development of a deep neural network to measure spontaneous pain from mouse facial expressions PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid analgesics are commonly used to treat pain but have serious side effects, including addiction, dependence, and death from overdose. While there is a significant need for new non-addictive analgesics, efforts to develop new pain medicines have met with limited success. In part, this failure is due to an overreliance on evoked pain measures in preclinical models. Indeed, most preclinical models do not measure spontaneous pain—the main symptom of chronic pain in humans. To increase translational relevance, the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) was developed to quantify characteristic facial expressions associated with spontaneous pain. The MGS is reproducible across labs and was used to evaluate the efficacy of analgesics. However, the MGS has not been widely adopted due to its high resource demands and low throughput. To overcome this limitation, we adapted a machine learning model to classify the presence or absence of pain from mouse facial expressions. We called this model the automated Mouse Grimace Scale (aMGS). After training, this model identified mice in pain with 94% accuracy, comparable to a highly-trained human. However, our original “aMGS 1.0” is limited in several respects. It is only accurate at detecting facial grimacing in white- coated mice, and produces a binary assessment (“pain” vs. “no pain”) instead of a graded score. Moreover, aMGS 1.0 cannot dynamically determine pain status from full-motion videos. Additionally, we relied on an older piece of software that does not consistently extract high-quality images of the mouse face. The aMGS 1.0 also has difficulty distinguishing between images of sleeping and grimacing mice. Finally, aMGS 1.0 suffers from a “black box” problem inherent to most machine learning algorithms, in that we do not know what facial details it uses to produce a pain assessment. Here we propose to overcome all of these limitations by developing a more sophisticated version of our automated pain classifier (aMGS 2.0). To achieve this goal we will: 1) Develop and validate a new open-source platform to classify (frame-by-frame) spontaneous pain intensity from mouse facial expressions, using albino (white) mice and motion information. 2) Enhance the generality of aMGS 2.0 for use with black mice. And, 3) Develop a user-friendly web-based platform that operates on computer-based and mobile devices. We will validate the utility of aMGS with three pain assays that produce grimaces in rodents—inflammatory pain, post-surgical (laparotomy) pain, and neuropathic pain. To increase rigor and reproducibility, two pain assays will be performed and scored with aMGS 2.0 in an independent lab. Numerous investigators in the pain field have expressed interest in using our proposed model. The platform will include a cloud-based data repository and analytic tools to facilitate curation of public data, continuous improvement of the model over time, and integration of new analytic tools. One analytic tool that we plan to develop will identify mouse features that most influence pain classification. NARRATIVE As the opioid epidemic has made clear, there is significant need to develop new ways to study chronic pain and relief of pain in preclinical models. Development of an accurate and broadly useful machine learning model and web-based platform will make it possible for researchers to objectively quantify and study spontaneous pain in mice, and hence provide a way to more rapidly identify and validate new analgesic drugs.",Development of a deep neural network to measure spontaneous pain from mouse facial expressions,10094266,R01NS114259,"['Acetic Acids', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Analgesics', 'Animal Model', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Regions', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Database Management Systems', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Pain', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Laparotomy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Reflex action', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'blind', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain relief', 'cloud based', 'convolutional neural network', 'data repository', 'deep neural network', 'efficacy evaluation', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'inflammatory pain', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'overdose death', 'pain relief', 'painful neuropathy', 'persistent symptom', 'pre-clinical', 'recurrent neural network', 'side effect', 'smartphone Application', 'spontaneous pain', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web services']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,362249
"Central glutamate signaling in postoperative pain regulation - Renewal Postoperative pain is a major morbidity, and persistent opioid use after surgery has contributed to an epidemic. An improved mechanistic understanding of how pain is regulated within the brain can lead to novel non-opioid analgesic development. The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the central regulation of postoperative pain. The objective of the current application is to define the role of prelimbic cortex (PL) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), two key components of the prefrontal cortex in rodents, in the regulation of acute and chronic postoperative pain. The PL is homologous to human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that is known to undergo synaptic changes with chronic pain, and the ACC is a well-described region for processing affective component of pain across species. Our central hypothesis is that an imbalance in neural activities in the PL and ACC contributes to symptoms of postoperative pain and thus forms a therapeutic target. Our hypothesis is supported by the current literature showing that the PL has a pain-inhibitory role, whereas the ACC enhances pain aversion, and that chronic pain causes increased excitability in the ACC and hypo-excitability in the PL. It is also supported by our recent results demonstrating that AMPAkines and ketamine, drugs that alter glutamate signaling and shape cortical circuits, reduce pain. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that an imbalance in ACC and PL activities contributes to postoperative pain in awake freely behaving rats. We will use paw incision (PI) to mimic acute reversible incisional pain, and spared nerve injury (SNI) to model chronic pain after intraoperative nerve damage. We will first correlate imbalanced prefrontal activities with pain, by showing a concurrent loss of nociceptive response in the PL and gain of response in the ACC as pain behavior persists, and the resolution of such neural changes as pain resolves, using simultaneous in vivo extracellular recordings of the PL and ACC. Further, to test the causal effect of this imbalance on pain, we will show that optogenetic PL activation, or ACC inhibition, reverses postoperative pain behaviors. Next, we will use optrode recordings to dissect a local pain- regulatory circuit fromthe PL to the ACC. Further, we will use an unbiased supervised machine learning analysis to validate the relationship between the imbalance in PL and ACC activities and the chronicity of postoperative pain. In Aim 2, We will test the hypothesis that pharmacologic and electrical neuromodulation can target imbalanced PL/ACC activities in the postoperative pain state. We will show that AMPAkines and ketamine increase PL outputs and reduce ACC activities to inhibit pain and optimize the timing and dosing regimens for these drugs and test therapeutic synergy. We will also optimize invasive and non-invasive electrical stimulation protocols in the PL to treat pain. This project is innovative because it applies a new systems neuroscience approach with cutting-edge techniques to uncover a central pain-regulatory mechanism. The work is significant because it produces novel applications of FDA-approved drugs (ketamine and APMAkines) for postoperative pain and a blueprint for new deep brain or transcranial stimulation methods to treat pain. Precise understanding of the central mechanisms for postoperative pain is needed to develop novel analgesics and address the current opioid epidemic.

"Development of selective calpain-1 inhibitors for chronic pain PROJECT SUMMARY Never in the history of the United States has the unmet medical need to develop novel, non-opioid therapeutics for chronic pain been more urgent than it is today. More than 65 million US adults suffer from chronic pain, resulting in almost $635 billion in annual healthcare costs. Despite their limited efficacy, and potential for addiction, tolerance, and impaired motor performance, opioids have become a mainstay for chronic pain management, resulting in an opioid epidemic that is ravaging communities throughout the US. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel, non-opioid therapies for chronic pain management. This application addresses this unmet medical need by leveraging our novel artificial intelligence (AI)-driven drug discovery platform to develop selective inhibitors of calpain-1 as novel non-opioid therapeutics for chronic pain. Studies in chronic neuropathic pain animal models have shown that nerve injury overactivates calpain-1, which downregulates K+ Cl- cotransporter activity, resulting in diminished synaptic inhibition and neuropathic pain. Prior work by our group has also shown that both pharmacological inhibition and whole body genetic knockout of calpain-1 attenuates chronic pain behaviors in mouse models of sickle cell disease (SCD). Importantly, the analgesic effect of calpain-1 inhibition did not induce tolerance side effects, suggesting the potential for calpain-1 inhibitors to be non-addictive. By applying our innovative artificial intelligence (AI)-driven drug discovery platform to screen a virtual chemical library, we identified four (4) novel calpain-1 inhibitors, and validated them for efficacy in biochemical assays. Here, we propose to progress our most potent hit compound to a lead compound that is calpain-1 selective, cysteine protease family selective, non-opioid, and CNS penetrant with efficacy demonstrated in at least 1 of 3 chronic pain animal models tested, including chronic sickle cell disease pain, chronic inflammatory pain, and chronic neuropathic pain. Three aims are proposed, including Aim 1: Synthesize ~100 analogs of our most potent hit compound, and characterize in vitro activity and selectivity. Success criteria: Top 20 cell-permeable, calpain-1 inhibitors, moderately selective against calpain-2, and highly selective against cathepsins and caspase-1, Aim 2: Evaluate ADME-Tox and PK profile of our top 20 calpain-1 inhibitors from Aim 1. Success criteria: Top 2 CNS-penetrant selective calpain-1 inhibitors with favorable in vivo PK profile, and Aim 3: Determine the efficacy and PK/PD relationship of our top calpain-1 inhibitor in 3 chronic pain animal models. Success: at least 40% reduction in mechanical hyperalgesia in at least 1 of the 3 chronic pain animal models tested. Successful completion of this Phase I will yield a novel CNS-penetrant, selective calpain-1inhibitor with efficacy demonstrated in at least 1 chronic pain animal model. Our overall product would be the first, oral, CNS acting, selective calpain-1 inhibitor for chronic pain. Importantly, our product would reduce opioid usage in chronic pain patients, and help to stem the US opioid epidemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Never in the history of the United States has the unmet medical need to develop novel, non-opioid therapeutics for chronic pain been more urgent than it is today.

"Integrating Pragmatic Comparative Effectiveness Research into a Tertiary Pain Management Center Project Summary: Chronic pain is a major healthcare problem with an annual cost of above $600 billion. The quality of data available for treatments of chronic pain is not optimal. Generalizability of explanatory randomized controlled trial data is problematic as these trials exclude up to 90% of patients: leaving out real-world patients with serious medical and psychological comorbidities. Pragmatic trials embedded in patient care compare effectiveness of currently used treatments in real-world application leading to findings that generalize to broader range of patients. The changes in clinical practice and workflow necessary to integrate this type of research within patient care present pragmatic challenges. In this research, my overall objective is to overcome these challenges using an open-source learning health care system – CHOIR – developed by my mentor at the Stanford Pain Management Center. CHOIR is currently used to track patients’ clinical trajectory and treatment response across multiple academic sites resulting in over 25 publications characterizing chronic pain. Through our pilot studies, we have already developed a point-of-care randomization for CHOIR that facilitates integration of research and patient care by allowing the physicians to randomize patients during clinic visits. We have already demonstrated feasibility of the randomization and data collection platform in two ongoing pilot pragmatic clinical trials. We are proposing to better integrate pragmatic research within our clinical practice through conducting a randomized comparative effectiveness trial in 450 patients with chronic pain comparing effectiveness of anti- convulsants and anti-depressants (two most commonly used classes of medications for treatment of chronic pain). We will use the data available in CHOIR as well as the real-world data generated from this clinical trial to build, validate and test a model to predict what clinical characteristics can predict response to either of these classes of medications. The proposed study is the first step to use flexible point-of-care randomization to compare effectiveness of different treatments in different subgroups of patients whenever equipoise exists. Our prediction model will guide decision making process of clinicians choosing between these medications based on clinical characteristics of individual patients. Dr. Salmasi is a physician-scientist with clinical training in Pain Medicine as well as academic training in Clinical Research and Epidemiology. The detailed career development and research plan presented in this application will provide the required resources and mentorship for him to become an independent R01-funded expert in two domains critical to his long-term career goals: (1) advanced clinical trial design and conduct; and (2) advanced statistics and machine learning. Project Narrative Chronic pain is a major healthcare problem with annual cost of above $600 billion in the United States; generalizability of available evidence for treatment of chronic pain (mostly from traditional explanatory randomized controlled trial data) is problematic as these trials exclude up to 90% of patients: leaving out real- world patients with serious medical and psychological comorbidities. We will perform a pragmatic randomized comparative effectiveness trial using our point-of-care randomization. We will then use the data from this trial to build a model predicting the response to anti-convulsants and anti-depressants to develop a platform for precision health: predicting how to choose the best medication for each patient with chronic pain.",Integrating Pragmatic Comparative Effectiveness Research into a Tertiary Pain Management Center,10216024,K23NS120039,"['Academic Training', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Equipoise', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Institution', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Pain', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Precision Health', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain patient', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical pain', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning algorithm', 'open source', 'pain catastrophizing', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'point of care', 'pragmatic trial', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'real world application', 'research and development', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193536
"Cortical information integration as a model for pain perception and behavior Sensory processing requires the interaction between external inputs and an internal brain state. Pain is a unique sensory experience that is triggered by external signals, but is also strongly shaped by internal cognitive and emotional variables. At the circuit level, there is not a single primary pain cortex; instead, a distributed network of cortical areas process and regulate pain. For example, the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is known to process stimulus-evoked information, such as location and timing. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), in contrast, gives rise to the aversive experience of pain and displays a high level of neuronal plasticity in the chronic pain state. Meanwhile, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) can strongly modulate pain behaviors. However, the mechanisms whereby these distributed cortical pain circuits integrate information remain largely unknown. Thus, we propose a novel conceptual and computational framework for pain as a converging, temporally specific, interaction among the S1, the ACC, and the PFC. This interaction can be described by a predictive coding framework that combines feedforward inputs with top-down predictions dependent on prior aversive experiences, and modulatory commands, based on neural activities in the S1, ACC and PFC. To test this hypothesis, we will create a new set of tools for pain studies. We will design devices to accurately measure pain responses; engineer closed-loop brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to selectively perturb cortical circuits during the precise time course of pain; and define novel statistical methods such as mechanistic mean-field models to analyze dynamic cortical information integration, using local field potentials (LFPs) and ensemble spikes. In Aim 1, we will identify the impact of the nociceptive information on central pain circuit dynamics. We will characterize the directed information flow between the S1, ACC, and PFC (more specifically the prelimbic PFC), before and after noxious stimulation. We will create closed-loop BCIs using a real-time pain detection algorithm based on statistical analyses of simultaneous spikes and LFPs in the S1 and ACC to optogenetically modulate the S1, and show that such perturbations disrupt the integration of signals from the ACC and PFC to impact pain behaviors. We will also analyze how chronic pain alters predictive coding schemes and response to acute pain. In Aim 2, we will use BCIs to test the impact of ACC modulation on neural activities in the S1 and PFC, as well as on pain behaviors. More importantly, we will show that chronic pain can induce maladaptive plasticity in the ACC, which in turn alters the information flow from the S1 and PFC to give rise to pain anticipation and tonic pain – two examples of pain experience driven by an internal aversive state. In Aim 3, we will show that BCI-driven modulation of PFC outputs can provide scalable regulation of the nociceptive information flow from the S1 and ACC to alter pain behaviors. Further, we will show how such cortical modulation is impaired by chronic pain. PROJECT NARRATIVE Incomplete understanding of central mechanisms of pain has contributed to the dual public health crises of pain under-treatment and opioid overuse/misuse. The proposed research seeks to provide a novel predictive coding model for pain, based on multi-scale neural activities in the primary somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and the prefrontal cortex. Our new conceptual model indicates that dynamic integration of cortical circuits encode the perception of pain and has translational implications for pain diagnosis and treatment.",Cortical information integration as a model for pain perception and behavior,10205303,R01NS121776,"['Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Freund&apos', 's Adjuvant', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neocortex', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nociception', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Peripheral', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Withdrawal', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'central pain', 'chronic pain', 'cingulate cortex', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experience', 'machine learning method', 'millisecond', 'nerve injury', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'opioid overuse', 'optogenetics', 'pain behavior', 'pain model', 'pain perception', 'pain signal', 'predictive test', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'sensory integration', 'sensory neuroscience', 'spared nerve', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,1100000
"Neuroimmune Interface in Urological Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (UCPPS) is a debilitating urologic condition characterized by bladder/pelvic pain and urinary symptoms such as urgency and frequency. Treating UCPPS remains a serious challenge for clinicians in part because the mechanisms of the disease are not well understood. This challenge is even greater when patients have pain outside the pelvis and/or comorbid pain syndromes, as the central nervous system (CNS) may play a significant role in their symptoms, a phenomenon we term “centralized” pain. The Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network was initiated in response to these challenges. In a site-specific study conducted during first phase of MAPP, we showed that when immune cells isolated from UCPPS patients are stimulated ex vivo, the resulting inflammatory response distinguishes patients with localized pain from those with a more widespread pain presentation. In the second phase of MAPP, samples of stimulated whole blood have been collected on the vast majority of patients in conjunction with functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI), psychophysical sensory testing, and a comprehensive battery of patient reported outcomes. However, as the second phase of MAPP draws to a close, funding is not available to analyze these stimulated samples. In the current project, we propose to complete this critical work and elucidate how inflammation influences the CNS in UCPPS. We have assembled a team of MAPP investigators and added expertise in clustering and classification bioinformatics in order to address three scientific aims. AIM 1: Validate the inflammatory phenotype of UCPPS. (A) We will replicate and extend our previous cross-sectional findings indicating that stimulated inflammatory responses may be able to classify UCPPS patients with greater clinical evidence of centralized pain (test n = 200, validation n = 200). (B) We will determine if longitudinal changes in genitourinary symptoms and pain over 18 months are paralleled by changes in the stimulated inflammatory responses in a subset of these patients (n = 250). AIM 2: Identify a neurobiological signature of the inflammatory phenotype using fcMRI and psychophysical sensory testing. (A) We will conduct cross-sectional analyses to identify neurobiological correlates of the inflammatory phenotype (test n = 200, validation n = 200). (B) We will create longitudinal models to determine if identified fcMRI and psychophysical outcomes co-vary with inflammation over time (n = 250). AIM 3: Identify biotypes of UCPPS using combined inflammatory, neuroimaging, psychophysical, and clinical data. We will use bioinformatics techniques including canonical correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering to attempt to define unique, latent, biotypes of UCPPS. We hypothesize that these biotypes will reflect different clinical phenotypes and may be useful for predicting treatment responses. The impact of these studies is that they may lead to novel therapeutic targets and tailored treatments for UCPPS by elucidating an important and under-studied mechanism of UCPPS symptomology. Project Narrative: Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome is a highly prevalent and debilitating chronic pain condition for which current treatments are inadequate.

"Profiling the human gut microbiome for potential analgesic bacterial therapies The human gut microbiome is an essential component of host physiology: it modulates immune activity, influences the balance of neurotransmitters both peripherally and centrally, and produces a vast and variable array of small-molecule metabolites which enter circulation to impact distal body sites. It is highly heritable, implying a symbiosis that has developed over evolutionary timescales, but is also susceptible to the influence of diet and other factors such as antibiotic use. Notably, disruptions in microbiome composition are associated with a number of disorders characterized by chronic pain and inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia. Given the microbiome’s immunomodulatory and metabolic capacities, and its role as a pseudo- endogenous component of human biology, human gut-derived bacteria are a promising potential source of novel, safe, and non-addictive therapeutics for pain management. However, the mechanisms underlying the “gut–pain axis” are still being elucidated, and key functional drivers of the observed connections have yet to be identified. As such, to advance the development of microbiome-derived biotherapeutics for pain management, the goals of this project are: to identify human-gut-native bacteria capable of engaging established pain targets in vitro, to validate their activity and analgesic/anti-inflammatory potential in vivo, and to develop a computational tool to predict microbial-genetic drivers of response, which can guide future mechanism validation and therapeutic development. Because the vast majority of human gut bacteria are strictly anaerobic, they cannot be cultivated using typical laboratory equipment and techniques. This has historically presented a roadblock in mechanistic explorations of the gut microbiome’s therapeutic potential, resulting in a focus on “culture-independent” methods such as metagenomics—approaches that produce a wealth of correlative data, but little by way of causal validation. Holobiome is uniquely suited to meet this complex challenge, having overcome the difficulties inherent in anaerobic cultivation to build an in-house strain library of nearly ten thousand bacterial isolates from a variety of donors which contains representatives of nearly every major human gut-bacterial taxon cultured to date. This resource, along with an assembled team bringing extensive experience in microbiology, mammalian cell culture and assay development, and computational genomics, will allow a diverse library of human gut bacteria to be individually screened for their capacity to modulate cytokine response, cyclooxygenase expression, TRP channel activity, and other targets with high therapeutic potential for pain. This approach is expected to provide concrete insights on the mechanisms by which the gut microbiome influences nociception and the inflammatory response, with implications for the development of novel non-opioid analgesics. Findings of this research may also have translational potential for the treatment of autoimmune disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease, which has both autoimmune components and demonstrated links to the microbiome. While a rapidly growing body of research ties perturbations in the human gut microbiome to countless aspects of health and disease, most of this work is correlative in nature and provides relatively little information regarding the direction of causality and the mechanisms involved. This project, which aims to identify human gut-native bacteria capable of modulating nociception and inflammation, will generate valuable insight on the roles of specific gut taxa and bacterial genes in regulating pain sensitivity. The outcome of this project will represent a major step toward the development of novel non-opioid analgesics with a strong safety profile, which may also help stem the ongoing opioid crisis.",Profiling the human gut microbiome for potential analgesic bacterial therapies,10398329,R34NS126030,"['Adjuvant Arthritis', 'Advanced Development', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Analgesics', 'Animals', 'Anti Inflammatory Analgesics', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Autoimmune', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteriophages', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diclofenac', 'Diet', 'Dinoprostone', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Ecology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Freund&apos', 's Adjuvant', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunologics', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nociception', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Preparation', 'Probiotics', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spinal Cord', 'Surveys', 'Symbiosis', 'TNF gene', 'TRP channel', 'Taxon', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxin', 'Validation', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'assay development', 'chronic pain', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'design', 'dietary', 'experience', 'fecal transplantation', 'genome database', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'immunoregulation', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'laboratory equipment', 'lipidomics', 'macrophage', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome therapeutics', 'neurotransmission', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'pain model', 'pain sensitivity', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NINDS,"HOLOBIOME, INC.",R34,2021,1446416
"Mentoring in Discovery and Validation of Clinical Chronic Pain Biomarkers The primary goal of this K24 application is to allow Sean Mackey, M.D., Ph.D., to build and expand on his high- quality and intensive mentorship of early-career investigators in patient-oriented research (POR). Dr. Mackey is the Redlich Professor and Chief, Division of Pain Medicine at Stanford University. This K24 provides Dr. Mackey with the critical protected time for POR and mentoring that would otherwise be spent on administrative and clinical responsibilities.  Dr. Mackey's mentoring plan for this K24 application builds on his currently funded HEAL project entitled: “Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for high-impact chronic pain: Development and validation”. Chronic pain represents a public health crisis that affects more than 100 million Americans and costs over $500 billion annually. An estimated 8% of US adults suffer from high-impact chronic pain, or pain associated with substantially restricted work, social, and self-care activities for six or more months. Subgroups of individuals respond entirely, do not change, or even worsen following pain management. Thus, robust and validated diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are needed to identify those with high-impact chronic pain and determine the trajectory of outcome (i.e., recovery versus persistence), respectively. Therefore, our overall goal is to discover and validate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for musculoskeletal high-impact chronic pain. This goal will require comprehensive, multidimensional assessments with an integrated dataset and a sophisticated computational analysis pipeline to yield reliable and validated diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. To this end, we have assembled an interdisciplinary research and clinical team to implement the HEAL initiative.  Dr. Mackey's mentoring plan includes training his mentees in: 1) designing and implementing pain research studies; 2) preparing scientific papers and presentations; 3) writing successful grant applications; 4) the responsible conduct of research; and 5) successful navigation of the academic process to achieve scientific independence. This mentoring plan will be applied to the K grantees he mentors and those he oversees as the Program Director for his NIDA T32 “Interdisciplinary Research Training in Pain and Substance Use Disorders.” The mentees will engage in the training activites in three manners. The first is through direct involvement in the parent R61/R33 biomarker project via participation in aspects of the research project. The second is through seminars, journal clubs, meetings, and coursework that expands on our T32 Training Program focusing on this HEAL biomarker project. The third is through trainee-led pilot projects that leverage the parent project resources and associated multidisciplinary infrastructure. The funded HEAL project, combined with the additional mentoring time provided by the K24, will provide an exceptional POR training and mentoring platform for our large group of current and future K awardees, T32 fellows, and other trainees – and facilitate their transition into independent patient-oriented pain researchers. Project Narrative: Chronic pain has a tremendous impact on the individual and society as a whole. We need clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarker signatures to identify those with high-impact chronic pain and determine the trajectory of outcome.

"P-QST Project: Pancreatic Quantitative Sensory Testing (P-QST) to Predict Treatment Response for Pain in Chronic Pancreatitis ABSTRACT: Abdominal pain is the primary driver of morbidity in chronic pancreatitis (CP) and affects approximately 90% of patients over the course of their disease with devastating effects on quality of life. Etiology of pain in CP is multi-factorial. Patients with evidence of pancreatic duct obstruction due to stones and/or strictures are offered invasive treatments such as endotherapy or surgical drainage to relieve pain. However, response to invasive treatments is unpredictable, and currently no clinical tool is available to identify patients who will respond to technically successful treatment. The lack of pain response is at least partially due to supraspinal central sensitization (SCS), a phenomenon of neuropathic and neuroplastic remodeling resulting from persistent pain stimuli. Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), an investigative technique of standardized stimulations to test nociception (the neural signaling that encodes noxious stimuli and the downstream experience of pain), is used in other pain conditions to differentiate between patient subgroups to guide treatment. QST has the potential to change the management algorithm of patients with painful CP. Our preliminary data show that pancreatic QST (P-QST) can phenotype patients with CP into three groups: normal pain processing, segmental (T10 dermatome at the pancreas) sensitization, and widespread hyperalgesia (consistent with SCS). In this proposal, we will evaluate the ability of P-QST to predict response to invasive treatment for painful CP, and to develop a predictive model for individualized prediction of treatment response. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Test the predictive capability of pre-treatment P-QST phenotype for pain improvement following invasive treatment for painful CP. Using pre-procedure P-QST, we will phenotype 150 patients undergoing clinically-indicated invasive treatment for painful CP at UPMC and Johns Hopkins University. Our primary outcome will be average pain score measured by Numeric Rating Scale at 6 months post-intervention. Aim 2. Incorporate P-QST with known and suspected patient, disease, and treatment- related factors to create a model for individualized prediction of response to invasive treatment. Using machine learning tools, we will develop a model that optimizes the prediction of probability of response to invasive treatment in individual patients. This will also determine the relative strength of P-QST as an overall predictor of treatment response. Aim 3. Augment the predictive model (Aim 2) with biochemical inflammatory markers to assess the potential to increase predictive capability for pain improvement following invasive treatment for painful CP. The predictive model developed in aim 2 will be further strengthened by incorporating serum neuroinflammatory markers at baseline. Our findings will be a major step toward development of individualized prediction of treatment response following invasive treatment for painful CP. They will lay the foundation for multicenter studies to fully define the role of P-QST in locally invasive and other treatments for pain management for painful CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Abdominal pain in chronic pancreatitis (CP) affects approximately 90% of patients and is the primary driver of morbidity, poor quality of life, and health care utilization. Response to currently available therapies is suboptimal and predicting which individuals will respond to invasive treatment has not been possible to date. The proposed clinical trial will evaluate the predictive capability of Pancreatic Quantitative Sensory Testing (P- QST, a novel assessment of neurosensory phenotyping) for improvement in pain (a health-related outcome) in patients with CP who are undergoing medically-indicated invasive treatment with endoscopic therapy or surgery.",P-QST Project: Pancreatic Quantitative Sensory Testing (P-QST) to Predict Treatment Response for Pain in Chronic Pancreatitis,10297329,R01DK127042,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Denmark', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drainage procedure', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Enrollment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Etiology', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Nociception', 'Nomograms', 'Numeric Rating Scale', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain management', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Pancreatic duct', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persistent pain', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Up-Regulation', 'Urine', 'Visceral', 'Wages', 'central pain', 'central sensitization', 'chemokine', 'chronic pancreatitis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'demographics', 'dermatome', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurosensory', 'neurotransmission', 'nociceptive response', 'novel', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'pain processing', 'pain reduction', 'pain relief', 'pain score', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized predictions', 'post intervention', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'productivity loss', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'success', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,580393
"Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated  Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) ABSTRACT There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest pain, one of the most common and potentially deadliest conditions encountered in acute care settings. The ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain patients, yet is currently only diagnostic for a small subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Our well-rounded and collaborative team has been working together for the past four years to develop novel ECG interpretation algorithms that can greatly enhance the utility of the ECG in the early evaluation of acute coronary disease. This line of work is already substantiated by pilot studies that have identified candidate markers of ECG characteristics and preliminary algorithms that can identify patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction as well as those with very low risk of coronary artery disease. With these improved tools, emergency providers (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) will be able to streamline the care provided to these patients beyond the costly and time- consuming overnight observation for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing. This grant will provide needed resources for our team to enroll a cohort of over 1,800 patients needed to confirm the accuracy of these ECG markers and determine their maximal clinical utility as part of a risk stratification tool. It builds directly on our existing work in this area, which has already yielded necessary preliminary data and multiple joint publications. Validating this technology will set the groundwork for the future development and testing of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. SUMMARY/NARRATIVE Current guidelines for diagnosing and treating myocardial infarction (MI) are based on identifying ST elevation (STE) on the 12-lead ECG, yet only one third of MI patients exhibit such elevation. We propose to (1) extend our prior research of novel repolarization indices of non-STE MI available on the initial ECG and (2) incorporate this information into real-time machine-learning algorithms for clinical decision support, which will improve our sensitivity in detecting and treating MI very early during urgent care. Such early and non-invasively acquired diagnostics can improve outcomes and save costs for millions of patients with chest pain annually.",Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART),10086875,R01HL137761,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Attenuated', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infarction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Muscle strain', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Nitrates', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pain Measurement', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pre-hospital setting', 'Pre-hospitalization care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Troponin', 'Unstable angina', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'billing data', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical examination', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'injured', 'innovation', 'ischemic injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pain patient', 'patient subsets', 'perfusion imaging', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'reduce symptoms', 'risk stratification', 'secondary outcome', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urgent care']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,369024
